Introduction

The Department of Public Information, in collaboration with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Policy and Analysis Unit, presents this detailed analytical report on SDG 2 - Zero Hunger. This report focuses on the progress made in least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) towards achieving SDG 2 targets.

Context and Challenges for LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs

LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs face particular challenges in achieving SDG 2 due to a combination of geographical, economic, and environmental factors. These countries often have limited natural resources, vulnerable ecosystems, and a high dependence on agriculture, which is susceptible to factors such as climate change, natural disasters, and conflicts.

In addition, these countries face unique accessibility and connectivity challenges. LLDCs, for example, are landlocked and often rely on neighboring countries for trade and food security. SIDS, on the other hand, are vulnerable to water scarcity, coastal erosion, and sea-level rise, which adversely affect food availability and food security. LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs also suffer from limited financial resources, weak institutional capacities, and high levels of poverty.

Progress and Achievements

Despite these challenges, significant progress has been made towards achieving SDG 2 in LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs. According to the latest data, the prevalence of undernourishment has declined significantly in these countries in recent years. In 2019, the prevalence of undernourishment in LDCs stood at 24.9%, down from 29.6% in 2000. SIDS and LLDCs also witnessed a decline in undernourishment, with prevalence rates of 6.4% and 18.6%, respectively.

Improvements have been made in increasing agricultural productivity and reducing post-harvest losses. LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs have implemented agricultural practices that promote sustainable and climate-resilient agriculture, including conservation agriculture, agroforestry, and sustainable soil management. These practices have led to increased agricultural yields and improved livelihoods for smallholder farmers.

Efforts have also been made to increase access to affordable and nutritious food. Social protection programs, such as conditional cash transfers and school feeding programs, have been implemented to ensure vulnerable populations have access to adequate food. In LDCs, progress has been made in reducing the number of people living in extreme poverty, which has a direct impact on food security.

Challenges and Opportunities

While progress has been made, challenges persist in achieving SDG 2 in LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs. Climate change continues to pose a significant threat to agricultural production and food security in these countries. Erratic weather patterns, prolonged droughts, and increased frequency and intensity of natural disasters have disrupted agricultural activities and threatened food availability.

Inadequate infrastructure, limited access to credit, and unsustainable farming practices also hinder progress. LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs need additional investments and support in developing sustainable agricultural infrastructure, promoting technology transfer, and capacity building. Improving access to credit and financial resources will enable smallholder farmers in these countries to invest in modern farming equipment and technologies.

Addressing inequalities in food distribution and access is another crucial challenge. Efforts should be focused on developing inclusive agricultural policies that promote equitable distribution of resources, facilitate the participation of women and indigenous communities, and support youth engagement in sustainable agriculture.

Opportunities for collaboration and partnerships exist and should be capitalized on. Improved regional and international cooperation can enable the sharing of best practices, knowledge, and technology transfer among LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs. This can significantly enhance agricultural productivity, promote sustainable food systems and nutrition, and contribute to achieving SDG 2.

Conclusion

In summary, while significant progress has been made in LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs towards achieving SDG 2, challenges persist and require targeted interventions. Efforts should focus on enhancing agricultural productivity, improving infrastructure and access to credit, addressing climate change-related risks, reducing inequalities, and promoting inclusive and sustainable food systems. Continued collaboration and partnerships are crucial to ensure that no one is left behind in the journey towards zero hunger.
