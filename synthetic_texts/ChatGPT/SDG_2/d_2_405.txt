Introduction:
This analytical report, prepared by the Center for Victims of Torture (CVT), aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of the progress made towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) - Zero Hunger. SDG 2 aims to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030. The report analyzes the current state of SDG 2, identifies key challenges, and provides recommendations for achieving the goal.

1. Overview of SDG 2:
SDG 2 seeks to eradicate hunger and malnutrition by improving access to nutritious and sufficient food for all, particularly vulnerable populations such as women, children, and rural communities. It also aims to promote sustainable agriculture practices, maintain genetic diversity, and increase investments in the agricultural sector.

2. Progress Made:
Significant progress has been made towards achieving SDG 2 since its adoption in 2015. Globally, the prevalence of undernourishment has been steadily declining, with extreme hunger decreasing from 14.7% in 2010 to 10.9% in 2019. Many countries have increased their efforts to reduce hunger and improve nutrition through various programs and policies. However, progress has not been uniform across regions, and disparities persist between and within countries.

3. Key Challenges:
3.1 Food Insecurity:
Despite the overall progress, food insecurity remains a significant challenge, particularly in least developed countries and regions affected by conflict or climate change. Economic inequalities, limited access to resources, and unstable social and political situations exacerbate the problem of food insecurity. Climate change impacts, such as droughts, floods, and changing weather patterns, further undermine agricultural productivity and threaten food security.

3.2 Malnutrition:
The prevalence of malnutrition, both undernutrition, and overnutrition (obesity), is still unacceptably high. Poor nutrition not only leads to adverse health outcomes but also undermines economic productivity and human development. Addressing both forms of malnutrition requires a concerted effort and a comprehensive approach that takes into account various factors influencing eating habits and access to nutritious food.

3.3 Unsustainable Agriculture Practices:
Unsustainable agriculture practices, including excessive use of fertilizers, overexploitation of resources, and deforestation, continue to degrade ecosystems and threaten food security in the long run. The agricultural sector must transition towards sustainable practices, including climate-smart agriculture, conservation agriculture, and agroforestry, to ensure the long-term viability of food production and environmental conservation.

4. Recommendations:
4.1 Investment in Agricultural Development:
Governments and international organizations should increase investment in agricultural development, focusing on small-scale farmers, women, and youth. Access to credit, technical assistance, and advanced technologies should be improved to enhance productivity and sustainable agricultural practices.

4.2 Strengthening Social Protection and Safety Nets:
Enhancing social protection mechanisms, such as cash transfer programs, school feeding initiatives, and nutrition-sensitive schemes, will improve the nutrition status of vulnerable populations and alleviate the burden of food insecurity. These initiatives should target households living in poverty, women, children, and refugees.

4.3 Enhancing Resilience to Climate Change:
Efforts should be made to build resilience in agricultural systems, especially in vulnerable regions, by promoting climate-smart practices and providing necessary infrastructure to address climate risks. Integrated programs that combine climate adaptation and sustainable agriculture can create more resilient food systems.

4.4 Collaboration and Partnerships:
Partnerships between governments, civil society, private sector, international organizations, and local communities are crucial for achieving SDG 2. Collaboration should aim to strengthen institutions, share knowledge and resources, and promote inclusive policies, ensuring multi-stakeholder engagement throughout the implementation process.

Conclusion:
While progress toward achieving SDG 2 has been made, accelerating efforts and addressing the persistent challenges is essential to achieve a world free from hunger and malnutrition. Governments, international organizations, civil society, and individuals must work together in implementing inclusive and sustainable strategies that will improve food security, nutrition, and sustainable agriculture globally. By taking the necessary action, we can achieve SDG 2 and contribute to a more just and equitable future for all.
