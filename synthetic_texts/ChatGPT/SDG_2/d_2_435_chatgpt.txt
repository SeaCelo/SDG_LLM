Executive Summary

This report aims to provide an in-depth analysis of Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2): Zero Hunger. As the goal with the highest degree of interdependence with other goals, achieving zero hunger is crucial for sustainable development and a prerequisite for social progress. Oxfam, a trusted global organization focused on addressing poverty and inequality, presents an expert review of the current state of SDG 2, highlighting its key challenges, progress, and recommendations.

Introduction

SDG 2 is centered around ending hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture. It recognizes that providing access to safe, sufficient, and nutritious food for all is vital for eradicating poverty and ensuring equitable and sustainable development.

Challenges

Despite efforts and progress made, the goal of eliminating hunger by 2030 remains substantially at risk. Persistent challenges in achieving food security and nutrition include:

1. Poverty and Inequality: Hunger is significantly rooted in poverty and inequality, as those living in poverty often lack resources to access nutritious food. Expanding inequalities exacerbate these vulnerabilities, with marginalized populations, including women, children, and rural communities, facing disproportionate risks.

2. Climate Change and Environmental Degradation: Climate change poses significant threats to agriculture and food systems. Rising temperatures, extreme weather events, water scarcity, and land degradation jeopardize agricultural yields, food production, and food security. Biodiversity loss further weakens ecosystems required for sustainable and resilient agricultural practices.

3. Conflict, Fragility, and Instability: Conflicts and crises disrupt agriculture and food systems, displacing communities and leading to food insecurity. Countries facing prolonged violence or instability experience significant setbacks in achieving SDG 2, exacerbating hunger and malnutrition.

Progress

Despite these challenges, notable progress has been made towards SDG 2. Over the past decade, global hunger rates have declined, indicating that efforts are yielding results in certain regions. Some positive developments include:

1. Reduction in Extreme Hunger: The number of people facing chronic undernourishment reduced from 948 million in 2000 to 690 million in 2019, yet progress remains insufficiently rapid.

2. Increased Agricultural Productivity: Many countries have achieved improvements in agricultural productivity through innovative technology, sustainable practices, and targeted investments. This has contributed to improved food availability and accessibility.

3. Enhanced Nutrition: Advances in nutrition-focused interventions, such as breastfeeding promotion, micronutrient fortification, and school meal programs, have led to improved nutritional outcomes, particularly for children.

Recommendations

To accelerate progress towards SDG 2 and achieve zero hunger by 2030, Oxfam presents the following recommendations for policymakers, stakeholders, and global institutions:

1. Address Root Causes of Poverty: Tackling hunger necessitates addressing structural issues that perpetuate poverty and inequality. Governments and institutions must prioritize poverty reduction measures, inclusive development policies, and targeted interventions to ensure equitable access to resources and opportunities.

2. Climate Resilient Agriculture: Governments should invest in climate-resilient and sustainable agricultural practices. This may include promoting agroecology, fostering sustainable land management, diversifying crops, and building capacity to mitigate climate risks and adapt to changing conditions.

3. Strengthen Humanitarian Assistance: Efforts to alleviate hunger in conflict and crisis-affected regions must be reinforced. Increasing funding for emergency response, strengthening local food systems, and prioritizing protracted conflict resolution are crucial for a sustainable solution.

4. Mobilize Resources and Improve Governance: International solidarity and commitment are paramount to achieve SDG 2. Developing countries need access to financial resources, technology transfer, and capacity-building support. Simultaneously, ensuring transparent and accountable governance helps in effective implementation and monitoring of policies related to hunger and agriculture.

Conclusion

The way forward in achieving SDG 2 requires concerted efforts, collaboration, and innovation among actors and stakeholders. By addressing the root causes of hunger, amplifying measures against climate change, and strengthening humanitarian response, the world can make significant strides towards a hunger-free world. Oxfam calls upon leaders and experts to prioritize zero hunger, recognizing that it forms the foundation for a just and sustainable future for all.
