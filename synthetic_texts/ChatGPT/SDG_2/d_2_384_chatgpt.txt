The Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG2) aims to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. As the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, I am pleased to present this analytical report that underscores key facets of SDG2 in the context of refugee populations worldwide for the benefit of an expert audience.

Refugees, forcibly displaced individuals fleeing conflict or persecution, face numerous challenges related to accessing food and achieving food security. The global refugee crisis has escalated over the years, with an estimated 26 million refugees worldwide. They experience higher rates of hunger, malnutrition, and food insecurity compared to the general population.

When examining the objectives set by SDG2, it becomes evident that refugees' situation is intricately linked with many of the said targets. For instance, achieving zero hunger among refugees necessitates addressing the root causes of their forced displacement. Conflict is a significant driver of displacement, disrupting agricultural production, market infrastructures, and food systems. Additionally, restrictive policies and limited employment opportunities negatively impact the ability of refugees to obtain a stable income for purchasing food.

Ensuring food security for refugees entails ensuring their access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food at all times. Access to food is a complex issue within the context of refugee settlements and camps. The fluctuating and uncertain availability of aid and unpredictable food aid distributions can lead to inadequate access and heightened vulnerabilities. Protracted refugee situations, where individuals spend prolonged periods in exile, further exacerbate food security concerns.

To address these challenges, there is a need for a comprehensive approach, involving multiple stakeholders, to meet SDG2 targets for the refugee population. First and foremost, the promotion of peace, conflict resolution, and prevention of forced displacement is key in reducing the number of refugees. Addressing the root causes of conflicts and investing in peacebuilding measures can contribute to long-term solutions.

In terms of sustainable agriculture, support should be given to refugees who possess traditional farming knowledge and skills. By providing them with access to arable land, tools, and training, their agricultural productivity can be enhanced. Equipping refugees with sustainable agricultural practices can lead to self-sufficiency, reducing their dependence on external food assistance.

Collaboration between host communities, humanitarian agencies, and non-governmental organizations is crucial for ensuring a comprehensive response to the nutrition needs of refugees. Integrating refugees into national social protection programs, such as cash assistance and voucher schemes, can empower them to make their own food choices, fostering self-reliance while respecting their cultural preferences and diet.

Improving the resilience of refugees to shocks and disasters is another essential aspect of achieving SDG2. Climate change exacerbates food insecurity, particularly for those who rely on rainfed agriculture. Implementing climate-smart agriculture approaches that promote adaptation measures, sustainable land management, and water conservation can build resilience among refugee communities.

Moreover, investing in education and vocational training for refugees enhances their long-term food security prospects. Acquiring skills in agricultural practices, livestock management, and food processing can generate income and create opportunities for self-employment within and beyond the context of refugee settings.

To ensure effective implementation and monitoring of SDG2 targets for refugees, robust data collection systems with disaggregated data on refugee populations are crucial. Such data helps identify and address specific vulnerabilities, track progress, and inform evidence-based policies and interventions.

In conclusion, reaching the SDG2 targets for refugees requires a multi-faceted and comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of forced displacement, promotes sustainable agriculture, ensures access to quality food, and enhances the resilience and self-reliance of refugee populations. By prioritizing the specific challenges faced by refugees and integrating them into national and international development agendas, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and sustainable future for all.
