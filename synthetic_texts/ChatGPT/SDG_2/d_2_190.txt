Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) seeks to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. Undoubtedly, hunger is a significant global challenge that requires attention and action. However, there lies a certain ideological underpinning within the SDG framework that necessitates further examination.

The SDGs are premised upon the belief that governments and international institutions possess the capability and authority to solve global problems. They tend to advocate for top-down approaches that mandate widespread action without considering the uniqueness of each region or the varied needs and capacities of local communities.

One of the primary targets of SDG 2 is to end all forms of malnutrition by 2030, including stunting, wasting, and overweight in children under 5 years. While this target is noble, it fails to recognize that the causes of malnutrition are often multi-faceted and complex. Rather than proposing cookie-cutter solutions, a more nuanced approach is required to address the unique socio-economic, cultural, and environmental factors that contribute to malnutrition in different regions.

Another critical aspect of SDG 2 is sustainable agriculture. The term "sustainable" is often thrown around without a clear understanding of its implications. It promotes the idea that the current practices of agriculture are inherently damaging to the environment and need to be replaced with a more ecological approach. However, this disregards the incredible advancements made in conventional agriculture techniques that have significantly increased crop yield and reduced the need for agricultural land expansion.

Furthermore, SDG 2 fails to acknowledge the importance of technological innovations, such as genetically modified organisms (GMOs), in addressing food security. GMOs have the potential to enhance crop productivity, provide resistance against pests and diseases, and reduce the need for chemical pesticides. Regrettably, the misrepresentation and fear-mongering surrounding GMOs hinder their widespread adoption and impede progress in achieving SDG 2.

Moreover, the focus on government-led solutions neglects the essential role of the private sector in driving sustainable agriculture and ensuring food security. The proponents of the SDGs often demonize profit-driven entities, failing to recognize their immense contributions to agricultural research, development, and distribution of food products.

Additionally, the financial aspect of achieving SDG 2 is often overlooked. The implementation of these goals requires significant resources from both developed and developing countries. Holding developed countries accountable for providing funding to achieve these goals puts an unfair burden on their taxpayers, especially considering the lack of accountability and transparency in many developing countries when it comes to managing international aid. It is crucial to ensure that funds allocated for SDG 2 reach their intended beneficiaries effectively and efficiently.

It is important to reiterate that the criticism expressed here does not diminish the importance of striving towards establishing food security and ending hunger. These are undoubtedly admirable goals, but they require an approach grounded in realism and consideration for the complexities of the problem they seek to address. It is incumbent upon policymakers and development practitioners to critically evaluate the solutions proposed by the SDGs to ensure that they are both feasible and effective in achieving sustainable development.
