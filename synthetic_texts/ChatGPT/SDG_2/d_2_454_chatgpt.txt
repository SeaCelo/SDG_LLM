INTRODUCTION

Women in Europe for a Common Future (WECF) presents this comprehensive analytical report to provide an expert audience with a detailed analysis of Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2): Zero Hunger. As an international network of civil society organizations, WECF is committed to safeguarding women's rights and promoting sustainable development, making us well-positioned to assess progress, identify challenges, and offer recommendations for achieving SDG 2.

OVERVIEW OF SDG 2

SDG 2 aims to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. It addresses the immense challenge of feeding a growing global population adequately, while respecting environmental boundaries. Nonetheless, ensuring food security and promoting sustainable agricultural practices go beyond merely increasing agricultural productivity.

PROGRESS AND CHALLENGES

Significant progress has been made since the adoption of SDG 2. Globally, hunger and undernourishment rates have declined, and many countries have embraced sustainable agriculture practices. Achieving SDG 2, however, has encountered various challenges.

1. Agricultural Sector Sustainability: While progress has been made in sustainable agriculture, further efforts are required to make practices more widespread and transformative. It is crucial to address the environmental impacts of conventional agriculture, such as pesticides and monocultures, and encourage agroecology, organic farming, and regenerative practices.

2. Gender Dimension: Gender equality is intrinsically linked to achieving SDG 2. However, women and girls, particularly in marginalized communities, face multiple barriers that hinder their participation and decision-making power in the agricultural sector. Ensuring their equal access to resources and their rights to land, water, and financial services are essential to tackle hunger.

3. Climate Change: Climate change poses a grave threat to food security and agriculture. Erratic weather patterns, increased pests, and the degradation of natural resources escalate vulnerability, especially in developing countries. Combating climate change through resilient agricultural practices and reducing greenhouse gas emissions is crucial.

4. Inequality and Conflict: Inequalities, existing power structures, armed conflicts, and displacement have severe implications for SDG 2. Efforts to address food security must prioritize vulnerable and marginalized groups, including small-scale farmers, rural communities, indigenous peoples, and refugees.

RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Invest in Sustainable Agriculture: Governments and international institutions should allocate adequate financial resources to support the transition to sustainable agriculture practices. This includes promoting agroecological techniques, crop rotation, and the preservation of biodiversity.

2. Strengthen Women's Empowerment: Policies and programs must consider the gender dimensions of food security and agriculture. Eliminating discriminatory laws, ensuring land rights for women, and enhancing access to education, training, and credits are vital for promoting gender equality in the sector.

3. Enhance Climate Resilience: Parties to the Paris Agreement should prioritize climate-smart agriculture and implement comprehensive adaptation measures. Supporting small-scale farmers with access to weather information, drought-resistant seeds, and climate insurance would strengthen their resilience.

4. Improve Data Collection: Accurate and disaggregated data is fundamental for monitoring progress. Governments should establish robust mechanisms to collect data on hunger, food production, and nutrition. Promoting international collaboration on data sharing would enhance transparency and accountability.

5. Strengthen International Cooperation: Strengthening multilateral partnerships is crucial. Governments, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders must collaborate to exchange knowledge, transfer sustainable practices, and promote capacity-building in food security and sustainable agriculture.

CONCLUSION

Achieving SDG 2: Zero Hunger is both a critical goal in its own right and essential for the overall well-being of individuals and the planet. Progress has been made, but it is imperative to address the challenges outlined in this report. By investing in sustainable agriculture, empowering women, combating climate change, tackling inequality, and enhancing international cooperation, we can strive towards a future free from hunger, promoting a healthy and sustainable planet for all.
