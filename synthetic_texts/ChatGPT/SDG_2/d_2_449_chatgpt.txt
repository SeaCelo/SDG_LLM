INTRODUCTION

This analytical report aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) - Zero Hunger, as set by the United Nations General Assembly, from the standpoint of international charity organization Tearfund. Undertaking a holistic approach, this report will explore the different dimensions of SDG 2, highlighting the progress made, the existing challenges, and potential strategies for improvement. It is intended for an expert audience seeking an insightful analysis of the current state of SDG 2 implementation.

ANALYSIS

SDG 2 seeks to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture by the year 2030. Hunger remains a critical global issue with significant implications for poverty, health, and overall human development. Tearfund recognizes the urgent need to eradicate hunger and touches the lives of communities worldwide, especially those facing extreme hunger and malnutrition.

Over the past decades, concerted efforts have been made by governments, NGOs, and international organizations to address hunger and food insecurity. However, despite some progress, the global picture is far from satisfactory. According to a report by the United Nations, the number of undernourished people rose to an estimated 815 million in 2016, marking an increase from 777 million in 2015. Further analysis reveals the uneven distribution of food security, with Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia being severely affected.

One of the major challenges in achieving SDG 2 is the increasing vulnerability of food systems to various factors, including climate change, conflicts, and economic inequalities. Climate change disrupts agricultural productivity, alters rainfall patterns, and intensifies extreme weather events, all of which significantly impact food security. Tearfund understands the complexities of achieving food security in the face of climate change and highlights the importance of building resilient agricultural systems that can withstand climate shocks.

Moreover, armed conflicts and fragile governance structures disrupt agricultural practices and limit access to essential resources, exacerbating food insecurity. Tearfund recognizes the significance of peacebuilding efforts and social cohesion in addressing the root causes of hunger and ensuring sustainable food production and distribution.

Inequities in power and resources, both within and between nations, further perpetuate food insecurity. Large-scale land acquisitions and inadequate access to markets and technology often hinder small-scale farmers from thriving, perpetuating poverty and hunger. Tearfund emphasizes the need for policy interventions that empower smallholder farmers, enhance market value chains, and promote equitable distribution of resources.

Achieving SDG 2 calls for innovations and participatory approaches that tap into the potential of new technologies, sustainable agricultural practices, and agricultural diversification. By investing in agroecological approaches, promoting smart farming methods, and adapting suitable climate-resilient crop varieties, communities can enhance their productivity, reduce environmental impacts, and improve livelihoods. Tearfund advocates for public-private partnerships and knowledge sharing platforms to promote the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices at scale.

Nevertheless, addressing SDG 2 alone is insufficient. Addressing hunger necessitates synergies with other interconnected SDGs, such as poverty eradication, clean water and sanitation, gender equality, and climate action. Tearfund understands the importance of cross-sectoral collaboration and integrated approaches to achieve meaningful and sustainable progress in SDG 2.

CONCLUSION

Despite the global commitment to ending hunger, the current progress in achieving SDG 2 is inadequate. Tearfund emphasizes the need for renewed energy and focus to accelerate efforts to address the root causes of hunger, promote sustainable agriculture, and ensure access to nutritious food for all. It is imperative for all stakeholders, ranging from national governments to international organizations, to enhance collaboration, promote policy coherence, and tackle the complex challenges of climate change, conflicts, and inequalities. As an expert audience, investing in sustainable and innovative approaches and adopting a holistic approach based on the analysis provided in this report will contribute to achieving Zero Hunger and creating a more food-secure future for all.
