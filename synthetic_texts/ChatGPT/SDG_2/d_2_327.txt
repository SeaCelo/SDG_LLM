Executive Summary

This detailed analytical report provides an overview of Israel's efforts towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) â€“ Zero Hunger. As an Agency for International Development Cooperation, Israel recognizes the importance of food security and nutrition in promoting sustainable development globally. This report aims to showcase the initiatives, partnerships, and lessons learned by Israel in advancing agricultural productivity, food security, and nutritious food access.

1. Introduction
SDG 2 highlights the need to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. Food security remains a pressing global challenge, compounded by factors such as population growth, climate change, and socioeconomic inequalities. Recognizing this, Israel has taken significant strides to address these issues and contribute to both global and national objectives.

2. Advocacy and Policies
Israel's dedicated agency, the MASHAV - Israel's Agency for International Development Cooperation, actively advocates for the importance of addressing global hunger. It engages diplomatically to raise awareness of food security and nutrition, promoting effective policies and interventions in international forums. The agency collaborates with stakeholders, including governments, international institutions, and local organizations, to encourage collective action.

3. Innovation in Agriculture
Israel is globally renowned for its expertise in agricultural innovation, particularly in water-efficient techniques, desert agriculture, and precision farming. These practices aim to increase agricultural productivity, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. By providing training and sharing best practices, Israel supports capacity development in partner countries, empowering them to sustainably improve their agricultural practices.

4. Technology Transfer and Capacity Building
Through MASHAV, Israel provides technical assistance and knowledge exchange programs, utilizing the country's advanced agricultural technologies. These initiatives focus on capacitating farmers, extension workers, and policy-makers, enhancing their skills and abilities to adopt efficient and sustainable agricultural practices. Capacity building programs cover subjects like irrigation, post-harvest management, crop protection, and farm management.

5. Enhanced Cooperation
MASHAV establishes bilateral and multilateral partnerships, facilitating collaboration among countries facing similar agricultural challenges. Israel cooperates with various governmental and non-governmental actors to conduct joint research, develop shared solutions, and build networks to address food security. This collaboration fosters the exchange of knowledge, technologies, and innovations for sustainable agriculture.

6. Innovations in Nutrition
Israel has made significant advancements in nutrition research and interventions, particularly in areas like food fortification and agricultural biofortification. Through public-private partnerships, Israel actively promotes biofortification techniques to increase the nutritional value of staple crops, mitigating micronutrient deficiencies. Such innovations contribute to achieving SDG 2's target of ending malnutrition.

7. Strengthened Food Systems
Recognizing the importance of sound food systems, Israel focuses on improving the entire food value chain. Engaging stakeholders along the value chain, including farmers, agribusinesses, and consumers, Israel seeks to develop inclusive, efficient, and sustainable food systems. This approach supports economic growth, poverty reduction, and equitable access to nutritious food.

8. Irrigation Technologies and Water Management
Israel is world-renowned for its advanced irrigation technologies and water management practices. Given the significance of water scarcity in sustainable agriculture, Israel shares its expertise and technologies in irrigation management, water recycling, and precision agriculture with partner countries. These efforts contribute to increased agricultural productivity and water use efficiency, promoting resilience to climate change.

9. Improved Agricultural Resilience
Climate change presents a growing threat to global food security. Israel prioritizes research and development initiatives that enhance agricultural resilience to climate change, including drought-tolerant crop varieties, pest and disease management, and adaptive farming practices. In collaboration with partner countries, Israel aims to build community resilience and adaptive capacities to climate-related challenges.

10. Monitoring and Evaluation
Israel recognizes the importance of robust monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to assess the impact of its interventions. Regular assessments and evaluations help identify best practices, areas for improvement, and lessons learned, enabling evidence-based decision-making and continuous improvement in addressing SDG 2.

Conclusion
Israel strives to fulfill SDG 2 targets by leveraging its technological expertise, development programs, innovative research, and inclusive partnerships, aligning efforts towards a hunger-free world. Through MASHAV, Israel actively contributes to global food security and the development of sustainable agricultural practices. However, the road to achieving SDG 2 requires continuous collaboration, resource mobilization, and sharing of knowledge and best practices at both national and global levels.
