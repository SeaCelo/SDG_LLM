Asli Demirguc-Kunt is an esteemed economist and former Chief Economist of the World Bank. Throughout her distinguished career, she has conducted extensive research on issues related to sustainable development, including the interaction between financial development and poverty reduction. Drawing upon her expertise, this article will provide a comprehensive analysis of Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger.

At its core, SDG 2 aims to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. It recognizes that hunger not only reflects a lack of food but also a broader challenge of accessibility, affordability, nutrition, and sustainability. By 2030, the intention is to ensure that everyone, everywhere has access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food all year round.

The scope and ambition of SDG 2 reflect the magnitude of the problem it seeks to address. According to the United Nations, over 820 million people suffer from hunger worldwide, with acute food insecurity being a preeminent concern in many conflict-affected areas and regions plagued by climate shocks. At the same time, nutritional challenges such as malnutrition, stunted growth, and obesity remain prevalent, affecting both low-income and high-income countries.

To tackle these complex issues comprehensively, SDG 2 presents three main targets. The first is to end hunger and ensure access by all people, in particular, the vulnerable, to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food by 2030. This recognizes the importance of not only eradicating hunger but also designing inclusive policies and programs that ensure equitable access to nutritious food for all segments of society.

The second target is to improve agricultural productivity and the incomes of small-scale farmers, thereby enhancing sustainable food production systems. This recognizes the crucial role of agriculture in food security, particularly in rural areas where a significant proportion of people depend on farming for their livelihoods. Sustainable agricultural practices, such as agroecology, organic farming, and climate-smart agriculture, are essential to promote resilient, productive, and environmentally friendly food systems.

The third target aims to address malnutrition in all its forms by ensuring access to safe and diversified nutritious food and eliminating micronutrient deficiencies. This target acknowledges that malnutrition is not only a problem of quantity but also quality. It underlines the importance of a balanced diet and proper nutrition for overall health, cognitive development, and economic productivity.

To achieve these targets, SDG 2 requires the collaborative efforts of governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector. Policy interventions must address the root causes of hunger and malnutrition, such as poverty, inequality, conflicts, and climate change. By investing in social protection systems, vulnerable populations can be shielded from the adverse impacts of shocks, enabling them to access food in times of crisis.

Innovation and technology play a vital role in advancing sustainable agriculture and ending hunger. Developing and disseminating appropriate technologies enhances agricultural productivity, reduces post-harvest losses, promotes efficient resource use, and boosts the resilience of farming communities. Moreover, digital solutions, such as e-agriculture, can improve access to market information, finance, and agricultural extension services for small-scale farmers.

Policymakers should also focus on creating an enabling environment for sustainable agricultural practices. This involves promoting land rights, sustainable land use, and reducing the environmental footprint of agriculture through sustainable water management, waste reduction, and protection of biodiversity. Investment in infrastructure, particularly rural infrastructure, is crucial for boosting agricultural productivity and improving market access.

Sustained international cooperation and partnerships are vital for the success of SDG 2. Developed countries must honor their commitment to provide financial resources, technology transfer, and capacity building support to developing countries. Strengthening international trade in agriculture and reducing trade barriers are crucial for promoting sustainable food systems and ensuring that small-scale farmers can access global markets.

In conclusion, SDG 2 embodies the global commitment to eliminate hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. Its multi-dimensional nature necessitates a holistic approach, addressing issues of availability, accessibility, affordability, nutrition, and sustainability. Only through concerted efforts, global cooperation, and innovation can we build a world where no one goes to bed hungry, and everyone can lead a healthy and productive life.
