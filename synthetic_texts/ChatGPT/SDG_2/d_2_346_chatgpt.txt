The Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID) has undertaken a comprehensive analysis of the current state of Sustainable Development Goal 2. SDG 2 aims to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030. This report provides a deep analysis of the progress made towards meeting this goal, with a particular focus on the Spanish approach. It aims to engage a expert audience and provide them with an in-depth understanding of the challenges faced and the opportunities to make significant advancements in achieving SDG 2.

Since the adoption of SDG 2, considerable progress has been made globally, but challenges persist. According to the latest available data, global hunger has been steadily rising in recent years, with an estimated 820 million people experiencing chronic food insecurity in 2018. This signifies a significant setback as the world veers off track from the target of ending hunger by 2030. However, Spain, through the AECID, has taken several steps to contribute to achieving SDG 2 both domestically and internationally.

Spain recognizes that addressing hunger and malnutrition is crucial for achieving sustainable development, and has embraced a multi-sectoral approach to tackle these complex issues. Domestically, Spain has made strides in enhancing food security by implementing policies aimed at supporting small-scale farmers, promoting sustainable agricultural practices, and ensuring access to nutritious food for vulnerable populations. The country has contributed to establishing a framework conducive to eradicating food insecurity within its borders.

Internationally, Spanish development programs, supported by the AECID, have been directed towards achieving food security on a global scale. Spanish initiatives have focused on capacity building in agriculture, promoting sustainable farming practices, enhancing rural livelihoods, and supporting small-scale farmers in partner countries. The Spanish government has emphasized collaboration with regional and international organizations, including the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP), to strengthen international efforts aimed at achieving SDG 2.

However, the report also highlights the existing challenges in achieving SDG 2. One of the key challenges is the impact of climate change on global food security. Increasingly frequent extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods, disrupt agricultural production and threaten the livelihoods of smallholder farmers, exacerbating food insecurity. Spain recognizes the urgent need for climate-resilient agriculture and is actively engaging in projects aimed at adapting farming systems and promoting climate-smart agricultural practices.

Gender equality is another issue that warrants significant attention in the context of SDG 2. Women, who often play a vital role in agriculture and food production, face numerous barriers that hinder their access to productive resources and economic opportunities. Spain, through the AECID, emphasizes gender mainstreaming in its development programs to address these disparities and empower women in the agricultural sector.

Moreover, it is evident that achieving SDG 2 requires substantial financial resources. Spain, as a member of the international community, has committed to supporting the achievement of SDG 2 by increasing Official Development Assistance (ODA). Encouragingly, Spain has maintained its ODA commitment and is working towards the internationally agreed target of dedicating 0.7% of gross national income to ODA.

As expert readers in the field, it is vital to recognize that achieving SDG 2 demands an integrated and holistic approach that goes beyond addressing hunger and malnutrition alone. It requires systemic and sustainable solutions that account for diverse factors, including social, economic, and environmental dimensions, while promoting partnerships and global cooperation.

In conclusion, the analysis presented in this report demonstrates Spain's commitment to the achievement of SDG 2 and the considerable efforts made to address the challenges and seize the opportunities in ensuring food security, promoting sustainable agriculture, and ending hunger. By embracing a multi-stakeholder approach, enhancing international collaboration, promoting climate-smart agricultural practices, empowering women, and dedicating resources, Spain has taken significant strides towards the realization of SDG 2. Continuous efforts, adaptation, and innovation will be paramount in advancing the agenda further and making substantial progress towards a world free from hunger and malnutrition.
