SDG 2: No Hunger

Introduction:
This report provides a detailed analysis of Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) focusing on its current status, challenges, and potential solutions. The goal of SDG 2 is to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030. As an international organization committed to advancing children's rights and equality for girls, Plan International strongly supports this goal. In this report, we will assess the progress made so far in achieving SDG 2, identify key challenges, and propose recommendations for accelerating its realization.

Progress:
Significant progress has been made towards achieving SDG 2 since its adoption in 2015. As of now, the prevalence of hunger has been reduced, but to fully achieve the goal, more effective efforts are urgently needed. Latest statistical data indicates that the global number of undernourished people has decreased from 804 million in 2011-2013 to 690 million in 2019. Nonetheless, the COVID-19 pandemic threatens to reverse much of this progress, as it exacerbates poverty, food insecurity, and malnutrition.

Challenges:
One of the major challenges in achieving SDG 2 is ensuring access to nutritious food for all. Malnutrition is a critical issue affecting millions of children around the world, leading to stunted growth, cognitive impairments, and increased susceptibility to diseases. Poverty remains a significant barrier to ending hunger, as many households lack the financial means to afford a balanced diet. Meanwhile, climate change poses a serious threat to agricultural productivity, making it even more challenging to achieve food security.

Another key challenge is the persistence of gender inequalities and discriminatory social norms that further exacerbate food insecurity. In many communities, women and girls have limited access to resources and decision-making power, hindering their ability to address hunger effectively. Their participation and empowerment are crucial for sustainable agriculture and food production.

Recommendations:
To accelerate progress towards SDG 2, it is crucial to adopt a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach. Here are some key recommendations based on Plan International's expertise and learnings:

1. Strengthen social protection systems: Governments should invest in social safety nets and targeted policies designed to eradicate extreme poverty and ensure access to food for vulnerable populations, particularly in times of crisis. Such systems should prioritize women and girls, who often bear the brunt of hunger.

2. Invest in sustainable agriculture: Enhancing agricultural productivity while minimizing environmental impact is vital. Governments and international organizations should invest in innovative and climate-smart farming practices, promoting agroecology, integrating indigenous knowledge, and supporting small-scale farmers, especially women-led enterprises.

3. Promote gender equality: It is crucial to remove the gender-based barriers that prevent girls and women from fully participating in food production, decision-making, and agricultural innovation. Governments and organizations should prioritize measures that promote gender equality, empower women and girls, and ensure their access to productive resources and opportunities.

4. Strengthen international cooperation: Global collaboration is essential in addressing the complex challenges posed by hunger and food insecurity. Governments, civil society organizations, and international bodies should work together to mobilize resources, share knowledge, and develop joint strategies to achieve SDG 2 by 2030.

Conclusion:
While progress has been made towards ending hunger as outlined in SDG 2, urgent action is needed to overcome the challenges that persist. Sustainable agriculture, social protection systems, gender equality, and international cooperation stand as critical pillars in our efforts to achieve SDG 2. Plan International remains committed to supporting and advocating for the implementation of sustainable solutions that prioritize the rights of children, with a particular emphasis on girls and ensuring no one is left behind in our collective pursuit for a world free from hunger and malnutrition.
