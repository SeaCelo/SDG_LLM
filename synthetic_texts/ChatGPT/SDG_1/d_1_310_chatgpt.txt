Dear esteemed audience,

We present to you a comprehensive analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1 - Ending Poverty. As representatives of the Azerbaijan International Development Agency, we have closely examined the current status of poverty eradication efforts within Azerbaijan and the potential for achieving this goal. Our report aims to provide you with a deep understanding of the challenges and successes thus far, while also highlighting key recommendations for future action.

Azerbaijan, being a lower-middle-income country, has made significant progress in reducing poverty rates over the past two decades. However, there are still various regional and social disparities that exist within the country, posing obstacles to achieving SDG 1 by 2030. Indigenous minorities, rural populations, and internally displaced persons are particularly vulnerable groups that require targeted interventions to uplift them from poverty.

To comprehend the extent of poverty in Azerbaijan, it is crucial to assess its multidimensional nature. Traditional poverty indicators, such as income levels and living standards, must be analyzed alongside non-monetary aspects such as access to quality education, healthcare, clean water, and sanitation. This multidimensional approach ensures that no one is left behind, aligning with the core principle of the Sustainable Development Goals.

Currently, the national poverty rate stands at 4.5%, a testament to the success of government policies prioritizing poverty alleviation. In addition to income-based interventions, the government has adopted a rights-based approach, placing great emphasis on social protection programs. The introduction of the targeted social assistance scheme, implemented since 2006, has played a vital role in minimizing extreme poverty and ensuring vulnerable populations receive the necessary support.

Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic has presented new challenges to poverty eradication efforts across the globe, and Azerbaijan is no exception. The pandemic has disrupted economic growth, reduced job opportunities, exacerbated inequalities, and increased food insecurity. To mitigate these adverse effects, the government swiftly implemented a series of emergency measures, including financial assistance, job retention programs, and the establishment of quarantine and healthcare infrastructure. These actions demonstrate national commitment and agility in addressing the new dimensions of poverty arising from the pandemic.

Moving forward, there are several areas where Azerbaijan has the potential to enhance its efforts to eradicate poverty sustainably. Firstly, there is a need to strengthen social protection programs, particularly in rural areas and regions with a higher incidence of poverty. A comprehensive review and update of the current social welfare system would ensure that the most marginalized groups receive adequate support and encouragement to participate in the socio-economic development of the country.

Secondly, investment in education and skills development programs is paramount for breaking the cycle of poverty. Enhancing the quality of education, providing vocational training opportunities, and promoting lifelong learning would equip individuals with the necessary tools for secure employment and in turn, empower them to lift themselves out of poverty.

Additionally, to improve agricultural productivity and address rural poverty, a strong focus should be placed on promoting sustainable and climate-resilient farming practices. Encouraging small-scale farming technologies, supporting farmers' cooperatives, and investing in agricultural research and development would not only increase food security but also create livelihood opportunities in the agricultural sector.

Furthermore, effective public-private partnerships hold great potential for poverty reduction. Fostering collaboration between the government, civil society organizations, and the private sector would facilitate innovative approaches, resource mobilization, and knowledge exchange, leading to more sustainable and inclusive development.

In conclusion, Azerbaijan has shown commendable progress in poverty reduction, yet challenges to achieving SDG 1 remain prominent. Aligning our approaches with the principles of the Sustainable Development Goals, strengthening social protection programs, investing in education and skills development, promoting sustainable agricultural practices, and fostering effective partnerships are crucial steps toward the goal of eradicating poverty by 2030. The Azerbaijan International Development Agency stands ready to collaborate with stakeholders, both domestically and internationally, to accelerate progress and ensure a prosperous future for all.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,
