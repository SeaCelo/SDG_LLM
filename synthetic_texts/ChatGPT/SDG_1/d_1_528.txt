Introduction:
Sustainable development rests upon the firm belief that economic growth should be inclusive and must improve people's lives while reducing inequality and poverty. In this realm, Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1): No Poverty, assumes a paramount importance. This article endeavors to provide an extensive analysis of the legal and economic dimensions of SDG 1.

Legal Frameworks:
Legally combating poverty necessitates a robust framework in place that addresses both immediate needs and long-term endeavors. National and international legal instruments, such as constitutional provisions, laws, and human rights conventions, play a pivotal role in fighting poverty. The article elucidates the role of these legal frameworks in safeguarding the interests of vulnerable populations.

Poverty Alleviation Strategies:
Economic approaches form an essential aspect of addressing poverty. Governments worldwide deploy a range of strategies to tackle poverty and promote sustainable development. Here, the article examines key economic policies, including social protection mechanisms, income distribution programs, labor regulations, and entrepreneurship initiatives. Harnessing both macro- and micro-level economic interventions, it delves into their enabling factors and emphatically points out the convergence between law and economics in attaining SDG 1.

Prosperity in Fragile States:
The article explores the complexities associated with poverty eradication in fragile states and how legal and economic frameworks should be uniquely tailored for such nations. Given the challenges posed by conflict, limited resources, and political instability, this section highlights the significance of international law, foreign aid, and transitional justice mechanisms in ensuring poverty reduction during state-building processes.

Regional Case Studies:
To provide a comparative analysis, the article delves into various regional strategies employed to address poverty. By examining cases from diverse regions such as Africa, Latin America, and Asia, critical insights are drawn in identifying successful policies, legal frameworks, and economic interventions for poverty eradication. The analysis includes discussions on inclusive growth models, land tenure reforms, social welfare programs, and the role of international cooperation in achieving desired outcomes.

Public-Private Partnerships:
International cooperation is a crucial driver for poverty eradication. Collaborative partnerships between governments, private enterprises, civil society, and academia accelerate progress and innovation towards SDG 1. This article assesses the role of public-private partnerships in implementing successful poverty reduction initiatives, considering both legal and economic mechanisms for effective results. Regional and global mechanisms like the United Nations' Development Partnerships Framework and the World Bank's International Finance Corporation provide further illustrations of such partnerships.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, SDG 1: No Poverty necessitates a comprehensive integration of legal and economic frameworks to enhance poverty reduction efforts. This article has explored the vibrant interplay between law and economics in achieving sustainable development, emphasizing the importance of legal frameworks, poverty alleviation strategies, customized interventions for fragile states, regional case studies, and the significance of public-private partnerships. As this article participates in the discourse surrounding SDG 1, we hope it resonates with policymakers, lawmakers, and researchers working towards a future where poverty is vanquished, global inequality is diminished, and sustainable development is achieved.
