Introduction:
This analytical report provides a comprehensive analysis of Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1), which focuses on eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions. The report, developed by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), targets an expert audience with the aim of deepening their understanding of the current state of SDG 1 and identifying key challenges and opportunities.

Overview of SDG 1:
SDG 1 recognizes that poverty is a complex multidimensional issue that goes beyond income and material deprivation. It aims to ensure that all individuals worldwide have access to basic necessities such as food, clean water, sanitation, education, and healthcare. The goal of eradicating poverty is ambitious, yet necessary to create a sustainable and inclusive society.

Global Progress:
Despite ongoing challenges, progress has been made on SDG 1 globally. The prevalence of extreme poverty (earning less than $1.90 per day) has declined significantly over the past few decades. Between 1990 and 2015, the global poverty rate dropped from 36% to 10%. However, progress has been uneven, with significant disparities observed between regions, countries, and population groups.

Regional Analysis:
In assessing regional progress, it is important to acknowledge the varying contexts and challenges faced. In Sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, extreme poverty remains high, affecting approximately 39% of the population. In contrast, East Asia and the Pacific have experienced impressive poverty reduction, with the prevalence dropping from 60% to 3% between 1990 and 2015.

Deep Dive into Linkages:
In order to address the multidimensional nature of poverty, SDG 1 emphasizes the importance of strengthening social protection systems, promoting inclusive economic growth, achieving full employment, enhancing access to quality education, and improving healthcare services. These linkages between SDG 1 and other goals demonstrate the interconnectedness of the sustainable development agenda.

Challenges and Opportunities:
A holistic approach is crucial in tackling poverty eradication. Challenges persist, such as increasing inequality within and between countries, lack of access to productive resources, the negative impacts of climate change, and disruptions caused by conflicts and disasters. However, these challenges also provide opportunities for innovative strategies and partnerships.

Innovative Approaches:
Several innovative approaches to supporting SDG 1 have emerged. Microfinance institutions, for example, have proved effective in providing small loans and financial services to low-income households, enabling them to establish sustainable livelihoods and build resilience. Digital technologies, mobile banking, and cash transfer programs have also played a significant role in expanding financial inclusion and reducing poverty.

Partnerships and Cooperation:
Achieving SDG 1 requires strong partnerships and cooperation at local, national, and international levels. The SDC is actively engaged in supporting SDG 1 through various channels, including financial assistance, technical expertise, knowledge sharing, and capacity building. The agency works closely with governments, civil society organizations, academia, and the private sector to ensure a coordinated and collaborative approach.

Conclusion:
While progress is being made in the global efforts to reduce poverty, this analytical report highlights the imperative to accelerate action towards achieving SDG 1. The eradication of poverty is not only a moral and ethical obligation but also a prerequisite for achieving other development goals. By addressing the multidimensional aspects of poverty, leveraging innovative approaches, fostering partnerships, and promoting inclusive economic growth, we can work towards a world free from poverty, ensuring a sustainable, just, and prosperous future for all.
