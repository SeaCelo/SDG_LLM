In recent years, the focus on addressing poverty and promoting inclusive economic growth has gained significant traction. As a response to this global agenda, the United Nations introduced the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015 to outline a comprehensive set of targets for sustainable development. This article aims to examine SDG 1, which focuses on ending poverty in all its forms and dimensions by 2030, from the perspective of experimental economics.

Experimental economics is a field of study that uses controlled experiments to gain insight into human behavior and decision-making in economic matters. This approach provides a unique lens through which we can analyze the dynamics of poverty and effective strategies to combat it. By employing laboratory-based experiments, scholars can test various policy interventions, examine causal mechanisms, and uncover hidden insights that traditional methods often fail to capture.

One of the major challenges associated with eradicating poverty is understanding its multidimensional nature. Poverty not only manifests as a lack of income but also encompasses various social, political, and geographical factors. Experimental economics allows researchers to design experiments that simulate real-world scenarios encompassing these diverse dimensions of poverty. By manipulating key variables and parameters, researchers can identify the nuanced relationships between different factors and design targeted interventions.

One experimental approach in understanding poverty dynamics is through the concept of social capital. SDG 1 emphasizes the need to build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations. Experimental economics channels efforts to explore how social networks and community-level interventions can be leveraged to reduce poverty. Controlled experiments can shed light on the effects of implementing strategies such as microcredit schemes, entrepreneurship training, or facilitating access to social networks on poverty alleviation.

Further, experimental economics can help in identifying effective policies to address the spatial inequality in poverty and promote sustainable urbanization - a key aspect of SDG 1. By examining the impact of different policy interventions, experiments can provide policymakers with valuable insights about the most efficient allocation of resources and infrastructure that can drive economic growth in urban areas, while ensuring greater inclusivity.

Besides, experimental economics can inform policymakers on poverty traps and welfare programs. Poverty traps occur when individuals or communities remain stuck in poverty due to various constraints or systemic issues. Experimental studies can elucidate key behavioral bottlenecks and externalities that often perpetuate poverty traps. By investigating policy measures that break the cycle of poverty, experiments can provide evidence-based recommendations to guide policymakers in designing welfare programs and incentive systems to facilitate sustainable development.

In addition to these contributions, experimental economics can also weigh in on the trade-offs associated with poverty alleviation policies and the cost-effectiveness of different interventions. By simulating decision contexts and manipulating policy parameters, experimental studies can estimate the specific costs and benefits of various poverty-reduction initiatives. This information is crucial for decision-makers to make informed choices regarding resource allocation and prioritize actions that maximize social welfare within limited budgets.

To conclude, SDG 1's ambition to end poverty in all its dimensions is a formidable task. However, through the lens of experimental economics, it is possible to gain invaluable insights into the mechanisms that drive poverty and potential solutions to overcome it. Employing controlled experiments, this field of study offers a dynamic approach to unraveling complex poverty dynamics, informing evidence-based policymaking, and facilitating the achievement of SDG 1's targets by 2030. By embracing a multidimensional and experimental paradigm, societies can work towards a more inclusive and sustainable future for all.
