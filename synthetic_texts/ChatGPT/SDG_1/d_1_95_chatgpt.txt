Introduction:

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations in 2015 are a set of 17 ambitious goals aimed at addressing the world's most pressing social, economic, and environmental challenges. SDG 1, in particular, focuses on eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions by 2030. In this article, we will delve into the intricacies of SDG 1 from the perspective of Soli Sorabjee, an esteemed jurist and advocate known for his unwavering commitment to social justice.

Understanding the complexity of poverty:

Soli Sorabjee understands that poverty is a multidimensional issue that goes beyond the absence of income or material wealth. Poverty encompasses the lack of access to basic necessities such as education, healthcare, housing, and employment opportunities. In order to effectively address poverty, he believes that we must adopt an integrated approach that encompasses economic, social, and political dimensions.

Economic empowerment as a driving force:

Economic empowerment, according to Sorabjee, is a precondition for lifting people out of poverty. Increasing income levels and providing sustainable livelihood opportunities is crucial in offering individuals the means to meet their basic needs. This can be achieved through policies aimed at promoting inclusive growth, reducing income inequality, and encouraging entrepreneurship. Sorabjee emphasizes the need for fair trade practices, access to finance, and investment in infrastructure to foster economic growth and create employment opportunities.

A focus on social protection:

Acknowledging the vulnerability of marginalized individuals and communities, Soli Sorabjee highlights the importance of social protection policies in mitigating the impact of poverty. These policies serve as a safety net, providing a basic level of support to those in need. He advocates for the establishment of comprehensive social protection systems that include social security, healthcare, education, and nutrition programs. Soli believes that social protection not only alleviates poverty but also contributes to enhancing human capabilities, promoting social inclusion, and fostering resilience.

Education as the key:

Soli Sorabjee firmly believes that education plays a pivotal role in poverty eradication. According to him, access to quality education is an essential tool for empowerment and social mobility. It equips individuals with knowledge and skills that enable them to break the cycle of poverty and contribute to overall development. Ensuring universal access to free, equitable, and quality education, especially for those in marginalized communities, is therefore crucial to achieving SDG 1.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, Soli Sorabjeeâ€™s perspective on SDG 1 emphasizes the need for a comprehensive and integrated approach to poverty eradication. Economic empowerment, social protection, and access to quality education are all interconnected components of this approach. By focusing on these key aspects, we can address poverty in all its dimensions and work towards a more just and equitable society. SDG 1 provides a guiding framework for action, and it is incumbent on individuals, governments, and organizations to actively contribute towards its achievement. Soli Sorabjee reminds us that by working collectively, we have the power to alleviate poverty and create a sustainable future for all.
