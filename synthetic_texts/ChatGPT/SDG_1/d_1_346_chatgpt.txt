The Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID) is pleased to present this detailed analytical report on SDG 1: No Poverty. As an expert audience, we recognize your deep knowledge and expertise in the field of sustainable development. Therefore, this report aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current situation of SDG 1, focusing on its progress, challenges, and potential solutions.

The eradication of extreme poverty remains one of the most critical goals for the international community. SDG 1 was established with the objective of ending poverty in all its forms everywhere, ensuring that every individual can access basic necessities such as food, shelter, education, and healthcare. While significant progress has been made in lifting millions out of extreme poverty, substantial challenges still persist.

The report will begin by examining the current state of poverty around the world. According to the latest data from the World Bank, approximately 735 million people, or 9.2% of the global population, lived in extreme poverty in 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated this issue, pushing an additional 88-115 million people into extreme poverty in 2020. The impact of this crisis on the world's most vulnerable populations cannot be overstated.

To understand the progress toward SDG 1, it is crucial to assess the effectiveness of national and international policies aimed at reducing poverty. Our analysis reveals that countries have taken various approaches to tackle poverty, with some implementing social protection measures such as cash transfer programs and universal basic income initiatives. Others have focused on strengthening education and healthcare systems, empowering communities, and promoting inclusive economic growth. These measures have proven successful in certain contexts, leading to poverty reduction and improved living conditions for millions.

However, despite the positive outcomes observed in some regions, several challenges hinder the achievement of SDG 1. First and foremost, income inequality remains a significant obstacle in poverty eradication efforts. The gap between the wealthiest and the poorest is widening in many countries, leading to social unrest and marginalized communities. Additionally, gender disparities continue to perpetuate poverty, with women and girls disproportionally affected due to limited access to resources and opportunities.

Furthermore, the adverse impacts of climate change pose a severe threat to poverty reduction. Vulnerable communities, often the most economically disadvantaged, are disproportionately affected by extreme weather events, environmental degradation, and natural disasters. These events not only disrupt livelihoods and hinder economic development but also exacerbate existing poverty and undermine efforts to eradicate it.

In order to overcome these challenges, it is imperative to take a multi-dimensional and integrated approach that addresses the root causes of poverty. Strengthening social protection systems, investing in education and healthcare, promoting gender equality, and enhancing the resilience of communities are essential pillars for poverty reduction. Additionally, greater international cooperation, knowledge sharing, and capacity building are crucial to supporting countries in achieving their poverty reduction objectives.

In conclusion, SDG 1 serves as a reminder of the urgent need to eliminate poverty in all its forms. While significant progress has been made, considerable challenges persist. Addressing income inequality, gender disparities, and the impacts of climate change are key to ensuring the successful realization of SDG 1. International collaboration and tailored approaches that consider the specific contexts of countries will be crucial in accelerating poverty eradication efforts globally. As experts in the field, it is incumbent upon us to leverage our knowledge and resources to support the achievement of SDG 1 and create a world where no one is left behind.
