Camões Instituto da Cooperação e da Língua

Introduction
Poverty remains one of the most pressing social issues across the globe. The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1, also known as "No Poverty," aims to end poverty in all its forms and dimensions by 2030. This comprehensive analytical report examines the current status, challenges, and progress made in achieving SDG 1, considering its implications on a global scale.

Understanding Poverty
To fully comprehend the magnitude of the SDG 1, it is imperative to define and understand poverty. Poverty encompasses multidimensional aspects, including income deprivation, lack of access to basic services such as education and healthcare, limited social protection, and economic opportunities. By recognizing these factors, the SDG 1 aims to address poverty holistically and comprehensively.

Global Overview
Although significant progress has been made in reducing extreme poverty, with the global poverty rate dropping dramatically over the past few decades, it remains an alarming concern. According to the 2020 World Bank estimates, about 9.3% of the global population, or approximately 700 million people, were still living in extreme poverty (living on less than $1.90 per day). Additionally, over two billion people experience moderate or severe poverty when considering other dimensions such as access to basic needs.

Regional Disparities
Regional disparities in poverty rates persist, demanding targeted efforts to achieve the SDG 1. Sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, is home to the largest number of extremely poor people, with nearly 50% of the population living below the international poverty line. Other regions, including South Asia and parts of Latin America, also face significant challenges in poverty eradication.

Persistent Challenges
While efforts have been made to accelerate progress towards SDG 1, numerous challenges remain. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated poverty, pushing millions of people into extreme poverty due to economic downturns and disrupted access to critical resources. Inadequate access to quality education, lack of job opportunities, gender inequalities, and social exclusion continue to hinder poverty reduction efforts globally.

Governmental Commitments and Policies
To achieve SDG 1, governments play a fundamental role in implementing effective poverty reduction policies conducive to sustainable development. Prioritizing poverty eradication in national policies, allocating budgets for social protection programs, and developing projects for skills training and job creation are key components for addressing poverty from a systemic perspective. Promoting inclusive growth, progress towards decent work for all, and strong social safety nets are crucial considerations worthy of attention.

The Role of International Cooperation
Collaboration among governments, development actors, and international organizations is paramount towards achieving the SDGs. Financial assistance, capacity building, and knowledge sharing can facilitate poverty reduction efforts within and across countries. It is essential for international cooperation to prioritize poverty eradication, ensuring that financial resources and technical support are effectively channeled to countries most in need.

Promising Examples and Innovations
Despite the challenges, several countries and organizations have made commendable progress in tackling poverty. Numerous innovative approaches, such as conditional cash transfer programs, microfinance initiatives, and social insurance schemes, have demonstrated positive results in reducing poverty levels. Learning from successful cases and adapting suitable interventions can lead to both replication and scalability, propelling SDG 1 in the right direction.

Conclusion
The SDG 1 represents an ambitious and crucial endeavor to eradicate poverty globally. Engaging governments, fostering international cooperation, and implementing effective policies are essential steps towards ensuring sustainable pathways out of poverty. Targeted efforts to address regional disparities, invest in human capital, promote gender equality, and provide social protection are central to the realization of SDG 1, ultimately improving the well-being and opportunities for the most vulnerable populations. Continued commitment and collective action are imperative to lay the foundation for a future free from poverty.
