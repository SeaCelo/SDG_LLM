In recent decades, the topic of poverty eradication has increasingly gained attention in the international development agenda. Governments, NGOs, and citizens around the world recognize the urgency of addressing this fundamental issue, as its ramifications extend into every aspect of human life. In response to this global challenge, the United Nations set ambitious targets under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). SDG 1, in particular, aims to end poverty in all its forms by 2030.

As discussed in the literature, poverty is a multi-dimensional concept that encompasses not only the lack of income but also limited access to basic services, education, health care, and social protection. It is clear that merely focusing on increasing GDP or average income levels is an inadequate approach to alleviating poverty. The SDGs take a holistic view by addressing several interrelated dimensions simultaneously.

To effectively address poverty, SDG 1 emphasizes the importance of promoting inclusive economic growth, ensuring equal access to resources, and establishing an enabling environment for income generation. Governments are encouraged to develop comprehensive strategies that foster sustainable employment opportunities and provide social protection systems to buffer vulnerable populations from risk and shocks.

The interrelated nature of the SDGs becomes apparent when reviewing SDG 1 in conjunction with other goals, such as SDG 4 on education, SDG 3 on health, and SDG 10 on reducing inequalities. Education, for instance, plays a crucial role in poverty eradication. It equips individuals with the skills necessary for decent work, enhances their job prospects, and empowers them to contribute meaningfully to society. Therefore, achieving universal quality education is a fundamental pillar of SDG 1.

Furthermore, SDG 3, which focuses on ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all ages, is directly linked to SDG 1's objectives. Poor health and inadequate healthcare access can perpetuate poverty, pushing individuals and families into a vicious cycle of illness and economic precarity. By investing in robust health systems and promoting access to affordable and quality healthcare, countries can alleviate the burden of healthcare expenses on vulnerable populations and reduce their vulnerability to poverty.

SDG 10, on the other hand, recognizes the urgent need to reduce inequalities within and among countries. Poverty disproportionally affects certain marginalized groups, such as women, persons with disabilities, or ethnic and religious minorities. To address the root causes of poverty, it is imperative to dismantle structural discrimination, promote social inclusion, and ensure equal opportunities for all.

To monitor progress towards SDG 1, the UN has developed a range of indicators that cover various dimensions of poverty, including income inequality, social protection coverage, access to basic services, and land rights. Gathering accurate and timely data is crucial for tracking progress and ensuring that interventions are evidence-based and effectively targeted. Enhancing data collection and disaggregating it by different population groups are critical steps in leaving no one behind.

However, despite the ambitious goals and comprehensive framework outlined in SDG 1, progress in eradicating poverty remains slow and uneven. Many developing countries continue to grapple with high poverty rates, worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic, conflicts, and climate change impacts. Tackling poverty requires substantial investment in social welfare programs, infrastructure development, and sustainable livelihoods. International cooperation, financial assistance, and knowledge sharing play an instrumental role in supporting countries facing capacity constraints to achieve SDG 1 targets.

In conclusion, SDG 1 clearly highlights the multidimensional and interconnected nature of poverty. It argues for a paradigm shift that extends beyond income measurements and focuses on addressing the root causes of poverty through inclusive economic growth, social protection, equal access to resources, quality education, and healthcare. By integrating poverty eradication strategies with other SDGs, such as education, health, and reduced inequalities, we can move closer to the ambitious goal of ending poverty in all its forms by 2030. Achieving this goal, however, will require concerted efforts, collective action, and strong political commitment from both governments and the international community.
