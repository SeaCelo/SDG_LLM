According to the World Bank, the COVID-19 pandemic has pushed an additional 88-115 million people into extreme poverty. This staggering increase highlights the pressing need to address poverty eradication, as highlighted in Sustainable Development Goal 1: No Poverty.

Since the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted by world leaders in 2015, the international community has rallied behind the imperative to end poverty in all its forms by 2030. With its multi-dimensional approach, SDG 1 not only aims to decrease the number of people living in extreme poverty but also seeks to ensure equal access to resources, services, and opportunities for all individuals, irrespective of their income levels.

In our very own Chicago, poverty remains an uphill battle for many residents. The high cost of living, limited job opportunities, and the racial wealth gap contribute to the circumstances that keep individuals trapped in a cycle of poverty. Addressing poverty here requires a localized approach, where the government, non-profit organizations, and citizens come together to enact change.

One crucial aspect of achieving SDG 1 is addressing the issue of income inequality. While Chicago boasts a thriving economy, we cannot overlook the glaring disparities that exist among its residents. Bridging this gap involves promoting fair wages, improving educational opportunities, and advocating for policies that address racial and gender inequities. By uplifting marginalized communities and ensuring equal access to economic opportunities, we can strive towards reducing poverty rates in the city.

In addition to income inequality, SDG 1 also highlights the need for social protection systems to mitigate the impacts of poverty. This calls for the establishment and strengthening of social safety nets that provide assistance and support to those most vulnerable in society. Investments in health care, education, and affordable housing are crucial elements for individuals and families to break out of poverty traps.

One shining example of how Chicago is striving towards SDG 1 is through the expansion of affordable housing initiatives. Through a combination of public-private partnerships and government intervention, the city is making progress in ensuring that low-income families have access to safe and affordable housing options. However, there is still much work to be done as demand for affordable housing continues to exceed supply, leading to long waiting lists and homelessness.

It is also worth mentioning the efforts of local organizations that work tirelessly to lift individuals out of poverty. Community-based initiatives, such as workforce training programs, financial literacy workshops, and entrepreneurship support, provide residents with the tools they need to secure stable employment and achieve financial independence. These grassroots efforts are crucial in complementing governmental strategies to address poverty at a local level.

As we recognize the importance of SDG 1 both globally and locally, it is imperative that all stakeholders collaborate and carry out actions that leave no one behind. Every individual and organization has a role to play in eradicating poverty. From effecting systemic changes that address income inequality to participating in volunteer work, there are numerous avenues for all members of society to make an impact.

While the journey towards eradicating poverty may seem daunting, the Sustainable Development Goals remind us that collective efforts and ambitious targets can push the world closer to ending this great injustice. Let us rally behind SDG 1 as we work towards a future where poverty is a thing of the past, not just in Chicago but across the globe. Together, we can create a society that is equitable, just, and compassionate.
