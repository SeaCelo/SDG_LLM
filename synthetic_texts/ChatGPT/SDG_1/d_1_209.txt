Income inequality is a persistent dilemma that haunts societies worldwide. The Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1) by the United Nations was established to address this concern by seeking to end poverty in all its forms and dimensions. As an esteemed economist, I, Daron Acemoglu, endeavor to adequately discuss and analyze SDG 1 within the broader context of sustainable development and global socioeconomic disparities.

SDG 1 strives to ensure that by 2030, no individual in any part of the world would live in extreme poverty, defined as living on less than $1.90 per day. Eradicating poverty and reducing inequality are not only ethical but also essential for fostering inclusive and sustainable growth. Research and my own work in economics have revealed that income inequality is often a significant hindrance to economic dynamism and social stability.

Interrogating SDG 1 prompts an inquiry into the complex roots of poverty and inequality. It necessitates an exploration of global economic structures, governance, and power dynamics. One must recognize how economic institutions and societal arrangements can perpetuate or alleviate poverty. Accurate diagnosis of the causes helps tailor policy measures more effectively.

Income inequality is indicative of discrepancies in the access to resources, opportunities, and social mobility within a society. Such inequalities are frequently ingrained in the socioeconomic structures, power hierarchies, and historical legacies of a nation. Ineffective distribution of wealth, unequal access to education and healthcare, and discriminatory practices perpetuate the cycle of poverty and hinder sustainable development.

A multidimensional approach is indispensable to tackle poverty comprehensively. Beyond purely economic considerations, policymakers must also address social, environmental, and governance-related challenges. SDG 1 concurs with this perspective by highlighting the importance of social protection systems, inclusive economic growth, decent work, education, and access to essential services such as healthcare and energy. These are indispensable pillars that should reinforce one another for transformative change to occur.

However, it is crucial to recognize that simply eliminating poverty is not sufficient for sustainable development. Ensuring individuals have an adequate standard of living must be accompanied by measures that promote long-term growth and the breaking of intergenerational poverty traps. A multi-faceted strategy encompassing institutional reforms, equitable distribution of power, and inclusive policies is necessary.

In pursuing SDG 1, it is also instrumental to consider the structural factors that underpin inequality. Historical policies, discriminatory practices, and unequal power relations manifest in great disparities in income and wealth. To address this, governments must formulate inclusive policies that dismantle oppressive systems and aim to redress historical injustices, such as colonization or discrimination based on race, gender, or ethnicity.

Furthermore, SDG 1 can be achieved more effectively by fostering international collaboration and creating an enabling global environment. The imbalance in global trade, financial systems, and knowledge transfers has enabled few countries to accumulate wealth while leaving others disproportionately affected by poverty and inequality. Enhancing global cooperation, reducing trade barriers, and promoting fairer distribution of resources are pivotal steps in realizing broader economic justice.

In conclusion, SDG 1, seeking to eliminate poverty in all its dimensions, emphasizes the urgent need for significant transformations in economic, social, and political structures worldwide. Income inequality is deeply rooted in historical circumstances and institutional arrangements that propagate disparities in wealth, access to opportunities, and social mobility. A holistic approach is necessary, addressing economic, cultural, social, and environmental dimensions of poverty, while ensuring an equitable distribution of wealth and promoting inclusive growth. Achieving SDG 1 requires recognizing historical injustices, fostering global cooperation, and implementing policies that aim to empower marginalized communities. Commitment to addressing this global challenge is indispensable for achieving sustainable development and fostering a fairer and more inclusive world.
