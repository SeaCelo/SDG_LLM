The Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Italian Development Cooperation Programme presents a comprehensive analysis of Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1) - "No Poverty" as part of our ongoing commitment towards sustainable global development. This report aims to provide expert insight into the current state of poverty eradication efforts globally, the challenges faced along the way, and strategies for achieving the target set by SDG 1 by 2030.

Achieving the goal of eradicating extreme poverty is crucial for building a more inclusive and equitable society. Poverty not only deprives individuals of their basic needs and human rights but also limits their potential and adversely affects societal progress. The targets set under SDG 1 aim to address multiple dimensions of poverty, focusing on both income poverty and non-income dimensions such as access to basic services, social protection, and sustainable livelihoods.

At the global level, significant progress has been observed over the last two decades in reducing extreme poverty rates. The number of people living in extreme poverty decreased from 1.9 billion in 1990 to 736 million in 2015, primarily due to robust economic growth and effective poverty reduction policies implemented by many nations. However, it is essential to note that progress has not been evenly distributed, with regional disparities and pockets of extreme poverty witnessed in several parts of the world, including Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia.

Addressing the challenges of poverty eradication requires a holistic approach. This involves enhancing economic opportunities, social protection, access to basic services, and empowering marginalized communities. Investing in inclusive growth strategies, employment generation, and sustainable livelihoods play a crucial role in reducing poverty rates. Additionally, improving access to quality education, healthcare, clean water, and sanitation ensures a foundation for socioeconomic development.

Implementing effective social protection systems is a cornerstone of poverty reduction efforts. Safety nets, including conditional and unconditional cash transfer programs, provide a vital lifeline for vulnerable individuals and communities, enabling them to access basic needs, education, and health services. These programs have proven particularly successful in addressing intergenerational poverty, as they often come with conditions related to education or healthcare utilization.

Furthermore, fostering sustainable and resilient agricultural practices helps enhance food security and provide income stability to rural communities, who are often most affected by poverty. Investing in infrastructure development, both physical and digital, bridges the gap between rural and urban areas, unlocking socioeconomic opportunities and improving standards of living.

As a leading player in the field of international development cooperation, Italy remains committed to supporting global efforts towards achieving SDG 1. Italian development cooperation initiatives aim to create sustainable livelihood models, job creation, and improve access to basic services, particularly in countries heavily affected by poverty. Promoting gender equality and women's empowerment, as they are undeniably critical agents of change, forms an integral part of our approach. By strengthening national capacities, fostering partnerships, and sharing best practices, Italy strives to make a tangible impact on poverty reduction.

Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge that challenges persist, necessitating continuous innovation, knowledge sharing, and coordinated efforts. Sluggish economic growth, armed conflicts, natural disasters, and the recent COVID-19 pandemic have exacerbated poverty rates in many regions. Moreover, persistent inequalities, such as gender disparities and socio-economic divides, undermine progress towards SDG 1.

To overcome these challenges and reach the target set by SDG 1, it is imperative for nations to strengthen policy coherence, engage all stakeholders, and foster international cooperation. This entails aligning national development strategies with the principles of sustainability and poverty reduction and investing in data collection and evaluation systems to monitor progress effectively. Additionally, drawing upon experiences of successful interventions from across the globe facilitates evidence-based policymaking and program implementation.

In conclusion, while substantial progress has been made in reducing poverty globally, much work remains to be done to achieve SDG 1 by 2030. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Italian Development Cooperation Programme remains steadfastly committed to poverty eradication efforts, acknowledging the complex dynamics and multi-dimensional dimensions of poverty. By leveraging our collective expertise, fostering partnerships, and implementing targeted interventions, we aim to contribute towards a world where no one is left behind, where poverty is eradicated, and where sustainable development is truly achieved.
