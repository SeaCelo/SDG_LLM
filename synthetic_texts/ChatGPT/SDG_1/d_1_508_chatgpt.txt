Abstract:

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) play an imperative role in addressing global poverty and promoting inclusive economic growth. SDG 1 specifically focuses on eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions. This article examines SDG 1 through an economic lens, analyzing its objectives, key indicators, challenges, and potential policy implications to tackle poverty. Providing an in-depth analysis, this article aims to further contribute to the academic discourse around poverty eradication strategies and the economic implications of SDG 1.

Introduction:

SDG 1 represents a transformative commitment aimed at eliminating poverty worldwide. With this ambitious goal, policymakers have set out explicit targets and indicators to guide efforts towards eradicating extreme poverty, achieving economic security, and facilitating the sustainable livelihoods of all individuals. As the world grapples with increasing inequality and multidimensional poverty, understanding the economic aspects of SDG 1 is crucial for devising effective strategies to achieve poverty eradication.

Objectives and Indicators:

SDG 1 addresses poverty in the broadest sense, encompassing both income poverty and non-income dimensions. The four main targets of the goal are: (1) eradicating extreme poverty (living on less than $1.90 a day), (2) reducing poverty in all its dimensions, (3) implementing social protection systems, and (4) addressing vulnerabilities caused by disasters and conflict.

To measure progress towards these targets, a set of statistical indicators has been established. These indicators include the proportion of people living in extreme poverty, the Poverty Gap Index, the Palma ratio (representing income inequality), and the percentage of individuals covered by social protection systems. These comprehensive and multidimensional indicators provide a holistic view of poverty and guide policymakers in identifying the areas that require immediate attention.

Challenges:

Addressing poverty through an economic lens poses various challenges. First and foremost, challenges related to data availability and reliability hinder the accurate measurement and monitoring of poverty and associated indicators. Discrepancies in data collection methodologies across countries, along with the difficulty of capturing non-income dimensions of poverty, undermine efforts to craft effective policies.

Another key challenge lies in navigating economic inequalities. While economic growth is vital for poverty reduction, ensuring that growth is inclusive poses significant hurdles. Inequalities in access to resources, markets, and opportunities can perpetuate poverty, exacerbating social and economic disparities. Thus, promoting inclusive economic growth is crucial to fight poverty sustainably.

Policy Implications:

To effectively tackle poverty, policymakers need to employ a combination of strategies and policies. The SDGs call for a responsive and integrated approach, where social and economic policies are aligned to address poverty comprehensively.

Investing in human capital is crucial, as education and skill-building opportunities can empower individuals to escape poverty traps. Ensuring universal access to healthcare is another important component, as it enables people to maintain healthy lives and handle economic shocks without falling into poverty.

Income redistribution measures and improving social protection systems play a significant role in reducing poverty and vulnerability. Policies such as cash transfers, public job creation programs, and targeted assistance to marginalized groups can enhance social safety nets while addressing income disparities.

Furthermore, addressing institutional constraints, such as corruption and inadequate governance, is vital for poverty reduction. Good governance practices, transparent institutions, and strong rule of law support sustainable economic growth and equitable distribution of resources.

Conclusion:

SDG 1 represents a significant step towards fulfilling the global commitment to eradicate poverty, emphasizing the need for economic perspectives to drive comprehensive strategies. By focusing on income and non-income dimensions of poverty, policymakers can craft effective policies that aim to reduce poverty across all its dimensions. Despite the challenges, progress has been made in addressing poverty, and by fostering inclusive economic growth and implementing tailored policies, sustainable poverty eradication can be achieved.
