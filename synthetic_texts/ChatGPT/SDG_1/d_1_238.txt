Abstract:
The Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1) aims to "end poverty in all its forms everywhere" by 2030. This article provides a comprehensive understanding of the multidimensional challenges and potential strategies to achieve this goal. It begins by discussing the significance of SDG 1 in the broader context of global development and poverty eradication efforts. It then reviews the indicators and targets established under SDG 1 and analyzes their progress. Additionally, this article delves into the interlinkages between poverty and other sustainable development goals, highlighting the need for integrated approaches. Lastly, it explores innovative policies, programs, and initiatives at the national and international levels that have shown promise in poverty reduction.

1. Introduction
The eradication of poverty remains a focal point of global development efforts. SDG 1 builds upon the Millennium Development Goals' (MDGs) poverty reduction targets by expanding the scope of poverty to encompass multidimensional aspects. This goal recognizes that poverty is not solely defined by income levels but also includes limited access to education, health services, clean water, and sanitation, among others.

2. Indicators and Progress
SDG 1 is measured through indicators such as the proportion of the population living below the international poverty line and the prevalence of extreme poverty in various dimensions. While progress has been made in reducing global poverty rates, disparities still exist between and within countries. Achieving the ambitious targets set by SDG 1 requires concerted efforts and innovative policies.

3. Interlinkages with Other SDGs
Poverty is intertwined with various other sustainable development goals, such as education (SDG 4), gender equality (SDG 5), and health and well-being (SDG 3). For instance, lack of access to quality education perpetuates intergenerational poverty. Recognizing these interdependencies, integrated approaches are crucial for addressing poverty comprehensively.

4. Innovative Policies and Approaches
Several innovative policies and programs have emerged to tackle poverty. One example is conditional cash transfer programs, such as Mexico's Oportunidades and Brazil's Bolsa Fam√≠lia. These programs provide direct cash transfers to low-income families contingent upon fulfilling certain conditions, such as regular school attendance and health check-ups. They not only alleviate immediate poverty but also break the vicious cycle of poverty by investing in human capital.

Targeted poverty reduction schemes, like India's Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), offer employment opportunities for the rural poor while also enhancing rural infrastructure. These initiatives empower individuals and communities, enabling them to sustainably improve their living conditions.

Furthermore, global partnerships and funding mechanisms, such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Bank, play a vital role in supporting poverty alleviation efforts. Efficient allocation of financial resources and capacity building at the national and local levels are necessary for effective implementation of poverty reduction programs.

5. Conclusion and the Way Forward
SDG 1 serves as a crucial framework for addressing the multidimensional aspects of poverty. By integrating poverty eradication efforts with other sustainability goals, the potential for achieving transformative change is enhanced. However, promoting inclusive economic growth, ensuring social protection, investing in education and healthcare, supporting sustainable agriculture, and empowering marginalized communities are among the key strategies needed to accomplish SDG 1.

It is imperative for governments, civil society organizations, and the private sector to collaborate, share best practices, and align their efforts towards poverty eradication. Additionally, adequate monitoring and evaluation mechanisms are indispensable for accurately assessing progress and identifying areas that require further attention.

Ultimately, the realization of SDG 1 requires a broad-based commitment to equity, social justice, and sustainable development. Only through collective action can we achieve a world where poverty no longer hampers the potential of individuals and communities to thrive and contribute to the well-being of society as a whole.
