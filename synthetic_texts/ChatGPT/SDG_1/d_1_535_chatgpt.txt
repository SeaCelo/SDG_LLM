Abstract:
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim to address the world's most pressing challenges, and SDG 1 specifically targets ending poverty in all its forms. This article utilizes an academic lens to delve into the intricacies of SDG 1, focusing on the multidimensional approach required to tackle poverty eradication sustainably. Drawing from research and expert opinions, this paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the current state of poverty, the prospects of achieving SDG 1 within the specified time frame, and the transformative strategies that contribute to poverty eradication worldwide.

Introduction: 
SDG 1 serves as a framework through which nations can address poverty on various fronts, taking into account the interconnectedness between poverty and other development challenges. This article explores how poverty is defined by the multidimensional aspects encompassing income, education, health, housing, water, sanitation, and access to essential services. It also highlights the transformative potential of SDG 1, inherent trade-offs, and the interconnected nature of all SDGs in realizing poverty alleviation effectively.

State of Poverty:
In order to address poverty effectively, understanding its complexity and contemporary manifestations is crucial. The analysis begins by presenting the current global poverty scenario, considering both relative and absolute measures, and highlighting spatial and regional disparities. Furthermore, it examines the structural causes contributing to poverty and emphasizes the gender and social dimensions that exacerbate its persistence.

Pathways to Eradication:
Moving beyond traditional approaches that focus solely on boosting income, this section explores alternative pathways that emphasize inclusive growth, access to quality education, and basic services. It presents empirical evidence showcasing the effectiveness of social protection schemes, active labor market policies, and investments in human capital for fostering sustainable development and poverty reduction. By providing a holistic understanding of poverty eradication strategies, this section contributes to the coherent implementation of SDG 1.

Impediments to Achieving SDG 1:
While the SDGs provide a powerful vision for global development, they face numerous challenges on the ground. This section addresses the potential roadblocks in eradicating poverty within the prescribed timeframe, such as climate change, conflicts, economic inequalities, and lack of political will and institutional capacity. It recognizes the need for targeted interventions, international cooperation, and effective governance mechanisms to overcome these obstacles.

The Role of Partnerships:
