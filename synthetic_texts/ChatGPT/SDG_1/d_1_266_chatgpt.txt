Abstract:
This article provides a comprehensive analysis of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1, which focuses on ending poverty in all its forms everywhere. It explores the underlying causes of poverty, the targeted objectives set by the United Nations (UN), and the progress made in achieving this goal. Moreover, it evaluates the strategies and policies adopted by various countries to alleviate poverty, emphasizing the importance of inclusive economic growth, social safety nets, and access to basic services. The article also highlights the interconnectedness of poverty with other SDGs, such as education, healthcare, and gender equality. Lastly, it presents recommendations for accelerating progress towards achieving SDG 1 by addressing structural barriers, promoting inclusive development, and fostering global cooperation.

Introduction:
SDG 1, rooted in the principle of leaving no one behind, underscores the urgent need to eradicate extreme poverty globally. Poverty constitutes a multidimensional phenomenon, encompassing financial, social, and political aspects that hinder individuals from leading a dignified life. The goal of SDG 1 goes beyond simply reducing the poverty headcount; it focuses on the overall improvement of livelihoods and social well-being.

Causes and Manifestations of Poverty:
Understanding the causes and manifestations of poverty is crucial for effective poverty eradication strategies. Poverty is often perpetuated by inequalities in income distribution, lack of productive resources, inadequate access to education and healthcare, limited job opportunities, and insufficient social protection systems. Moreover, socio-cultural factors such as discrimination, marginalization, and political instability also contribute to persistent poverty.

The Targeted Objectives:
SDG 1 has set three primary objectives to be achieved by 2030. Firstly, it aims to reduce the proportion of people living in extreme poverty (defined by the World Bank as earning less than $1.90 per day). Secondly, it aims to implement nationally appropriate social protection systems to safeguard vulnerable populations from economic shocks. Thirdly, it calls for equal rights to economic resources, including land, property, and technology for all, especially for women, indigenous groups, and the marginalized.

Progress and Challenges:
Global efforts towards achieving SDG 1 have witnessed some notable progress. Between 2000 and 2015, extreme poverty rates decreased from 36% to 10%, thanks to the success of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and targeted poverty reduction strategies. However, progress has been uneven across regions, with Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia still grappling with persistently high poverty rates. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated poverty levels further, threatening to reverse the gains made in recent years.

Strategies and Policies:
Countries pursuing inclusive growth strategies have demonstrated significant progress in poverty reduction. Policies emphasizing robust macroeconomic management, inclusive fiscal policies, equitable access to basic services, and infrastructure development have shown positive outcomes. Complementary approaches like social safety nets, conditional cash transfers, and skills development initiatives have also proven instrumental in lifting people out of poverty traps.

Interlinkages with other SDGs:
SDG 1 is intrinsically interconnected with several other SDGs. Education (SDG 4), healthcare (SDG 3), clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), and gender equality (SDG 5) play pivotal roles in breaking the cycle of poverty and promoting sustainable development. Indeed, it is recognized that poverty eradication cannot be achieved in isolation but rather requires a holistic approach encompassing multiple dimensions of development.

Recommendations for Accelerating Progress:
To accelerate progress towards SDG 1, policymakers and international organizations need to tackle structural barriers that perpetuate poverty, such as inequalities in access to productive resources. Furthermore, there is a need to prioritize inclusive development strategies, focusing on marginalized groups, women, and disadvantaged communities. Strengthening social protection systems, investing in quality education and healthcare, fostering job creation, and promoting sustainable and climate-resilient livelihoods are key priorities. Lastly, enhanced global cooperation, including increased Official Development Assistance (ODA) to the least developed countries, technology transfer, and knowledge sharing, is essential for the successful attainment of SDG 1.

Conclusion:
SDG 1, aimed at ending poverty in all its forms everywhere, presents a formidable challenge that demands coordinated efforts from policymakers, governments, civil society, and the international community. By addressing the multidimensional nature of poverty, employing inclusive policies, and recognizing the interconnectedness with other SDGs, progress towards achieving SDG 1 can be accelerated. Eradicating poverty is not only a moral imperative but also a necessary step towards sustainable development and the establishment of a just and equitable world.
