Introduction:
In recent years, the international community has recognized the pressing need to eradicate poverty in all its forms and dimensions. To address this global challenge, Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1) was established as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. SDG 1 aims to end poverty in all its manifestations by 2030 and promotes shared prosperity, social inclusion, and the empowerment of all people. This report provides an in-depth analysis of SDG 1 within the context of least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDs), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs). Understanding the unique challenges faced by these countries is essential for formulating effective strategies to achieve this ambitious goal.

I. Current Status and Challenges of Poverty in LDCs, SIDs, and LLDCs:
LDCs, SIDs, and LLDCs are particularly vulnerable to poverty due to a combination of structural weaknesses, geographic disadvantages, and limited capacity to generate sufficient income. Approximately a third of the population in LDCs lives in extreme poverty, with limited access to basic services, predominantly in rural areas. Similarly, SIDs face significant challenges with high rates of poverty, limited agricultural productivity, and vulnerability to climate change impacts such as rising sea levels and natural disasters. LLDCs, devoid of direct coastal access, face additional barriers to trade, which impairs their ability to escape poverty and engage in global markets.

II. Strategies to Address Extreme Poverty in LDCs, SIDs, and LLDCs:
A. Strengthening Social Protection Systems:
Policy interventions should prioritize strengthening social protection systems tailored to specific country contexts. Safety nets, including targeted cash transfers, and public works programs have proven effective in reducing poverty and vulnerability. To build resilience, these programs should be supported by measures to promote inclusive growth, sustainable livelihoods, and decent work opportunities.

B. Enhancing Agricultural Productivity:
Agriculture remains a primary sector in these countries, providing livelihoods for a substantial portion of the population. Enhancing agricultural productivity through training, access to affordable credit, and modern technologies is crucial. Investments in irrigation, research and development, and sustainable farming practices can enable smallholders to increase their income and exit poverty.

C. Improving Access to Basic Services:
Robust investments in education, healthcare, and infrastructure play a vital role in reducing poverty and promoting sustainable development. Children in poverty-stricken areas often lack access to quality education, perpetuating intergenerational poverty cycles. Proactive policies that guarantee access to quality education, healthcare, and sanitation can uplift communities and break the cycle of poverty.

III. Mobilizing Resources for Poverty Eradication in LDCs, SIDs, and LLDCs:
A. Official Development Assistance (ODA):
International cooperation, especially through ODA, continues to play a critical role in supporting poverty eradication efforts in these countries. Donor countries must uphold their commitments to allocate at least 0.7% of their gross national income to development assistance. Targeted and effective allocation of assistance can promote economic growth, support infrastructure development, and bolster social protection systems in these vulnerable countries.

B. Enhancing Domestic Resource Mobilization:
Increasing domestic resource mobilization is vital for sustainable development. Governments should foster an enabling environment for private sector investment, improve tax systems, tackle illicit financial flows, strengthen public financial management, and advance regional integration to diversify economies. Expanding the tax base and improving tax administration can ensure increased revenue for poverty reduction efforts.

IV. Promoting International Cooperation and Partnerships:
A. Trade and Market Access:
Enhancing trade facilitation and market access for LDCs, SIDs, and LLDCs is key to poverty eradication. Reducing tariff and non-tariff barriers, improving trade infrastructure, and providing technical assistance can support these countries in effectively participating in global trade. Special and differential treatment must be maintained to account for their unique vulnerabilities and challenges.

B. Transfer of Technology:
Closing the technological divide is crucial for sustainable development and poverty eradication. International cooperation should focus on technology transfer, capacity building, and innovation to enhance productivity, particularly in agriculture and industrial sectors. Efforts to bridge the digital divide and increase digital literacy can enable these countries to harness the transformational power of technology.

Conclusion:
SDG 1 offers a comprehensive framework to address the multifaceted challenges of extreme poverty in LDCs, SIDs, and LLDCs. Achieving this goal necessitates targeted approaches that address the specific needs of these countries. Mobilizing resources, strengthening social protection systems, enhancing agricultural productivity, improving access to basic services, promoting international cooperation, and facilitating trade are essential pillars of poverty eradication efforts. By delivering on these commitments, the international community can help these countries escape the cycle of poverty, ensuring a more inclusive and prosperous future for all.
