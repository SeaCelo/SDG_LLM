The Sustainable Development Goal 17 (SDG 17) is one of the seventeen goals set by the United Nations in its 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. SDG 17 emphasizes the importance of partnerships and the need to strengthen global cooperation to achieve all the other Sustainable Development Goals. This goal addresses the fundamental requirement of “Revitalizing Global Partnerships for Sustainable Development.” The objective of this analytical report, written by the Organization for Investment, is to provide a detailed analysis of SDG 17, targeting an expert audience.

SDG 17 recognizes that accomplishing sustainable development requires collaborative efforts between various stakeholders, including governments, private sector entities, civil society organizations, and development partners. It underscores the significance of mobilizing and utilizing resources effectively, creating enabling policy frameworks, and enhancing international cooperation for sustainable development.

The interdependent nature of SDG 17 and the other sixteen goals necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the areas that need to be improved for a successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda. This report critically assesses the progress, challenges, and prospects of SDG 17 by focusing on three key areas: finance, technology, and capacity-building.

Firstly, financing plays a crucial role in achieving the goals set forth by SDG 17. The report highlights the need to enhance financial resources, promote investment in sustainable development initiatives, and create an enabling environment for domestic and international financing. It examines the effectiveness of existing financial mechanisms, such as Official Development Assistance (ODA), Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), and innovative financing mechanisms. Furthermore, the report explores potential avenues for increasing public and private investment in sustainable development, such as blended finance models and impact investment.

Secondly, technology transfer and knowledge sharing are imperative for sustainable development. This report emphasizes the importance of technology, innovation, and research and development in addressing global challenges and promoting sustainable growth. It examines the role of various stakeholders, including governments, multinational companies, and academic institutions, in facilitating technology transfer and diffusion to developing countries. The report also evaluates the availability and accessibility of affordable and sustainable technologies, addressing issues such as intellectual property rights and the digital divide.

Lastly, capacity-building is a critical aspect of SDG 17. The report analyzes the development and strengthening of institutional capacities at national, regional, and international levels to support sustainable development efforts. It explores the need for capacity-building in areas such as data collection and monitoring, policy formulation and implementation, and knowledge management.
