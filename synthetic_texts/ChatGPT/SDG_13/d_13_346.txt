The Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID) is pleased to present this analytical report focusing on Sustainable Development Goal 13: Climate Action. This report aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the current state of SDG 13 and its implications for achieving a sustainable and resilient future, as well as highlighting notable achievements and challenges in this area.

SDG 13 recognizes the urgent need to address climate change and its impacts, which pose significant threats to both people and the planet. Mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, adapting to changing climatic conditions, and enhancing capacity for climate change-related planning and management are central elements of this goal.

To achieve SDG 13, concerted efforts at the international, national, and local levels are required. The report begins by examining the progress made so far in global climate action. One standout achievement is the international consensus reached through the Paris Agreement in 2015, which provides a framework for reducing emissions and mobilizing financial resources for climate change adaptation and mitigation. The AECID actively supports and contributes to the implementation of the Paris Agreement through various development projects and initiatives.

In Spain, significant accomplishments have been made in certain areas of climate action. The nation is gradually decreasing its carbon intensity, promoting renewable energy investments, and initiating a transition to a more sustainable model of transportation. Moreover, Spain has developed a comprehensive legislative framework to address climate change, bolstering research and innovation efforts in pursuit of a low-carbon economy.

However, challenges persist in fully realizing the targets set under SDG 13. Increasing public and political awareness of the severity of climate change remains a key challenge. Encouraging behavioral change and engaging all stakeholders, such as businesses and civil society, is crucial to achieving the necessary transformations. Additionally, the financing gap for climate adaptation and mitigation measures needs to be adequately addressed. The AECID supports countries in advancing climate-resilient projects through technical assistance, capacity building, and financial support.

While global climate action has made progress, it is vital to acknowledge the differential impacts of climate change on vulnerable communities and regions. This report also examines how climate change exacerbates existing inequalities, particularly in developing countries. Women, rural populations, indigenous peoples, and other marginalized groups face higher vulnerability due to limited resources and capacities. The Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation remains committed to addressing these disparities by promoting inclusive and gender-responsive climate action.

Furthermore, monitoring climate change is essential for effective policy formulation. This report underscores the importance of credible and timely data collection, monitoring, and reporting to inform climate change adaptation strategies. Spain has been actively participating in various international initiatives, such as the World Meteorological Organization, to strengthen data availability and climate change modeling capabilities.

As the effects of climate change continue to shape our world, SDG 13 offers a vital roadmap for climate action. The AECID recognizes the urgency and complexity of this challenge, and through collaboration and support at national and international levels, we remain committed to achieving the targets outlined in SDG 13. By strengthening resilience, promoting decarbonization, and ensuring climate justice, we can pave the way towards a sustainable and equitable future for all.
