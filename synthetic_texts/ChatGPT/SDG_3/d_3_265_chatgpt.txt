Title: Sustainable Development Goal 3: Ensuring Healthy Lives and Promoting Well-being for All Ages

Introduction:
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) put forth by the United Nations aim at addressing the world's most pressing challenges, such as poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation. SDG 3, titled "Good Health and Well-being," stands as a prominent goal, emphasizing the need to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all ages. This article, written in the style of renowned economist and Nobel laureate Edward C. Prescott, provides an in-depth analysis of SDG 3's objectives, motivations, and implications for sustainable development.

1. Background:
To comprehensively address the diverse health challenges prevailing across nations, SDG 3 identifies a range of targets. Its primary focus lies in reducing mortality rates, combating major diseases, improving access to essential healthcare services, and promoting mental health and well-being at a global level. These aims intersect with other SDGs, such as eradicating poverty (SDG 1), achieving gender equality (SDG 5), and promoting quality education (SDG 4).

2. Objectives:
A. Health and Mortality:
SDG 3 aims at reducing maternal and child mortality rates, providing access to reproductive healthcare, and ensuring universal healthcare coverage. Targeting these subgoals will require augmenting healthcare infrastructure, enhancing healthcare services in rural and remote areas, and strengthening health systems in lower-income countries. The objective is to achieve an overall reduction in global mortality rates and improve the overall health status of populations.

B. Communicable and Non-communicable Diseases:
SDG 3 also focuses on combatting a multitude of communicable and non-communicable diseases. It entails enhancing prevention, treatment, and control measures for HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and other neglected tropical diseases. Moreover, addressing non-communicable diseases like cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and mental health disorders is integral to achieving this goal. This necessitates increased investment in research and development, improved healthcare infrastructure, and knowledge transfer through international collaborations.

C. Universal Health Coverage:
Realizing universal health coverage (UHC) is perceived as key to sustainable development and achievement of SDG 3. UHC implies that all individuals and communities can access quality health services without experiencing financial hardship. To achieve this, countries need to strengthen their health systems, expand health insurance coverage, and focus on promoting primary healthcare interventions. A strong emphasis on achieving equitable access to essential medicines, vaccines, and health technologies should also be prioritized.

3. Implications and Challenges for Sustainable Development:
A. Intersectoral Collaboration:
Arguably, the biggest challenge in achieving SDG 3 lies in intersectoral collaboration. As health is influenced by multiple social, economic, and environmental factors, effective implementation of measures outlined under SDG 3 requires collaboration between various sectors beyond the traditional healthcare realm. Cross-sectoral initiatives have the potential to address overarching determinants of health, such as education, employment, poverty reduction, and environmental sustainability.

B. Financing for Health:
Sustainable financing is essential to achieve the ambitious targets set by SDG 3. Countries need to allocate sufficient resources to strengthen health systems, improve healthcare infrastructure, and expand access to essential services. Further support from the global community through increased Official Development Assistance (ODA) and innovative financing mechanisms is critical to support low- and middle-income countries in their health-related endeavors.

C. Data Collection and Monitoring:
Monitoring progress towards achieving SDG 3-related targets necessitates robust data collection systems. This requirement includes reliable health information systems, surveillance mechanisms, and timely reporting frameworks. Capacity-building measures in data collection, analysis, and evaluation should be prioritized to inform evidence-based decision-making and track progress effectively.

Conclusion:
SDG 3 facilitates a comprehensive approach to improve health outcomes and promote well-being for all ages. With its focus on diverse health challenges, universal health coverage, and intersectoral collaboration, SDG 3 holds considerable potential to drive transformations in healthcare systems and achieve sustainable development globally. Upholding and accelerating progress towards this goal calls for intensified efforts, increased investments, and strengthened international partnerships to ensure that future generations reap the benefits of a healthier and more prosperous world.
