The current Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) that I will be analyzing in this report is SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being. As an expert in this field, I am writing this report on behalf of the International Organization for Migration (IOM). Our organization aims to address the complex challenges related to migration, including the impact it has on health and well-being.

SDG 3 focuses on ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages. This goal incorporates several targets that address key health issues around the world. These targets include reducing the global maternal mortality ratio, ending preventable deaths of newborns and children under five, combating communicable diseases, and strengthening the prevention and treatment of non-communicable diseases.

At IOM, we recognize the critical link between migration and health. The movement of people across borders presents unique challenges to achieving SDG 3. Migration itself can impact health and well-being through various factors such as forced displacement, economic migration, and the social determinants of health.

One of the key challenges we face in achieving SDG 3 is ensuring access to quality healthcare for migrants, regardless of their legal status. Many migrants lack access to basic healthcare services, leading to increased vulnerability to diseases and poor health outcomes. This challenge requires a collaborative effort from governments, civil society organizations, and the international community to remove barriers and provide inclusive healthcare services for all.

The impact of COVID-19 has further highlighted the significance of SDG 3 in the context of migration. The pandemic has not only affected the physical health of migrants but also their mental health. The temporary closure of borders and restrictions on travel have created insecurity and uncertainty among migrants, exacerbating existing vulnerabilities. Addressing the mental health needs of migrants is crucial in achieving SDG 3 as this contributes to overall well-being.

Addressing the health needs of migrants also requires considering different aspects of their journey. During transit, migrants often face limited access to healthcare services, sanitation, and hygiene facilities. Migrant shelters and detention centers can become overcrowded, increasing the risk of the spread of diseases. As an organization working directly with migrants, IOM is actively involved in providing healthcare services and ensuring health promotion in migration contexts.

An essential aspect of achieving SDG 3 is promoting universal health coverage (UHC). UHC ensures that everyone can access the health services they need without facing financial hardship. For migrants, accessing UHC can be particularly challenging due to legal and administrative barriers. IOM supports governments in adopting inclusive health policies that address the specific health needs of migrants, regardless of their legal status.

To address the health challenges of migration, collaboration and coordination among relevant stakeholders are crucial. Governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector need to work together to develop holistic approaches to achieve SDG 3. Sharing best practices, exchanging knowledge, and providing technical assistance are some of the strategies that can be used to enhance the health and well-being of migrants.

In conclusion, SDG 3 aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all by addressing various health challenges. The unique circumstances of migration, including forced displacement and economic migration, require special attention to ensure the health needs of migrants are met. Collaboration among stakeholders is vital in developing inclusive health policies, promoting universal health coverage, and addressing the social determinants of health for migrants. By integrating migration into the implementation of SDG 3, we can collectively work towards achieving healthy lives and well-being for all people.
