The European Investment Bank (EIB) has conducted a comprehensive analysis of Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3) to assess the current status of global efforts towards achieving this goal and to provide recommendations for future actions. SDG 3 aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.

Health is a fundamental human right, and SDG 3 serves as an essential guideline to improve public health and reduce preventable mortality rates globally. This report illuminates key aspects of goal 3, identifying both progress and challenges, while highlighting the potential role of sustainable financing mechanisms.

Progress towards SDG 3 has been commendable, but considerable gaps and disparities persist. The four target areas of SDG 3 are in reducing maternal and child mortality; ending the epidemics of communicable diseases; ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive healthcare services; and achieving universal health coverage (UHC), including financial risk protection.

Significant progress has been made in reducing the global maternal and child mortality rates. However, several regions, particularly sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, still face challenges, largely driven by limited access to quality healthcare services and inadequate funding. The EIB recognizes the critical importance of enforcing policies that ensure equitable access to healthcare facilities, strengthen healthcare infrastructure, and invest in education and training programs for healthcare professionals in these regions.

One of the most remarkable global health achievements has been the successful control of some communicable diseases, such as tuberculosis and malaria, while progress continues to be made in combating HIV/AIDS, though more effort is needed. Despite this progress, emerging epidemics, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, pose significant challenges to global health. The EIB attaches great importance to intensifying research and development efforts, and supporting countries' healthcare systems to strengthen their preparedness and response capabilities.

Universal access to sexual and reproductive health services remains a significant challenge worldwide. Insufficient financing, over-regulation, and limited infrastructure pose barriers for many people, particularly in low-income countries. It is crucial to combat stigma and discrimination, engage local communities, and provide comprehensive sex education. Investment in the health workforce, digital health technologies, and building resilient healthcare systems will expedite progress in this area.

The pursuit of UHC is closely linked to sustainable financing mechanisms. While many countries have made efforts to expand their coverage, large populations remain excluded from necessary healthcare services, leading to preventable deaths and financial hardships. The EIB advocates for increased funding and innovative financing models to ensure universal access to quality and affordable healthcare services.

Moreover, it is necessary to emphasize the importance of strengthening primary healthcare systems. Strong primary healthcare can act as a backbone for achieving all components of SDG 3. By prioritizing preventative care and addressing the social determinants of health, countries can reduce the burden on hospitals, decrease healthcare costs, and improve health outcomes.

In conclusion, significant progress has been made in pursuing SDG 3, but challenges persist, requiring intensified efforts and targeted investments. The EIB highlights the importance of equitable access to healthcare, the control of communicable diseases, universal access to sexual and reproductive health services, and achieving universal health coverage. By addressing these challenges and adopting sustainable financing mechanisms, we can move closer to attaining SDG 3 and ensuring healthy lives and well-being for all.
