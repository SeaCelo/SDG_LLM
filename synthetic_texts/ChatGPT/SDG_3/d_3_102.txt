The Sustainable Development Goal number 3 (SDG 3), adopted by the United Nations in 2015, revolves around ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages. With its significant focus on health and well-being, SDG 3 seeks to tackle various fundamental challenges to achieving universal health coverage and addressing the leading causes of illness and death globally.

One of the key priorities of SDG 3 is to reduce global maternal and child mortality rates. Despite significant progress in recent years, maternal mortality remains a pressing issue in many parts of the world. Approximately 295,000 women died during pregnancy or childbirth in 2017, with the majority of these deaths occurring in developing countries. SDG 3 aims to reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030. Achieving this goal will require targeted investments in maternal health, access to quality healthcare services, and improving the overall status of women.

Child mortality is another crucial area of focus under SDG 3. Every day, thousands of children die from preventable causes such as pneumonia, diarrhea, and malaria. SDG 3 aims to end preventable deaths of newborns and children under the age of five, by reducing the under-five mortality rate to as low as 25 deaths per 1,000 live births and ensuring access to essential healthcare services and vaccines. Improving nutrition, ensuring clean water and sanitation, and strengthening healthcare systems are vital components of achieving this outcome.

Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and mental disorders, are a growing burden on global health. SDG 3 emphasizes the need to promote mental health and well-being and reduce premature mortality due to NCDs by one-third through prevention, treatment, and promoting health education. Empowering individuals to make healthy lifestyle choices, implementing effective national health policies, and strengthening healthcare infrastructure are vital to achieving this target.

Combatting infectious diseases is also central to SDG 3. While significant progress has been made in reducing the burden of diseases like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, these remain substantial challenges in many parts of the world. SDG 3 aims to end epidemics such as AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and neglected tropical diseases by 2030. This can be achieved through increased funding for research and development of vaccines and medicines, strengthening healthcare systems, and improving access to quality healthcare services, particularly in low-income countries.

Access to essential healthcare services is a fundamental aspect of SDG 3. Many individuals, particularly in low-income countries, face barriers such as inadequate infrastructure, limited healthcare workforce, and financial constraints, preventing them from receiving necessary healthcare. SDG 3 aims to achieve universal health coverage, ensuring that all individuals have access to quality healthcare services without facing financial hardship. Achieving this goal requires innovative approaches, including bolstering primary healthcare systems, reducing out-of-pocket expenses, and building sustainable healthcare infrastructure.

Furthermore, SDG 3 also encompasses the importance of addressing substance abuse, road traffic accidents, and the harmful use of tobacco and alcohol. By establishing policies and legislations to reduce the burden of these risk factors, SDG 3 promotes overall health and aims to create environments conducive to healthy lifestyles.

To measure progress towards achieving SDG 3, several indicators have been defined. These include maternal mortality ratio, neonatal mortality rate, under-five mortality rate, HIV prevalence rate, tuberculosis incidence rate, vaccination coverage, prevalence of substance abuse, and coverage of health insurance schemes, among others. Adequate data collection and monitoring mechanisms are critical to track progress, identify challenges, and guide implementation efforts.

In conclusion, SDG 3 plays a central role in ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for individuals worldwide. By addressing issues such as maternal and child mortality, infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases, access to healthcare services, and substance abuse, this goal seeks to build resilient and inclusive healthcare systems that leave no one behind. Achieving SDG 3 requires concerted efforts from governments, the private sector, civil society, and international organizations to invest in health infrastructure, strengthen healthcare systems, and promote health education and awareness. Ultimately, the success of SDG 3 will contribute significantly to improving the quality of life for people everywhere and paving the way for sustainable development.
