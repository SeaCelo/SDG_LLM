In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the critical importance of human well-being and health as a driver of global development. The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3, set by the United Nations, is aimed at ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages. As a passionate advocate for evidence-based policy-making, I find SDG 3 resonates deeply with me, as it addresses the multifaceted challenges faced by the global health community and highlights the need for targeted interventions to reduce existing health inequalities.

The first target of SDG 3 is to reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births. Pregnancy and childbirth should be a time of joy and anticipation, but tragically, it remains a high-risk period for many women around the world. Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, in particular, bear the highest burden of maternal deaths. Various factors contribute to these deaths, including inadequate access to quality healthcare, limited awareness about maternal health, and social and cultural norms that can prevent women from seeking timely medical care. To achieve this target, it is crucial to invest in improvements to the healthcare infrastructure, ensure skilled birth attendance, and educate women about their right to healthcare.

The second target addresses neonatal mortality, with a goal to reduce under-five mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births. In 2018 alone, 5.2 million children died before reaching their fifth birthday, with most of these deaths occurring due to preventable causes such as pneumonia, diarrhea, and infectious diseases. To tackle this challenge head-on, we must strengthen primary healthcare systems, improve access to vaccines and quality healthcare facilities, and educate caregivers about child health and nutrition. Evidence from randomized control trials and rigorous empirical studies can be harnessed to identify the most effective interventions to save the lives of these vulnerable young children.

The third target of SDG 3 reflects the urgency to address communicable diseases and epidemics. While significant progress has been made in the fight against diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, global health systems remain vulnerable to new and emerging infectious diseases. The devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is a grim reminder of our collective vulnerability. To achieve this target, we must strengthen disease surveillance, invest in research and development for vaccines and treatments, and build resilient health systems that can respond effectively to public health emergencies. Furthermore, efforts to strengthen healthcare systems must be comprehensive, encompassing both preventive and curative interventions.

Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are a severe public health challenge, with an estimated 41 million deaths occurring annually due to cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases. The fourth target of SDG 3 pledges a one-third reduction in premature mortality from NCDs through prevention and treatment strategies. Reducing this burden requires a combination of targeted interventions, including tobacco control measures, access to affordable medicines, healthy lifestyle promotion, and improved healthcare service delivery. As researchers and policy-makers, it is essential to identify key risk factors and develop context-specific strategies to prioritize prevention and ensure effective management of NCDs.

The final target emphasizes the significance of universal health coverage (UHC) and access to essential healthcare services. Accessible and affordable healthcare services provide a strong underpinning for achieving all health-related targets under SDG 3 and are pivotal in the overall goal of leaving no one behind. UHC ensures that individuals and communities can access necessary health services without suffering financial hardships. Achieving UHC requires sustained investments in healthcare infrastructure, strengthening primary healthcare systems, and embracing innovative solutions. Efforts must be made to protect the most vulnerable populations, including women, children, the elderly, and those living in poverty or remote areas.

SDG 3 embodies an ambitious framework that aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all. As a development economist dedicated to evidence-based policy-making, I recognize the need for comprehensive strategies tailored to the diverse needs and challenges faced by countries across the world. We must harness the power of rigorous research and sustainability-focused innovations to ensure that SDG 3 becomes a reality, leaving no one behind in the quest for good health and well-being. Collaboration, political commitment, and targeted investment in health are indispensable for creating a healthier and more equitable world for generations to come.
