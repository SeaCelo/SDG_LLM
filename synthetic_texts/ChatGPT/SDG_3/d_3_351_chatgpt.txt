Introduction:

This analytical report aims to provide a detailed analysis of Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3): "Ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages". The report has been prepared by the Thailand International Cooperation Agency (TICA) specifically targeting an expert audience. It outlines the current progress, challenges, and future perspectives related to SDG 3.

Overview of SDG 3:
SDG 3 is a crucial goal that focuses on improving global health and well-being. Its main objective is to ensure healthy lives and well-being for individuals of all ages by addressing various aspects of health, including communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases, access to healthcare services, and promotion of mental well-being.

Current Progress:
Since the adoption of SDG 3 in 2015, significant progress has been made globally. The under-five mortality rate has declined, access to essential healthcare services has improved in many regions, and efforts have been made to tackle specific diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis.

Thailand's Efforts:
Thailand has made impressive advancements towards achieving SDG 3. The country's Universal Health Coverage (UHC) scheme has provided access to quality healthcare services for its population, proving to be an exemplary model for other countries. Thailand has also taken initiatives to combat major diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, and dengue fever through prevention, treatment, and awareness campaigns.

Key Challenges:
Despite the progress made, several challenges continue to hinder achieving SDG 3 targets. One of the major challenges is uneven distribution of healthcare services, both within and between countries. This often leads to disparities in health outcomes, with marginalized populations being the most affected. Inadequate infrastructure, health workforce shortage, and lack of financial resources further exacerbate this issue.

Another significant challenge is the rise of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and diabetes. Factors such as unhealthy lifestyles, tobacco and alcohol consumption, and air pollution contribute to the increasing burden of NCDs globally, requiring integrated and multi-sectoral approaches to address them effectively.

COVID-19 Pandemic:
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges to achieving SDG 3. Besides direct health impact, the pandemic has disrupted healthcare systems, caused economic instability, and widened inequalities in accessing healthcare services. It has revealed the vulnerabilities and gaps in preparedness to combat infectious diseases.

Future Perspectives:
To accelerate progress towards SDG 3, several key areas require attention. Firstly, it is crucial to strengthen health systems, particularly in low-income countries, by investments in infrastructure, expanding healthcare workforce, and ensuring sustainable financing. Capacity-building for disease surveillance and early warning systems is vital to prevent and respond to health emergencies effectively.

Secondly, addressing the social determinants of health is essential to reduce health inequities. Governments need to improve access to safe water, sanitation, and nutritious food, while promoting healthy lifestyle choices. This necessitates multi-sectoral collaboration, effective policies, and investments across sectors such as education, environment, and transportation.

Furthermore, proactive measures are needed to address the impact of climate change on health. Rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and emerging infectious diseases pose significant challenges to global health. Strengthening resilience and adapting to climate change in healthcare systems will be crucial for ensuring sustainable health outcomes.

Conclusion:
SDG 3 is a critical global agenda for attaining optimal health and well-being for all. Although progress has been made, challenges persist, and the COVID-19 pandemic has added new complexities. A comprehensive approach that addresses the social, economic, and environmental determinants of health is necessary to achieve SDG 3 targets. Increased global cooperation, resource mobilization, and knowledge sharing are vital for realizing healthy lives and promoting well-being for all. Thailand's experience with its Universal Health Coverage scheme can provide valuable lessons and inspiration for other countries in their pursuit of SDG 3.
