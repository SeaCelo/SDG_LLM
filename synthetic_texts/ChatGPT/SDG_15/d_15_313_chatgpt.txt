Report on Sustainable Development Goal 15: Protect, restore and promote the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, and halt biodiversity loss

Introduction

This report provides an in-depth analysis of the current state and progress towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG 15). As mandated by the United Nations, the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) has been actively supporting various initiatives aimed at protecting, restoring, and sustainably using terrestrial ecosystems, managing forests, combating desertification, reversing land degradation, and preserving biodiversity. This report sheds light on the key challenges, successful interventions, and lessons learned in striving for the targets set under SDG 15.

State of Terrestrial Ecosystems

Terrestrial ecosystems, such as forests, grasslands, and wetlands, provide a range of indispensable services including climate regulation, water purification, soil fertility, and habitats for countless species. However, unsustainable land use practices, urbanization, deforestation, and ecosystem degradation pose significant threats to these valuable ecosystems.

In Canada, notable progress has been made in protecting its diverse socioecological landscapes. The establishment of parks and protected areas has expanded significantly, resulting in greater habitat conservation and biodiversity preservation. Canada has committed to protecting 17% of its terrestrial areas by 2020, and currently, we have achieved nearly 10% coverage. However, challenges persist, particularly in the reconciling  conservation of biodiversity with economic development in resource-dependent regions.

Sustainable Management of Forests

Forests play a crucial role in mitigating climate change, regulating water flows, and providing renewable resources. Canada, with its abundant forest resources, has taken commendable steps towards the sustainable management of its forests. Through programs like Sustainable Forest Management, the Canadian government ensures the responsible use of timber, encourages reforestation efforts, and supports indigenous-led sustainable forest practices.

Despite these efforts, illegal logging and deforestation in other parts of the world have significant environmental and social implications, including loss of biodiversity and increased carbon emissions. CIDA supports global initiatives addressing these challenges, providing technical expertise and financial assistance to improve forest governance, combat illegal logging, and promote sustainable forest management practices in partner countries.

Combatting Desertification and Land Degradation

Desertification and land degradation have severe consequences for food security, livelihoods, and ecosystem functionality. In Canada, our abundant agricultural land undergoes sustainable land-based practices, driven by effective policies, integrated land-use planning, and technological innovation. These strategies promote agricultural resilience, soil conservation, and the adoption of climate-smart practices, enhancing the overall capacity for sustainable land management.

On an international level, CIDA actively supports programs that promote sustainable land management practices and combat desertification. Through capacity building and knowledge-sharing initiatives, CIDA facilitates the adoption of sustainable practices, such as agroforestry, terracing, and techniques for rehabilitating degraded lands, particularly in arid regions.

Preserving Biodiversity

Halting biodiversity loss is a critical component of SDG 15, as vibrant ecosystems are essential for maintaining ecological resilience and sustaining life on Earth. Canada, renowned for its rich biodiversity, has recognized the importance of preserving its natural heritage and has implemented various conservation strategies. Efforts such as endangered species protection, habitat restoration, and scientific research contribute to safeguarding species and maintaining ecosystem services.

At the international level, collaboration with partner countries has helped develop integrated conservation approaches and sharing best practices to protect biodiversity hotspots. CIDA supports initiatives that promote the establishment of sustainable networks of protected areas, strengthen wildlife management frameworks, combat wildlife trafficking, and encourage community-based conservation approaches for socio-ecological sustainability.

Conclusion

In conclusion, substantial progress has been made in many aspects of SDG 15 in Canada and through international collaboration. The efforts towards protecting terrestrial ecosystems, sustainable forest management, combating desertification and land degradation, and preserving biodiversity are notable. However, challenges persist, demanding continued commitment, innovation, and effective policy and planning approaches.

CIDA emphasizes the importance of continued collaboration, knowledge sharing, and capacity building to achieve the targets set under SDG 15. By working collectively, investing in sustainable land management, supporting community-led conservation initiatives, and sharing expertise, we can protect, restore, and promote the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, thereby securing a healthier planet for future generations.
