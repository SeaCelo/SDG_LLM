The Sustainable Development Goal 15, Life on Land, aims to protect, restore, and sustainably manage terrestrial ecosystems, promote sustainable use of forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, and halt biodiversity loss. This analytical report, prepared by the Thailand International Cooperation Agency (TICA), offers an in-depth analysis of the current status of SDG 15 and outlines key initiatives undertaken by Thailand and global partners in working towards achieving the targets.

Terrestrial ecosystems are a vital component of the Earth's natural balance, providing a wide array of ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration, soil fertility, and habitat for diverse plant and animal species. However, unsustainable land practices such as deforestation, overgrazing, and improper land use planning have led to the degradation of these ecosystems. The report highlights that the global movement towards achieving SDG 15 has gained momentum in recent years, with increased national and international efforts towards preservation and restoration.

In Thailand, considerable progress has been made in forest conservation and management, given the government's commitment to sustainable development. The report cites the example of Thailand's approach to forest restoration through initiatives such as the TICA's Community Forest Development Project, which empowers local communities to actively participate in forest protection and restoration activities. By involving the local communities, who are the custodians of the land, this approach has proven to be both efficient and effective.

Additionally, the report showcases Thailand's commitment to combatting desertification and land degradation through the implementation of the Land Resources Management program. Delving into the key initiatives under this program, such as integrated land and water management systems, the report outlines how Thailand has been successful in addressing the issue of land degradation and desertification by promoting sustainable and resilient agricultural practices, and the rehabilitation of degraded and marginal land areas.

While Thailand's efforts in achieving SDG 15 are commendable, the report acknowledges that challenges remain. One of the significant challenges is the domestic and international demand for resources, particularly timber and agricultural products, leading to deforestation and biodiversity loss in some regions. Reducing the consumption and promoting sustainable production patterns are fundamental to addressing this challenge.

Moreover, the report recognizes that achieving SDG 15 requires collective action and international collaboration. Through partnerships with other countries, civil society organizations, and multilateral institutions, Thailand has been actively sharing its experiences, knowledge, and best practices in sustainable land management through platforms such as the ASEAN Working Group on Social Forestry and the Asia-Pacific Forestry Week.

To reinforce the importance of achieving SDG 15, the report presents a comparative analysis between Thailand and other countries in the region, highlighting achievements, shared challenges, and opportunities for mutual learning and collaboration. It also cites examples of other countries that have undertaken successful initiatives in sustainable land management, offering valuable lessons and insights.

In conclusion, this comprehensive analytical report prepared by TICA highlights Thailand's ongoing efforts in achieving SDG 15, focusing on sustainable terrestrial ecosystem management, forest conservation, desertification and land degradation mitigation, and biodiversity protection. Recognizing the importance of international cooperation and knowledge-sharing, the report emphasizes the need for collaboration between countries to address shared challenges. By taking collective action, fostering partnerships, and promoting sustainable practices, progress can be made towards a sustainable future and the ultimate achievement of SDG 15.
