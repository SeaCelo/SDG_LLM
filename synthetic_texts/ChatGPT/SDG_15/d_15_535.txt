Introduction
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations in 2015 provide a comprehensive framework to address global challenges. SDG 15, known as "Life on Land," focuses on the conservation and sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, forests, and biodiversity. This article aims to examine the importance of SDG 15, its targets and indicators, and the main challenges associated with its implementation. It also explores the role of the World Bank in fostering sustainable practices and achieving the SDG 15 targets.

The Importance of SDG 15
SDG 15 is of central importance due to the critical role that terrestrial ecosystems play in providing essential services to both humans and the planet. Forests, for instance, are not only habitats for a significant portion of Earth's biodiversity but also regulate important ecosystem functions such as climate regulation, carbon storage, water purification, and soil fertility maintenance. Moreover, land-based ecosystems are crucial for food production, particularly for millions of rural small-scale farmers worldwide.

Targets and Indicators of SDG 15
SDG 15 encompasses a set of specific targets and indicators designed to guide actions towards sustainable development. The targets emphasize the need for halting deforestation, restoring degraded lands, and conserving biodiversity. For example, Target 15.2 calls for halting deforestation and increasing afforestation and reforestation activities. Meanwhile, Target 15.5 aims to conserve biodiversity through the protection of ecosystems, species, and genetic diversity.

The indicators associated with SDG 15 track progress across various dimensions. These include forest area as a proportion of total land area (Indicator 15.1.1), proportion of terrestrial and freshwater protected areas (Indicator 15.4.1), and the access and benefit-sharing mechanism for genetic resources (Indicator 15.6.1). These indicators provide policymakers and stakeholders with valuable information for monitoring progress and formulating effective strategies.

Challenges and the Role of the World Bank
Despite its significance, implementing SDG 15 faces several challenges. One major obstacle is deforestation driven by various factors, such as illegal logging, unsustainable agricultural practices, and urbanization. This threatens biodiversity and ecosystem stability, exacerbates climate change, and hampers sustainable development efforts. Another challenge is the lack of efficient institutional frameworks and policy coordination to address forest governance and conservation effectively.

The World Bank, as a key global development institution, plays a crucial role in promoting sustainable practices and supporting SDG 15 targets. It provides financial assistance, technical expertise, and policy advice to member countries to improve their forest management practices. The Bank has implemented several initiatives, such as the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility, which supports countries in designing and implementing strategies to reduce deforestation and degradation while enhancing carbon stocks.

The Bank also supports community-driven approaches, recognizing the importance of the participation and empowerment of local communities and indigenous peoples in forest management. It fosters partnerships with governments, civil society organizations, and private entities to enhance forest conservation efforts, promote sustainable agriculture, and ensure the equitable sharing of benefits from forests and biodiversity. Furthermore, the World Bank's research and knowledge dissemination activities contribute to the global understanding of sustainable land management practices.

Conclusion
SDG 15, "Life on Land," highlights the importance of conservation, restoration, and sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, forests, and biodiversity. The achievement of this goal is crucial for addressing climate change, ensuring ecosystem services, and promoting sustainable food production. While various challenges persist, the World Bank plays a key role in supporting member countries' efforts to achieve SDG 15. Through financial assistance, knowledge sharing, and partnerships, the Bank helps countries implement sustainable land management practices and address key drivers of deforestation and degradation. Continued collaborative efforts among governments, international organizations, civil society, and academic institutions are necessary to ensure the successful attainment of SDG 15's targets and the long-term conservation of life on land.
