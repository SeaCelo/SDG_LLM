SDG 15: Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss

Executive Summary:

As experts in sustainable development, Swissaid presents this analytical report on SDG 15, which aims to protect and restore terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, and halt biodiversity loss. The report analyzes the current situation and key challenges related to meeting this goal. It also provides recommendations and best practices that can contribute to the achievement of SDG 15.

Introduction:

SDG 15 acknowledges the importance of terrestrial ecosystems, forests, and biodiversity for human survival and the natural functioning of the planet. This goal addresses the urgent need to combat deforestation, halt land degradation, and prevent biodiversity loss, recognizing that without these essential resources, sustainable development cannot be achieved.

Current Status:

Despite the global commitment established by SDG 15, the current status of terrestrial ecosystems, forests, and biodiversity remains grave. Deforestation continues at an alarming rate, with an estimated 10 million hectares of forest lost each year. Moreover, land degradation affects nearly a quarter of the Earth's land surface, and biodiversity loss persists, with many species facing extinction.

Challenges:

1. Deforestation: Rapid deforestation undermines ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, water regulation, and habitats for wildlife. It is primarily driven by factors such as agriculture expansion, illegal logging, infrastructure development, and climate change.

2. Land degradation: Various factors contribute to land degradation, including unsustainable land management practices, overexploitation of land resources, climate change impacts, and inadequate policies. This poses a significant threat to food security, livelihoods, and ecosystem functioning.

3. Desertification: The expansion of desertified areas poses risks to global food production, water scarcity, and climate change, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. This phenomenon is exacerbated by unsustainable land and water management practices, overgrazing, deforestation, and climate variability.

4. Biodiversity loss: Human activities such as habitat destruction, pollution, invasive species introduction, and over-exploitation of resources accelerate biodiversity loss. This negative trend poses significant risks to the functioning of ecosystems, food security, and the provision of ecosystem services.

Recommendations:

To address these challenges and accelerate progress towards SDG 15, the following recommendations are proposed:

1. Strengthen policy frameworks: National governments should enforce strict regulations and promote sustainable land use practices through legal frameworks and incentives. Synergies with other sustainable development goals should be harnessed, particularly in terms of poverty eradication (SDG 1) and climate action (SDG 13).

2. Promote sustainable land management practices: Holistic approaches to land management, such as agroforestry, sustainable forestry, and restoration activities, should be encouraged. Investing in sustainable agriculture and supporting indigenous and local community land rights can ensure responsible land use practices.

3. Enhance international collaboration: Countries must collaborate at regional and global levels to share knowledge, technologies, and best practices. This collaboration should include capacity building, financial assistance, and technology development to support countries in managing their terrestrial ecosystems sustainably.

4. Increase financial resources: Donor countries and international financial institutions should provide adequate funding for sustainable land management projects and conservation efforts. Innovative financing mechanisms, such as debt-for-nature swaps and impact investing, should be explored to support these initiatives.

Best Practices:

Several countries and organizations have made significant strides in advancing SDG 15. Singapore, for example, has implemented an innovative green infrastructure plan that values urban forests and biodiversity, ensuring a sustainable urban environment. Costa Rica has successfully implemented payment for ecosystem services programs, incentivizing reforestation and forest conservation while generating economic benefits.

Conclusion:

The Sustainable Development Goal 15 is crucial for protecting terrestrial ecosystems, promoting sustainable land management, and conserving biodiversity. However, numerous challenges exist, requiring urgent action and international cooperation. Through the implementation of the recommended actions and the adoption of best practices, we can move closer to achieving SDG 15 and pave the way for a sustainable future for all.
