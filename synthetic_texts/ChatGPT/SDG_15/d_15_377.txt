Introduction:

The Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation ACP-EU (CTA) is pleased to present this detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 15: Life on Land. The goal, explicitly addressing the challenge of protecting, restoring, and promoting sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, aims to halt and reverse land degradation, loss of biodiversity, and deforestation. This report provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of SDG 15, shedding light on key issues, progress, and challenges, and proposes recommendations for future action.

The State of Terrestrial Ecosystems:

Achieving SDG 15 necessitates a clear understanding of the state of terrestrial ecosystems. It is disheartening to observe that since the adoption of the goal in 2015, significant challenges persist. Global deforestation continues at an alarming pace, with an annual net loss of approximately 10 million hectares of forest. Unregulated land use changes, driven by factors such as agriculture expansion and logging, pose a severe threat to the overall health of ecosystems. Additionally, degradation of soil fertility, largely due to unsustainable agricultural practices, exacerbates the loss of arable land and exacerbates food security risks. Furthermore, the alarming decline in biodiversity, primarily caused by habitat destruction, overexploitation, and climate change, puts ecosystems at risk and undermines their capacity to deliver ecosystem services.

Progress and Initiatives:

International efforts supplemented by national and regional initiatives are actively working towards achieving the targets set under SDG 15. Prominent among these endeavors is the Bonn Challenge, a global effort to restore 350 million hectares of degraded and deforested land by 2030. Likewise, the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, developed under the Convention on Biological Diversity, outline a strategic plan for biodiversity conservation across all countries. Furthermore, the REDD+ initiative has gained traction in addressing deforestation and forest degradation by providing financial incentives for developing countries to protect their forest resources. Several countries have also made commendable progress in expanding protected areas, contributing to the conservation of biodiversity and the restoration of degraded ecosystems.

Key Challenges and Gaps:

Despite the various initiatives, several challenges continue to hinder the achievement of SDG 15. One crucial hurdle lies in the insufficient coordination and integration of efforts across various sectors and stakeholders. Achieving sustainable land management practices requires a multi-dimensional approach including the agricultural, environmental, and forestry sectors. Furthermore, inadequate financing and capacity-building pose significant barriers for countries, particularly developing ones, in addressing land degradation effectively. Additional challenges include weak governance and regulatory frameworks, limited technical expertise, and the lack of incentives for sustainable land use practices among stakeholders.

Recommendations for Future Action:

The Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation ACP-EU proposes the following recommendations to overcome these challenges and accelerate progress towards achieving SDG 15:

1. Strengthening Multi-sectoral Collaboration: It is imperative to foster cooperation and coordination among all relevant stakeholders, including government bodies, NGOs, research institutions, and communities. Collaboration at different scales must be enhanced to facilitate the integration of land-use planning, conservation actions, and policy development across sectors.

2. Increasing Financing and Capacity-building Opportunities: Enhancing financial mechanisms by scaling up international investments and channeling funding towards sustainable land management schemes is crucial. Financial support should be complemented by capacity-building initiatives that focus on empowering small-scale farmers, local communities, and relevant institutions with appropriate knowledge and technology.

3. Promoting Sustainable Land Use Practices: Encouraging sustainable land use practices, such as agroforestry and sustainable agriculture, through policy incentives, awareness campaigns, and training programs, can mitigate various issues of land degradation and biodiversity loss. Active engagement of the private sector in sourcing sustainable commodities and promoting responsible supply chains is also essential.

4. Strengthening Governance Mechanisms: Building robust legal frameworks, strengthening land tenure security, and enhancing monitoring and enforcement mechanisms are critical to ensuring sustainable land management practices. National governments should prioritize the integration of SDG 15 targets into their policies and strategies, while international organizations must continue to support and urge the respect of these commitments.

Conclusion:

The Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation ACP-EU recognizes the pressing need for concerted action to address the challenges of SDG 15. Through strengthened collaboration, increased financing, and promotion of sustainable land use practices, it is possible to reverse the alarming trends in land degradation, biodiversity loss, and deforestation. The achievement of SDG 15 is not an option but a global imperative, as the health of terrestrial ecosystems underpins the welfare of both present and future generations. By implementing the recommended actions, we can ensure that life, both on land and beyond, thrives sustainably.
