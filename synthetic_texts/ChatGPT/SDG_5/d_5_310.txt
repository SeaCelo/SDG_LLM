Executive Summary:
This analytical report aims to provide an expert audience with a comprehensive overview of the progress, challenges, and potential solutions regarding Sustainable Development Goal 5 (SDG 5) in Azerbaijan. SDG 5 focuses on achieving gender equality and empowering women and girls. By examining the country's policies, programs, and initiatives, this report explores the accomplishments made so far, identifies remaining barriers, and proposes strategic recommendations for future efforts. 

Analysis:
1. Policy and Legal Framework:
   Azerbaijan has developed a robust policy and legal framework to promote gender equality. The State Program on Gender Equality and the National Action Plan for theWomen's Rights Protection provides a solid foundation for gender mainstreaming in various sectors. The adoption of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and localization of international commitments has also enabled the country to align its legislation and policies with global standards.

2. Education and Economic Empowerment:
   Azerbaijan has made notable progress in promoting education and economic empowerment for women and girls. The gender parity at primary and secondary education levels has been achieved, and efforts to improve access to tertiary education are underway. Additionally, initiatives like the "Youth Entrepreneurship for Sustainable Development" program are increasing the participation of women in economic activities, with a focus on rural areas.

3. Women's Health and Well-being:
   Recognizing the importance of women's health, Azerbaijan has implemented various initiatives to improve healthcare services for women. The Maternal and Child Health program has enhanced access to quality reproductive healthcare services, leading to a decline in maternal and child mortality rates. However, persistent challenges remain, such as limited availability of family planning services in rural areas and inadequate support for women's mental health.

4. Political Representation and Decision-making:
   Despite efforts to enhance women's political participation and representation, Azerbaijan still faces challenges in this area. Although women constitute around 50% of the civil service workforce, they are underrepresented in decision-making positions. There is a need to strengthen women's leadership capacity, address societal gender stereotyping, and undertake targeted measures to increase women's political participation at all levels.

5. Violence Against Women:
   Azerbaijan has taken measures to combat violence against women through legislative reforms, awareness campaigns, and victim support services. Policies such as the Law on the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence and Establishment of State Guarantees, help raise awareness and ensure legal protection for survivors of violence. However, societal attitudes, underreporting, and limited capacity of relevant institutions continue to pose challenges.

Recommendations:
1. Strengthen Implementation Capacity:
   Enhance coordination and capacity of relevant institutions responsible for implementing gender equality policies through training, awareness campaigns, and capacity-building programs.

2. Promote Women's Economic Empowerment:
   Expand access to vocational training programs, financial resources, and business incubators for women. Encourage public-private partnerships to create opportunities for women entrepreneurship, particularly in rural areas.

3. Enhance Women's Political Participation:
   Implement targeted programs and mentorship initiatives to increase representation of women in decision-making positions. Strengthen political party assistance programs to promote gender equality and support women's political participation.

4. Address Cultural and Social Norms:
   Launch comprehensive awareness campaigns targeting communities, media, and educational institutions to challenge gender stereotypes, promote respectful relationships, and actively discourage violence against women.

Conclusion:
While Azerbaijan has made significant progress towards achieving SDG 5, challenges remain in promoting gender equality and empowering women and girls. The government's commitment to addressing gender disparities is evident through their policy commitments and initiatives. However, sustained efforts are needed to address persisting barriers, enhance women's economic empowerment, increase political representation, and combat violence against women. By implementing the recommended strategies, Azerbaijan can move closer to achieving SDG 5 and building a society that truly fosters gender equality and women's empowerment.
