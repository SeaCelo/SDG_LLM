The article asserts that by aligning business practices with SDG 10, companies can become drivers of positive change, advancing towards a more equitable and sustainable future.

1. Introduction:
The UN's adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015 marked a significant framework for global development. SDG 10 stands out in its explicit focus on reducing inequalities, addressing disparities related to income, wealth, gender, nationality, and social inclusion. International businesses play a pivotal role in achieving this goal through responsible practices, inclusive growth, and fostering sustainable economic development.

2. The Role of International Business:
International businesses have become key players in the quest for sustainable development due to their global reach and influence. They possess the capacity to create economic opportunities, transfer technology, and bridge gaps between countries. However, to harness this potential effectively, businesses must not only embrace survival bottom lines but also contribute to societal progress by addressing inequalities.

3. Addressing Income and Wealth Disparities:
Income and wealth inequalities persist globally, both within and among countries. International businesses can contribute to SDG 10 by promoting fair wages, ensuring responsible supply chains, and engaging in equitable wealth distribution. Businesses should endorse living wages, transparent financial reporting, and responsible tax practices to redress such disparities within their operations while encouraging wider industry adoption.

4. Promoting Gender Equality and Inclusion:
Achieving gender equality is a crucial element for SDG 10. Addressing pay gaps, empowering women in leadership roles, and ensuring fair opportunities for all genders are areas where international businesses can make substantial contributions. Adopting gender-inclusive hiring practices, establishing mentorship programs, and developing workplace policies that foster inclusivity are essential steps towards achieving this goal.

5. Mitigating National and Regional Disparities:
International businesses should strive to mitigate inequalities across nations and regions, as economic disparities fuel social tensions and impact sustainable development. Engagement in developmental projects, job creation, and investments in infrastructure and education are ways in which businesses can contribute to addressing these discrepancies. By partnering with governments and local stakeholders, businesses can play a pivotal role in promoting equality.

6. Leveraging Technology and Innovation:
Technology and innovation play significant roles in sustainable development and can contribute to reducing inequalities. They offer opportunities to provide access to quality education, healthcare, and financial services to remote areas. International businesses can help bridge digital divides by supporting technology adoption, investing in startups addressing societal needs, and adopting ethical data practices to safeguard privacy and inclusive access.

7. Collaboration and Knowledge Exchange:
Achieving SDG 10 requires collaboration among various stakeholders. International businesses can contribute through partnerships and knowledge exchange to leverage collective impact. Engaging in initiatives such as knowledge sharing forums, global partnerships for public goods, and industry-wide cooperation can enhance understanding and optimize efforts towards reducing inequalities.

8. Accountability and Reporting:
Effective accountability mechanisms are crucial to monitor progress and ensure the realization of the goals set by SDG 10. Businesses should be accountable for the ethical, social, and environmental impacts of their operations. Transparent reporting, stakeholder engagement, and independent third-party audits can establish trust, draw attention to areas requiring improvement, and encourage course correction towards equitable practices.

9. Best Practices and Success Stories:
This article highlights several inspiring examples of international businesses successfully contributing to SDG 10. Novartis, for instance, commits to donating medicines to developing countries and ensuring access to life-saving treatments for underprivileged populations. Patagonia, a sustainable clothing company, advocates for fair wages and workers' rights in their supply chains. These case studies demonstrate that profitable international businesses can indeed drive social good.

10. Conclusion:
Reducing inequalities and achieving SDG 10 demand collective efforts from governments, civil society, and international businesses. By embracing responsible and inclusive practices, international businesses can meaningfully contribute to addressing income and wealth disparities, promoting gender equality, mitigating regional disparities, leveraging technology, engaging in collaborative initiatives, and embracing accountability. Ensuring a fair and inclusive future requires collaborative actions that harness the power of international business to foster sustainable development and reduce inequalities.
