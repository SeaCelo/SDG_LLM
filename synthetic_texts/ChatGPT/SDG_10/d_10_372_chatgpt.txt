The International Organization for Migration (IOM) is pleased to present this detailed analytical report on the current state of Sustainable Development Goal 10: Reducing Inequalities. As an expert organization in the field of migration, we recognize the crucial role that this SDG plays in addressing the root causes of inequality and fostering inclusivity and social cohesion across the globe.

In recent years, the issue of inequality has increasingly captured the attention of policymakers, academics, and civil society; it has become evident that rising income and wealth disparities pose significant challenges to sustainable development. SDG 10 calls for a comprehensive approach to ensure equality of opportunity and reduce inequalities among individuals and countries. In this report, we will analyze the progress made, challenges faced, and propose recommendations to advance the SDG 10 agenda.

In assessing progress, it is important to highlight that significant strides have been made towards reducing income inequality in some parts of the world. According to recent data, the global Gini coefficient, a widely used indicator to measure income inequality, has shown a slight decrease. This decline can be attributed to improved economic conditions, targeted social policies, and increased awareness of the importance of equity.

However, while these positive trends are encouraging, it is crucial to note that inequalities persist not only in income but also in access to basic services, social inclusion, and political participation. Marginalized groups, such as migrants, refugees, indigenous peoples, and persons with disabilities, continue to face multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, leaving them even further behind. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these inequalities, amplifying pre-existing disparities in access to healthcare, education, and decent work.

Furthermore, inequality is not confined to national borders but also manifests at the global level. Addressing international inequalities in trade, finance, and migration remains a challenge. In particular, an inclusive approach towards safe, orderly, and regular migration is essential for reducing inequalities both within and among countries. Effective and coordinated policies must be implemented to ensure the protection of the rights of migrants, fostering their socio-economic integration.

Within the context of migration and inequalities, it is worth noting that migrants are frequently overrepresented in the informal economy, which often lacks labor protections, leading to precarious working conditions and vulnerability to exploitation. Balancing the need for international labor mobility with ensuring fair working conditions and bridging the income gap is a key challenge that requires careful consideration and comprehensive policy approaches.

In order to advance the SDG 10 agenda, key challenges must be addressed head-on. First and foremost, governments must adopt a multisectoral and human rights-based approach, integrating equality considerations into national development plans and policy frameworks. This entails strengthening social protection systems, providing universal access to quality essential services, investing in education and skill-building programs, promoting gender equality, and eliminating discriminatory laws and practices.

Moreover, partnerships, both at the national and international levels, need to be strengthened to promote knowledge sharing, capacity building, and the mobilization of resources. Collaboration between governments, civil society organizations, academia, and the private sector is essential for comprehensively addressing the complex nature of inequalities.

Finally, addressing existing data gaps and improving the availability and quality of disaggregated data is crucial for evidence-based policy-making and monitoring progress towards SDG 10. Better data collection regarding income distribution, access to essential services, and discrimination will improve the targeting of interventions and ensure that the most vulnerable groups are not left behind.

In conclusion, while progress has been made towards reducing inequalities, there is still a long way to go. It is imperative for governments, international organizations, and civil society to recommit to the spirit of SDG 10 and accelerate efforts to achieve its ambitious targets. By implementing comprehensive and inclusive policies, fostering international cooperation, and ensuring the protection of the rights of migrants, we can move closer to a world where opportunities are offered equally, regardless of one's background or circumstances. Together, we can build a future that respects the fundamental principle of leaving no one behind.
