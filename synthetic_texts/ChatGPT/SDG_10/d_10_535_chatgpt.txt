The World Bank Economic Review (WBER) is pleased to present an in-depth analysis of Sustainable Development Goal 10 (SDG 10), which focuses on reducing inequalities within and among countries. This scholarly article aims to provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of the underlying principles, progress made, challenges faced, and potential pathways for achieving this critical goal.

SDG 10 is a key component of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by United Nations member states in 2015. It recognizes that inequalities in income, wealth, and various forms of social inclusion pose significant obstacles to achieving sustainable development. By explicitly addressing these inequalities, SDG 10 sets forth a vision of a more equitable world where all individuals have equal opportunities to reach their full potential.

One of the primary targets of SDG 10 is to progressively achieve income growth for the bottom 40 percent of the population within each country. This target acknowledges that economic growth, while important, often fails to benefit all segments of society equally. By focusing on the bottom 40 percent, SDG 10 aims to ensure that the benefits of economic progress are shared more inclusively, thus avoiding the perpetuation of systemic inequalities.

To monitor progress towards this target, indicators such as the wealth quintile share of national income and the national minimum wage relative to the poverty line are used. These indicators allow policymakers to assess the distribution of economic resources and determine whether the poorest segments of the population are receiving a fair share of the national wealth.

While progress towards reducing income inequalities has been achieved in some regions and countries, significant challenges persist. Global data reveals that income inequality remains stubbornly high, and disparities continue to widen within and among countries. Factors such as unequal access to education, healthcare, financial services, and productive assets contribute to these persistent inequalities.

Furthermore, SDG 10 recognizes that inequality goes beyond simply income disparities. It encompasses inequalities based on gender, race, ethnicity, disability, and other dimensions of marginalization. Achieving true equality requires addressing these intersecting inequalities, as they often exacerbate each other, resulting in even greater disadvantage for vulnerable populations.

To effectively tackle these multifaceted challenges, a holistic and multi-pronged approach is necessary. The first step lies in implementing progressive tax policies, strengthening social protection systems, and prioritizing investments in education and healthcare. These measures can enhance opportunities for the most marginalized groups and ensure their inclusion in economic, social, and political processes.

Policies and interventions should also address the barriers and discrimination faced by specific groups, including women, youth, indigenous peoples, and persons with disabilities. Gender equality, in particular, is central to achieving SDG 10, with evidence confirming the positive correlation between gender equality and inclusive economic growth. Removing structural barriers, ensuring equal access to resources and opportunities, and promoting women's empowerment must be top priorities in this regard.

Additionally, fostering international cooperation is crucial for addressing inequalities that transcend national borders. Developing countries often face disadvantages in global trade, finance, and technology access, which hinder their efforts to reduce inequalities. Efforts must, therefore, be directed towards creating a more equitable global economic system that supports sustainable development and reduces inequalities at the global level.

In conclusion, SDG 10 represents a seminal commitment to reducing inequalities within and among countries. It acknowledges the multidimensional nature of inequalities, emphasizes the importance of inclusive economic growth, and calls for transformative actions. While progress has been made, persistent inequalities demand intensified efforts from governments, civil society organizations, and international institutions. By ensuring equal opportunities for all and leaving no one behind, we can pave the way for a more just and sustainable world.
