Over the past few decades, the concept of sustainable development has gained immense importance globally, with the United Nations leading efforts in setting goals for creating a better world for all. In pursuit of this objective, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were established, outlining a comprehensive framework to address various challenges faced by humanity. SDG 10 – Reduced Inequalities – holds particular significance, aiming to ensure inclusivity, social equity, and the reduction of inequalities within and among countries.

In Pakistan, a country facing numerous socioeconomic disparities, SDG 10 assumes great importance for policymakers, stakeholders, and development practitioners. This analytical report aims to provide a detailed assessment of the current status of SDG 10 in Pakistan, shedding light on the challenges, progress, and potential strategies that could be adopted to address inequalities effectively.

One of the primary manifestations of inequality in Pakistan is wealth disparity. The top 10% income earners possess significantly more wealth than the bottom 40%. This wealth gap has major implications for access to basic services, education, healthcare, and employment opportunities. Efforts to address this issue have been made through policies such as the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP) which provides financial assistance to vulnerable households. However, despite such initiatives, poverty rates remain high, and the gap between the rich and the poor continues to widen.

Furthermore, gender inequality is a persistent challenge in Pakistan. Women face barriers in accessing education, healthcare, employment, and decision-making positions. The gender wage gap, discriminatory social norms, and limited mobility further exacerbate these inequalities. The government has taken steps to address gender disparities, including legislative measures such as the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act and the recognition of inheritance rights for women. While these policies are commendable, effectively implementing them at grassroots levels remains a challenge.

Education is commonly regarded as a pathway out of poverty. However, in Pakistan, access to quality education is skewed, with children from marginalized communities, rural areas, and low-income households severely disadvantaged. Girls, in particular, face barriers due to social norms and cultural practices. Despite efforts to improve enrollment rates, achievement levels, literacy rates, and the quality of education remain subpar. Targeted interventions such as cash transfer programs, constructions of schools, and awareness campaigns need to be implemented comprehensively to bridge the education gap.

Another critical aspect of addressing inequalities is ensuring social protection and promoting social cohesion. In Pakistan, marginalized communities such as ethnic and religious minorities, people with disabilities, and refugees often face exclusion and discrimination. Discrimination based on caste, religion, and ethnicity continues to persist, impeding national cohesion and social harmony. Policymakers must focus on devising inclusive policies and empowering local communities to promote social cohesion, inclusivity, and reduce discrimination.

Addressing SDG 10 requires a multilateral approach involving increased investment in social sectors, improved governance, and meaningful stakeholder participation. Economic policies need to be designed to reduce inequality and promote equitable growth. Strengthening public institutions, including judiciary and law enforcement agencies, is crucial to ensure access to justice and protection for vulnerable groups. Additionally, harnessing the potential of technology and innovation can support efforts to reduce inequalities by providing opportunities for economic participation and inclusion.

In conclusion, SDG 10 serves as a crucial framework for Pakistan as it tackles the challenges of inequality within and among different segments of society. While progress has been made through various policy measures and programs, there is still a long way to go. Concerted efforts are required to bridge the socioeconomic gap, particularly by addressing wealth disparities, gender inequality, and promoting inclusive education and social protection. By focusing on designing and implementing equitable policies, improving governance, and creating an environment conducive to social cohesion, Pakistan can take significant strides towards achieving SDG 10 and building a more equal society for all its citizens.
