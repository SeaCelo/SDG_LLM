The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11 aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. As an expert environmental organization, Women in Europe for a Common Future (WECF) is uniquely positioned to provide an insightful analysis of the current situation concerning SDG 11.

The goal of SDG 11 is crucial, considering that more than half of the global population resides in cities, and that number continues to grow rapidly. However, the way cities are currently designed and managed poses numerous challenges to achieving sustainability. In this report, we will comprehensively analyze the progress made towards attaining SDG 11 objectives, and identify areas that require further attention and action.

One significant impact of urbanization is the rising demand for housing, infrastructure, and services. While this provides opportunities for economic growth, it also leads to increased pressure on resources and the environment. Therefore, it is paramount to prioritize the development of sustainable and energy-efficient buildings to mitigate the associated footprints on energy consumption, land use, and waste generation. Moreover, buildings should be resilient to changes in climatic conditions and able to withstand natural disasters.

Another central aspect of SDG 11 is the need to enhance public transportation and promote sustainable mobility options. Accessible and efficient public transportation systems not only reduce traffic congestion but also contribute to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. This is particularly important as cities account for a significant percentage of global GHG emissions. The provision of affordable and accessible transportation options, such as cycling infrastructure and integrated public transport networks, can have positive effects on public health, air quality, and social equity.

To create inclusive cities, efforts should be made to ensure equitable distribution of resources, guaranteeing affordable housing, sanitation, and basic services to all residents. No city can be truly sustainable if it perpetuates inequalities and forces communities to live in inadequate conditions. Housing policies should prioritize social housing and consider the needs of vulnerable groups such as women, children, and the elderly. Furthermore, the provision of basic services like clean drinking water, sanitation, and waste management is crucial to protect public health and ensure a decent quality of life for everyone.

Achieving SDG 11 also necessitates safeguarding cultural and natural heritage, urban green spaces, and biodiversity. Preserving cultural heritage promotes a sense of identity and pride among communities, while nature-based solutions such as urban parks and green roofs provide multiple benefits, including climate regulation, water management, and recreational possibilities. Cities need to adopt inclusive and participatory planning processes to value local knowledge and encourage citizen participation in decision-making, thus fostering a strong sense of ownership.

The successful implementation of SDG 11 requires strong governance and multi-stakeholder collaboration at all levels, as well as increased investments and support from the private sector. Local authorities should prioritize sustainable urban development in their policies and regulations and work in close cooperation with civil society organizations, community groups, and academic institutions.

In conclusion, our analysis shows that while progress has been made towards achieving SDG 11, many challenges and opportunities lie ahead. There is a growing recognition of the importance of sustainable urban development, and efforts have been made to incorporate this into national and local plans. However, further commitments, investments, and actions are necessary to transform cities into inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable environments for all. As Women in Europe for a Common Future, we will continue to advocate for gender-responsive and environmentally sustainable urban policies and work towards the realization of SDG 11 for a better future.
