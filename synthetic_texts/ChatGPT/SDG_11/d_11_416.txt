Introduction:
HelpAge International is pleased to present this detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. As an organization dedicated to promoting the well-being and rights of older persons around the world, we have taken a deep interest in the issues reflected within this goal. With an expertise in bridging the gap between governments, civil society, and the aging population, we aim to provide valuable insights and recommendations to an expert audience.

Current Situation:
It is imperative to recognize that urbanization is a dominant global trend, with over half of the world’s population now residing in cities. As urban centers continue to attract individuals seeking economic opportunities and better living conditions, the strain on infrastructures, resources, and social systems grows exponentially. Furthermore, this expansion often leads to exclusion, inequality, and the marginalization of vulnerable groups, including older persons.

The Status of Older Persons:
Within the framework of SDG 11, it is vital to address the specific challenges faced by older persons in urban environments. Age-friendly cities must be cultivated to ensure the inclusion and well-being of this rapidly growing demographic. The aging process should not restrict access to public spaces, healthcare, social services, infrastructure, or economic opportunities. Yet, currently, these critical components are often not designed, planned, or governed with older persons’ needs in mind.

Age-Friendly Cities and Communities:
To ensure the achievement of SDG 11, it is vital to emphasize the importance of developing age-friendly cities and communities. Age-friendliness encompasses a broad spectrum of areas that need prioritized attention and action. Primarily, accessibility and mobility play a significant role in enabling older persons to participate fully in urban living. Equitable and affordable public transportation, pedestrian-friendly streets, and the presence of adequate seating and rest areas in public spaces are key elements to promote inclusive cities.

Safety is another crucial aspect of age-friendly environments. Older persons are often targeted for criminal activities due to perception or vulnerability. Measures to enhance safety include adequate lighting in public spaces, the creation of safe and walkable paths, and the promotion of social cohesion within communities.

Furthermore, accessing and utilizing healthcare facilities should not pose obstacles to older persons. Availability, affordability, and proximity of health services, along with accessibility of information, should be ensured. Additionally, health infrastructure needs to be designed to accommodate the unique needs of older persons, such as reduced physical mobility and chronic health conditions.

Resilience and Sustainability:
Addressing the issue of climate change is indispensable, and urban areas must play a central role in achieving global sustainability agendas. Sustainability should extend beyond environmental concerns and also encompass socio-economic and cultural aspects. Resilience is a key characteristic of sustainable cities, meaning they can adapt to challenges such as natural disasters, population influx, or economic fluctuations.

Older persons are disproportionately affected by natural disasters, especially in urban areas. The effects of such disasters are compounded by limited mobility, sensitivity to temperature extremes, and higher prevalence of chronic conditions. Therefore, urban planning must integrate strategies to enhance the resilience of older persons, including early warning systems, evacuation plans, and the provision of shelter and healthcare specifically tailored to their needs.

Policy Recommendations:
HelpAge International proposes the following policy recommendations to bring about the successful realization of SDG 11 and create age-friendly cities and communities:

1. Include older persons' perspectives in the urban planning process by engaging them actively in decision-making forums.
2. Allocate necessary resources to ensure age-friendly infrastructure, accessible public spaces, and affordable transportation options.
3. Adopt and enforce policies that combat age discrimination and promote inclusion in all dimensions of urban life.
4. Strengthen public healthcare systems to address the unique health needs and challenges faced by older persons.
5. Consolidate efforts between different sectors, such as transportation, urban planning, housing, and social services, to ensure a holistic approach to age-friendly environments.

Conclusion:
As urbanization continues to shape our societies, it is crucial to prioritize the creation of inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities for all age groups. Achieving SDG 11 will not only benefit older persons but will also create socially and economically vibrant cities for all residents. As HelpAge International, we urge key stakeholders and policymakers to take bold and comprehensive actions to address the specific challenges faced by older persons and create age-friendly cities of the future.
