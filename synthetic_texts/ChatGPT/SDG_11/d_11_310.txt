The Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11) aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. As an expert on this subject, I have conducted an in-depth analysis of the current progress towards achieving SDG 11 in Azerbaijan. This report delves into various dimensions of urban development, highlighting challenges and proposing recommendations to steer the country towards sustainable development.

Azerbaijan has witnessed significant urbanization in recent years, with more people migrating from rural to urban areas in search of employment and better opportunities. This rapid urban growth has inevitably led to a multitude of challenges, including increased strain on infrastructure, housing shortages, traffic congestion, environmental degradation, inadequate delivery of public services, and heightened vulnerability to natural disasters.

To address these issues, the Azerbaijan government has undertaken several initiatives and strategies. The State Program on Development of Azerbaijan's Socio-Economic Areas outside Baku envisages the balanced development of regions, aiming to reduce regional disparities and create attractive living conditions for residents. Additionally, Baku, the capital city, has put forth the Baku Development Program with a comprehensive urban development strategy focusing on infrastructure, transportation, housing, and environment.

Despite these efforts, there are still significant obstacles to achieving SDG 11 in Azerbaijan. One key problem is the lack of affordable housing, as high population density continues to exert pressure on the already limited housing stock. Moreover, slums and informal settlements are prevalent in some urban areas, exacerbating issues of poverty, inadequate access to sanitation and basic services, and social exclusion.

Another aspect that requires attention is transportation. Azerbaijan is grappling with rising traffic congestion and insufficient public transportation systems. The proliferation of private vehicles has contributed to air pollution and increased greenhouse gas emissions. Implementing sustainable transport solutions like expanding public transportation networks, promoting non-motorized transportation, and implementing congestion pricing schemes can alleviate this challenge.

Investment in resilient infrastructure is crucial to enhancing the country's ability to withstand and recover from natural disasters. Azerbaijan is susceptible to earthquakes and flooding, and there is a need to incorporate resilient design and land-use planning in urban development projects. This includes strengthening building codes, promoting green infrastructure, implementing flood management strategies, and educating the public on disaster preparedness.

Moreover, there is a need for effective urban governance and inclusive decision-making processes. Empowering local authorities, engaging citizens in urban planning, and fostering partnerships between the government, private sector, and civil society are important steps towards achieving sustainable urban development. The government can also promote social cohesion and inclusivity by integrating marginalized groups, such as internally displaced persons and migrants, into urban development plans.

In conclusion, achieving SDG 11 in Azerbaijan requires multi-faceted and coordinated efforts. The government should prioritize affordable housing, sustainable transportation, resilient infrastructure, and inclusive urban governance. It is crucial to invest in capacity building, promote data-driven decision-making, and foster knowledge exchange and partnerships. By fulfilling these goals, Azerbaijan can pave the way for inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities and human settlements, benefiting both present and future generations.
