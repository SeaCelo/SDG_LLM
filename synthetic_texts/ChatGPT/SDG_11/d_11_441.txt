Introduction
Save the Children is pleased to present this analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11): Sustainable Cities and Communities. This report aims to analyze the current progress, challenges, and recommend possible strategies to further advance SDG 11. The report targets an expert audience and provides a comprehensive overview of the different facets encompassed by this goal.

Current Status of SDG 11
SDG 11, adopted by the United Nations in 2015, seeks to ensure access to affordable, safe, and sustainable human settlement, in particular by focusing on slums and urban areas. It aims to improve urban planning and development in ways that foster inclusivity, safety, resilience, and sustainability. Currently, over half of the global population resides in urban areas, and this is expected to increase to 68% by 2050.

Key Achievements
Despite the considerable challenges addressed in achieving specified targets, there have been substantial advancements in the pursuit of SDG 11. Many countries have made efforts to improve urban planning policies, enhance accessibility to basic services, promote environmentally friendly transport systems, and create inclusive cities. Additionally, efforts to upgrade slums and provide access to decent housing demonstrate improvement in the pursuit of the goal.

Challenges and Constraints
Despite progress, various challenges pose obstacles to the achievement of SDG 11. Rapid urbanization has strained existing infrastructure and services, resulting in gaps in housing, healthcare, education, and transport. Social and economic disparities have grown, with marginalized groups often excluded from benefiting from urban developments. Climate change impacts such as flooding and extreme weather events further complicate efforts to build sustainable cities and communities.

Recommendations
To overcome the challenges and further progress towards SDG 11, Save the Children recommends a multi-faceted approach involving the following strategies:

1. Integration of All Stakeholders: Effective implementation of SDG 11 requires collaboration between national, regional, and local authorities, civil society organizations, community groups, and the private sector. Initiatives should prioritize people's needs, ensuring the participation and inclusion of vulnerable groups, including children and women.

2. Strengthen Urban Planning: Cities must adopt holistic, participatory, and evidence-based urban planning approaches. Investing in land management and efficient spatial planning can help ensure urban growth is sustainable, equitable, and resilient to climate change. Upgrading existing slums should take priority alongside inclusive urban regeneration plans.

3. Enhance Basic Services: Governments and stakeholders should prioritize enhancing access to quality and affordable housing, healthcare, education, and water and sanitation services in urban areas. Infrastructure investments should focus on disadvantaged settlements to reduce inequalities.

4. Promote Sustainable Transport: Encourage the development and implementation of sustainable transport systems that reduce emissions, improve air quality, and prioritize non-motorized transportation. Effective public transport networks and planning for walkability and cycling will improve mobility and accessibility for all.

5. Resilience to Climate Change: Building resilient cities is crucial to mitigating and adapting to the impacts of climate change. Strong emphasis on effective disaster risk reduction, green infrastructure, efficient waste management, and urban tree cover contribute to sustainable, climate-resilient cities.

6. Data and Monitoring: Investment in data collection and monitoring systems is crucial for evidence-based decision-making and monitoring of progress. It enables authorities to assess gaps, track improvements, and effectively align resources for targeted interventions. Monitoring should be inclusive, disaggregated by age, gender, and other relevant variables.

Conclusion
SDG 11 is instrumental in shaping socially inclusive, environmentally sustainable, and resilient cities and communities. Progress towards achieving this goal contributes to broader developmental outcomes, such as poverty eradication, improved health, and reduced inequalities. By adopting the enumerated recommendations, policymakers, civil society, and communities can accelerate efforts to build a more sustainable future, ensuring the well-being of present and future generations in urban areas. Save the Children remains committed to supporting and advocating for the realization of SDG 11.
