Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11) aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. As experts from the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA), we have closely analyzed the current progress and challenges associated with this goal. Through our rigorous research and comprehensive assessment, we have aimed to provide an extensive understanding of the various facets of SDG 11 and its importance for the region.

Cities and urban areas play a significant role in ensuring economic growth, social integration, and environmental sustainability. However, rapid urbanization, inadequate infrastructure, social inequalities, and climate change pose significant challenges in achieving SDG 11. In this report, we will examine these key aspects in relation to the Southern African region and propose strategic interventions for sustainable urban development.

Urbanization in Southern Africa has been on the rise, placing immense pressure on existing urban infrastructures and services. The region is witnessing high levels of informal settlements with limited access to basic amenities, such as water, sanitation, energy, and affordable housing. Moreover, the lack of proper urban planning and management exacerbates social inequalities, leaving marginalized communities vulnerable to poverty, crime, and social exclusion.

One of the critical challenges in achieving sustainable cities and settlements is the inadequate provision of reliable and affordable public transportation systems. Efficient transport systems form the backbone of functioning societies, facilitating economic growth, reducing congestion, and minimizing environmental degradation. However, many cities in Southern Africa are grappling with traffic congestion, outdated infrastructure, and limited accessibility, leading to inefficiencies and increased carbon emissions. In response, investment in sustainable and integrated transportation systems that prioritize public transport, walking, and cycling have become imperative.

Climate change also poses a pressing challenge to SDG 11. Southern Africa is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, such as extreme weather events, rising temperatures, and sea-level rise. These phenomena put immense strains on urban areas, affecting infrastructure, livelihoods, and overall resilience. Therefore, promoting climate-resilient cities and adapting to climate change is indispensable. Development strategies should focus on incorporating climate change considerations into urban planning, integrating green infrastructure and sustainable building practices, and enhancing disaster resilience through early warning systems and proper institutional frameworks.

To address the aforementioned challenges, various initiatives have been undertaken at local, regional, and international levels. Partnerships between governments, development institutions, and private sectors have assumed significant importance to mobilize the necessary resources and expertise. As the Development Bank of Southern Africa, we have played an instrumental role in financing and supporting sustainable urban development projects across the region. These projects encompass a wide range of interventions, such as upgrading informal settlements, expanding renewable energy systems, improving water and sanitation infrastructure, and enhancing urban public spaces.

In conclusion, SDG 11 is critical for the inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable development of cities and human settlements in Southern Africa. Despite the myriad of challenges, significant progress has been made in recent years through collaborative efforts and strategic interventions. However, the journey towards achieving SDG 11 requires sustained commitment, innovative approaches, and continued investment. The Development Bank of Southern Africa remains steadfast in its commitment to supporting and spearheading sustainable urban development, and we encourage other stakeholders to join us in this endeavor for a better future.
