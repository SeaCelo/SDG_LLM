Acknowledgements
This report has been prepared by the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) in collaboration with partner organizations and experts from the region. The data and analysis contained within this report provide a comprehensive overview of the current status, challenges, and progress towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 11.

Introduction
Sustainable Development Goal 11, often referred to as SDG 11, focuses on creating sustainable cities and communities by promoting inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable urbanization. In the Caribbean region, which includes 27 island nations and coastal territories, many cities and communities are facing unique challenges due to their small size, vulnerability to climate change, and high population density.

Urbanization Trends in the Caribbean
The Caribbean region has experienced rapid urbanization over the past few decades, with increasing population and economic activities concentrating in urban areas. This urbanization has led to various positive and negative impacts on the environment, society, and economy. Understanding these trends is essential for formulating effective strategies to promote sustainable urban development.

Environmental Sustainability Challenges
The Caribbean region faces several environmental sustainability challenges in their urban areas. These challenges include vulnerability to natural disasters, such as hurricanes and sea-level rise, inadequate waste management systems, water scarcity, and high energy consumption. Addressing these challenges requires coordinated efforts between policymakers, urban planners, and local communities to promote resilient infrastructure, climate adaptation strategies, renewable energy solutions, and sustainable waste management practices.

Social Inclusion and Urban Equity
Efforts towards achieving sustainable cities and communities must also be accompanied by a strong focus on social inclusion and urban equity. In many Caribbean cities, there are significant disparities in access to essential services, housing, transportation, and infrastructure between different socio-economic groups. Addressing these disparities requires policies and interventions that aim to bridge the gap, such as slum upgrading initiatives, affordable housing schemes, improved public transportation, and inclusive urban planning practices.

Resilient and Safe Cities
The Caribbean, being prone to frequent natural disasters, recognizes the paramount importance of creating resilient and safe cities. Building resilient cities involves integrating climate adaptation measures, risk reduction strategies, and robust infrastructure systems. Additionally, urban safety can be improved through effective urban planning, crime prevention strategies, and community engagement.

Urban Governance and Partnerships
Achieving SDG 11 necessitates strong urban governance structures, institutional frameworks, and multi-stakeholder partnerships. Governments need to prioritize urban planning and development policies that promote sustainability, inclusivity, and resilience. Collaboration between governments, civil society, private sector entities, and academic institutions is fundamental for fostering innovation, knowledge sharing, resource mobilization, and effective implementation of sustainable urban initiatives.

Case studies of Best Practices in the Caribbean
Throughout the Caribbean region, there have been inspiring examples of best practices in sustainable urban development that can serve as models for other cities and countries. For instance, Barbados has successfully implemented renewable energy programs, including widespread solar power generation and energy efficiency measures. The city of Port of Spain in Trinidad and Tobago has initiated policies to revitalize and transform urban spaces, making them more pedestrian-friendly and engaging. These case studies highlight the potential and effectiveness of innovative approaches in achieving SDG 11.

Conclusion and Recommendations
In conclusion, SDG 11 calls for urgent action to achieve sustainable cities and communities in the Caribbean region. Sustainable urban development should address environmental challenges, promote social inclusion and urban equity, enhance resilience, and foster effective governance and partnerships. To achieve these goals, it is crucial that regional governments prioritize urban sustainability in their development agendas, allocate resources for sustainable infrastructure, engage local communities, and foster collaboration between diverse stakeholders.

The Caribbean Development Bank recommends the following actions to advance SDG 11:

1. Develop and implement climate-resilient infrastructure, such as flood-resistant buildings, sea defenses, and green spaces.
2. Enhance waste management systems to promote recycling, efficient resource use, and reduce pollution.
3. Promote renewable energy solutions and improve energy efficiency in urban areas.
4. Implement inclusive urban planning practices that address social inequalities and ensure affordable housing, access to basic services, and transportation for all.
5. Strengthen urban governance structures by implementing mechanisms for citizen participation and clear urban development regulations.

By taking these actions and embracing sustainable urban development, the Caribbean region can pave the way for resilient, inclusive, and environmentally-friendly cities and communities, contributing to the achievement of SDG 11 and creating a better future for generations to come.
