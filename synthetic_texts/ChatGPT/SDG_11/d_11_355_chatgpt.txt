Executive Summary

The African Development Bank (AfDB) is dedicated to promoting sustainable development across the African continent. As part of our commitment, we have conducted a comprehensive analysis of Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11) â€“ "Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable." In this report, we provide an expert review of the current state of SDG 11 in Africa, addressing the major challenges, progress made, and outlining strategic recommendations to achieve the goals outlined within the SDG.

1. Introduction
SDG 11 acknowledges the rapid urbanization witnessed in Africa and recognizes the need for inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities and human settlements. With over half of Africa's population projected to reside in urban areas by 2050, the goal is to ensure adequate housing, basic services, and infrastructure for all while urbanizing sustainably.

2. Analyzing Challenges
Africa faces numerous challenges in achieving SDG 11. Urbanization has outpaced infrastructure growth, leading to inadequate housing, unreliable access to basic services, and overloaded transportation systems. Informal settlements, lacking proper planning and supported by limited resources, further aggravate the problem. Climate change and its associated impacts pose additional risks to human settlements, exacerbating vulnerability and inequality.

3. Progress in Achieving SDG 11
While challenges persist, African countries have made significant strides in advancing SDG 11. Several nations have implemented policies emphasizing urban planning, upgrading informal settlements, promoting sustainable transport, and improving the resilience of cities against climate change impacts. The AfDB has played a pivotal role in supporting innovative projects, such as slum upgrading initiatives in Cameroon and sustainable transport systems in Nigeria.

4. Case Studies
To illustrate progress, we present three case studies from different regions in Africa:

a. Kigali, Rwanda: Kigali's gender-sensitive urban planning and innovative waste management systems have transformed the city into an example of sustainable urban development.

b. Dakar, Senegal: The African Metropolitan Agency of Dakar is implementing a comprehensive urban transport system, integrating non-motorized transport, affordable public transit, and green mobility solutions.

c. Nairobi, Kenya: The Nairobi Slum Upgrading Programme, supported by the AfDB, focuses on improving housing conditions, water and sanitation access, and community empowerment.

5. Recommendations
To accelerate progress towards SDG 11 in Africa, the AfDB proposes the following strategic recommendations:

a. Strengthening institutional capacity: Enhance local governance and strengthen the capacities of urban planning agencies to implement and monitor sustainable urban development policies effectively.

b. Enhancing financing mechanisms: Develop innovative financial instruments and leverage partnerships to mobilize increased investment in sustainable urban infrastructure, including housing, transport, and basic services.

c. Integrating climate change adaptation: Enhance urban resilience by integrating climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies into urban planning, ensuring cities are better prepared for extreme weather events.

d. Securing women's and vulnerable groups' participation: Implement gender-responsive planning approaches, ensuring the inclusion and participation of marginalized social groups in urban development processes.

6. Conclusion
Despite the challenges faced, African countries have made commendable progress in advancing SDG 11. However, sustained efforts and collaboration between governments, development finance institutions, and international partners are crucial to ensure inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities and human settlements for all Africans. The African Development Bank remains committed to supporting African nations in achieving SDG 11 and promoting sustainable urban development throughout the continent.
