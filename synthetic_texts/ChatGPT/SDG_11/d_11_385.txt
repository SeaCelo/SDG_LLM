SDG 11: Making Cities and Human Settlements Inclusive, Safe, Resilient, and Sustainable

I. Introduction

Urbanization is a prevailing global trend, with more than half of the world's population residing in cities. As the global population continues to grow, the significance of sustainable development in creating inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities and human settlements becomes increasingly important. United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) is committed to supporting member states in achieving Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11), which aims to transform cities into sustainable, efficient, and livable spaces. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the current status of SDG 11 and highlights achievable targets for policy-makers.
