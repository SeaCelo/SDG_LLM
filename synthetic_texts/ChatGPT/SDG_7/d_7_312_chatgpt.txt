Report on the Progress of Sustainable Development Goal 7 in Brazil

Agência Brasileira de Cooperação

Introduction:

The Agência Brasileira de Cooperação is pleased to present the analysis on the progress of Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) in Brazil. SDG 7 aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all by the year 2030. This report provides a comprehensive overview of Brazil's current efforts towards achieving SDG 7, analyzing both the challenges faced and the measures taken to address them.

Energy Scenario in Brazil:

Brazil, with its vast territory and diverse energy resources, is among the global leaders in renewable energy production. With a commitment to sustainability, Brazil has made significant strides in diversifying its energy matrix. The country's energy sector primarily relies on renewable sources, such as hydropower, biofuels, and wind power, which account for over 80% of its energy generation.

Progress on SDG 7 in Brazil:

1. Access to Electricity:

Over the past decade, Brazil has made impressive progress in providing access to electricity. As of 2020, nearly 99% of the population had access to electricity, surpassing the national target of universal access. This achievement can be attributed to expansion strategies that prioritize infrastructure development, especially in rural areas. Initiatives such as the "Luz para Todos" (Light for All) program brought electricity to remote communities, contributing to improved living conditions and social inclusion.

2. Renewable Energy:

Brazil's commitment to renewable energy is commendable. The country has made significant investments in hydropower plants, which generate the majority of its electricity. Additionally, Brazil is one of the largest producers of biofuels, with a notable contribution from sugarcane-based ethanol. The country's vast wind potential is also being harnessed, with wind farms being installed in strategic locations. These efforts have been instrumental in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and addressing climate change.

3. Energy Efficiency:

Despite progress made in renewable energy, Brazil faced challenges in energy efficiency, which is critical to achieving SDG 7. Energy-efficiency initiatives have been mainly focused on the industrial sector, where energy consumption is significant. While some Brazilian industries have adopted efficient technologies and practices, more efforts are needed in the residential and transportation sectors, which also account for a substantial portion of energy consumption.

Challenges and Future Actions:

1. Unequal Access and Regional Disparities:

Although the national access to electricity rate is high, challenges remain in ensuring equal access across geographical regions. Remote and marginalized areas, particularly in the Amazon basin, still suffer from limited access to affordable and reliable energy services. Continued efforts must be made through targeted projects and policies to address these disparities and leave no one behind.

2. Aging Infrastructure:

Brazil's infrastructure has faced challenges of aging and inadequate maintenance, affecting the reliability and resilience of the energy supply. Investments for infrastructure modernization and robust maintenance frameworks are necessary to ensure the sustainability of energy systems. Collaborative partnerships, leveraging international expertise and technology transfer, can play a vital role in addressing these challenges.

3. Energy Transition and Innovations:

To further advance SDG 7, Brazil needs to focus on transitioning to even greener and more sustainable energy sources. This requires promoting research and development in renewable technologies, including solar and geothermal energy. Leveraging innovation and adopting cleaner solutions can lead to a more sustainable and resilient energy sector, addressing environmental concerns and supporting economic growth.

Conclusion:

Brazil has made significant progress in achieving SDG 7 by ensuring widespread access to electricity and promoting renewable energy sources. However, challenges such as regional disparities, energy efficiency, and infrastructure improvements remain. The Agência Brasileira de Cooperação emphasizes the importance of continued collaboration, innovation, and targeted interventions to drive Brazil's efforts towards a sustainable, inclusive, and modern energy future. By prioritizing these actions, Brazil can lead by example and contribute significantly towards global efforts of achieving SDG 7 and creating a more sustainable planet for future generations.
