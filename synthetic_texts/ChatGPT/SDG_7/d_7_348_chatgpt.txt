1. Introduction
Access to energy is crucial for economic, social, and environmental progress. However, despite global efforts, over 800 million people still lack access to electricity, and about 2.8 billion people rely on traditional and unhealthy solid fuels for cooking and heating purposes. Goal 7 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) seeks to address these challenges by ensuring affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030. This report provides a detailed analysis of the current status of SDG 7, highlighting achievements, challenges, and the way forward.

2. Progress and Achievements
Considerable progress has been made toward advancing access to energy worldwide. The number of people without electricity access has significantly decreased from 1.2 billion in 2010 to 789 million in 2018, and the global electrification rate has reached 89%. Furthermore, renewable energy capacity has significantly expanded, accounting for approximately one-quarter of the global power system. Investments in renewables have also accelerated, reaching USD 272.9 billion in 2018. Notably, this progress reflects an enhanced focus on the expansion of off-grid solutions, such as decentralized renewable energy sources, mini-grids, and standalone systems.

3. Challenges and Gaps
Despite notable achievements, several challenges and gaps persist. Firstly, the rate of progress in expanding electricity access has slowed in recent years, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where around 573 million people lack electricity. Moreover, efforts to decouple economic growth from energy consumption and promote energy efficiency have been modest and require scaling up to achieve meaningful impact. Additionally, the transition to clean cooking solutions remains a challenge, with over 2.8 billion people still relying on solid fuels, resulting in adverse health effects and environmental pollution.

4. Gender Considerations
Promoting gender equality within the energy sector is of paramount importance. In many communities, women and girls bear the burden of energy poverty, spending a significant portion of their time collecting fuelwood and facing health risks associated with inefficient cooking practices. Empowering women by ensuring their access to modern energy services has positive implications for education, livelihood opportunities, and overall well-being. Moreover, increasing the representation of women in the energy sector can enhance innovation and decision-making processes, contributing to more sustainable and inclusive development.

5. Accelerating Progress
To accelerate progress towards SDG 7, a multi-faceted approach is required. Firstly, improving policy and regulatory frameworks that support investment in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and electrification is crucial. Governments should prioritize designing conducive policy environments, setting ambitious renewable energy targets, and promoting effective public-private partnerships. Moreover, streamlining administrative processes and reducing regulatory barriers can enhance private sector participation and attract investments.

Investments in research and development for new and existing technologies are also paramount. Innovations in energy storage, smart grid systems, and clean cooking solutions can significantly contribute to advancing SDG 7. Furthermore, increasing access to finance, particularly by leveraging public resources to mobilize private investments, is imperative to bridge funding gaps in energy projects. Additionally, strengthening regional and international cooperation can facilitate technology transfer, knowledge sharing, and capacity-building initiatives.

6. Conclusion
Achieving SDG 7 agenda is essential to catalyze holistic sustainable development. While remarkable progress has been made, sustained efforts are required to address critical energy access gaps, enhance energy efficiency, and promote renewable energy deployment. Integrating gender considerations and empowering women within the energy sector must be central to these efforts. By prioritizing investments, refining policy frameworks, and leveraging international cooperation, the world can accelerate progress towards achieving universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. It is only through collective actions and targeted measures that the vision of SDG 7 can be accomplished, bringing about substantial socio-economic and environmental benefits for current and future generations.
