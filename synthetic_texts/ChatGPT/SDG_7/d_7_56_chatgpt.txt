As a prominent advocate for individual liberties and free markets, Brendan O’Neill brings a unique perspective to SDG 7 – ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. In this long academic article, we will delve into O’Neill's views on SDG 7 and explore the potential challenges in achieving this goal.

O’Neill argues that while access to energy is undoubtedly important, the focus on sustainability may hinder progress and exacerbate existing inequalities. He believes that the push for renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, is often motivated by an ideological conviction rather than genuine concern for the welfare of all individuals.

Although the intentions behind renewable energy are noble, O’Neill contends that it is unrealistic to expect every country, particularly those in developing regions, to completely transition to renewable energy sources. He sees imposing such strict standards as a form of moral superiority from wealthier nations, who can afford to invest in renewable energy infrastructure while poorer nations struggle with more immediate needs such as poverty eradication, healthcare, and education.

Moreover, O’Neill points out that the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources introduces a challenge in achieving energy reliability. He argues that the sun doesn't always shine, and the wind doesn't always blow, making it difficult to ensure a constant and dependable supply of energy. Such limitations can lead to power shortages and jeopardize the functioning of critical infrastructure, causing harm to vulnerable communities and individuals.

Another aspect to consider is the cost of sustainable energy transitions. O’Neill contends that renewable energy technologies are often more expensive compared to traditional sources such as coal or natural gas. This can place an undue burden on countries with limited financial resources, leading to further disparity between developed and developing nations. He suggests that instead of solely relying on renewable energy, it would be more practical and cost-effective to invest in clean coal technologies or natural gas, which can serve as bridging fuels until more sustainable options become financially viable worldwide.

O’Neill also addresses the elephant in the room – the environment. He agrees that minimizing negative environmental impacts is crucial, but he raises the concern that focusing too much on renewables without adequate research and technological advancements may lead to unintended consequences. For example, he highlights the environmental impact of producing and disposing of solar panels and wind turbine blades, which also pose a significant challenge for recycling.

In conclusion, Brendan O’Neill takes a critical stance on SDG 7. While he agrees that access to energy is a fundamental human right, he argues that the focus on sustainability may hinder progress and exacerbate inequalities between nations. He suggests that a more nuanced approach is necessary to address the energy needs of both developed and developing countries, including a balanced mix of renewable and traditional energy sources. Ultimately, he urges caution in adopting renewable energy solely for the sake of ideology and warns against potential unintended environmental consequences.
