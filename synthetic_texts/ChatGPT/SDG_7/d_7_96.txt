The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted by the countries of the world in 2015, with the aim of addressing the major challenges faced by humanity and the planet. SDG 7, in particular, focuses on ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. As a leading expert in sustainable development, I am Sunita Narain. In this article, I will delve deep into the significance of SDG 7, its targets, and progress made towards achieving them.

Access to energy is fundamentally essential for human development, as it underpins many aspects of our lives, from poverty eradication to health, education, gender equality, and economic growth. However, today, over 760 million people still lack access to electricity, and billions more lack access to clean cooking fuels and technologies. This lack of energy access perpetuates poverty and exacerbates social inequalities.

SDG 7 addresses the need for inclusive and sustainable energy solutions that leave no one behind. Its targets are ambitious, instead of gradually improving access to clean energy, they aim for "affordable and clean energy" for all by 2030. The range of targets includes expanding renewable energy, increasing energy efficiency, enhancing energy infrastructure, promoting investment in research and development, and strengthening international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy in developing countries.

To advance towards these targets, both developed and developing countries need to take action. Developed countries should provide financial and technological support to developing countries to strengthen their energy systems, promote renewable energy adoption, and transition away from relying on fossil fuels. Furthermore, developing countries need to invest in creating sustainable energy infrastructure and ensure policies and regulations that attract investments in clean energy.

The progress towards achieving SDG 7 has been encouraging, but major challenges still lie ahead. On the positive side, the global renewable energy capacity has more than tripled since 2000, and the cost of renewable technologies such as solar and wind has significantly declined. Many countries, like China, India, and Germany, have demonstrated leadership in adopting renewable energy and have made remarkable strides towards reducing their reliance on fossil fuels.

However, the pace of progress needs to accelerate. Despite the growth of renewable energy, the share of fossil fuels in the global energy mix remains stubbornly high. Many countries still heavily rely on fossil fuels for electricity generation and transport, contributing to air pollution, climate change, and health problems. Transitioning to renewable energy sources requires significant investment, policy reforms, and overcoming technical and political barriers.

Furthermore, ensuring access to clean cooking fuels and technologies to replace traditional biomass, such as solid fuels and open fires, remains a critical challenge. The use of traditional biomass not only contributes to indoor air pollution but also has social, economic, and environmental implications. Transitioning to cleaner cooking options will require tailored solutions that consider cultural and socio-economic contexts, along with investments in infrastructure and awareness campaigns.

The COVID-19 pandemic has also exposed vulnerabilities in energy systems and underscores the importance of SDG 7. Economic downturns, disruptions in global supply chains, and restricted movement have disrupted energy access and threatened progress made in access to clean, affordable, and reliable energy. Therefore, it is crucial to view energy provision through a resilient and sustainable lens to build back better after the pandemic.

In conclusion, SDG 7 plays a vital role in our quest for sustainable development. Access to affordable and clean energy is an essential enabler of multiple SDGs, from poverty alleviation to climate action. Achieving SDG 7 requires collective efforts from all stakeholders, including governments, the private sector, and civil society. It calls for ambitious policies, investments in research and development, and cross-border collaboration to ensure energy access for all. By prioritizing SDG 7, we can pave the way for a future that is sustainable, equitable, and inclusive.
