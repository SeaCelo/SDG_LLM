Renewable Energy: Powering the Sustainable Development Goals

By Josh Thompson

BOSTON - As global temperatures soar and threats posed by climate change become increasingly severe, nations have come to recognize the urgent need for sustainable solutions to secure a greener and brighter future. In line with this mission, the United Nations formulated the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, comprising 17 interconnected objectives aimed at addressing social, economic, and environmental challenges across the globe. SDG 7, in particular, focuses on ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all.

Energy has rightly been described as the lifeblood of modern society, driving progress, stability, and economic growth. But as we forge ahead, it becomes evident that our current energy systems, heavily reliant on fossil fuels, are posing grave challenges for our planet - from air pollution to greenhouse gas emissions. Recognizing this, SDG 7 aims to transform the way we generate and consume energy while ensuring that every individual, everywhere, can enjoy its benefits.

The first target of SDG 7 emphasizes universal access to electricity. Astonishingly, as of 2019, 789 million people around the world are without electricity. This deficiency not only hampers development but also impacts healthcare, education, and economic opportunities. Consequently, achieving universal electrification is of paramount importance. Thankfully, significant progress has already been made. The International Energy Agency reports that access to electricity rapidly improved between 2010 and 2018, with 90% of the global population now covered.

However, providing electricity alone is not sufficient. SDG 7 also calls for a substantial increase in the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. Tied to this is a necessary reduction in reliance on fossil fuels, contributing to both air pollution and the ongoing climate crisis. Renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal, offer a cleaner and more sustainable alternative. Their deployment brings positive environmental benefits by reducing carbon emissions and improving air quality, thus combatting global warming and its damaging consequences.

Investing in renewable energy not only contributes to environmental sustainability but also opens up immense opportunities for economic growth and job creation. The International Renewable Energy Agency reported job growth in the sector, reaching 11.5 million globally in 2019. Embracing renewables presents Boston with a golden opportunity to strengthen its economy, stimulate innovation, and attract investments that pave the way for a cleaner future.

One inspiring example of renewable energy strides lies just off the coast of Cape Cod. The Block Island Wind Farm, consisting of five towering wind turbines, has been successfully providing clean energy to the region since 2016. At its peak capacity of 30 megawatts, the wind farm offsets thousands of metric tons of CO2 emissions annually, demonstrating that offshore wind has large-scale potential to be our energy champion.

To expedite progress within SDG 7, governments, businesses, and local communities must collaborate to ensure policy frameworks that facilitate better renewable energy practices and investments. Initiatives like California's statewide commitment to 100% clean energy by 2045 and Tesla's efforts to revolutionize energy storage with their Powerwall batteries inspire hope and push the boundaries of what is achievable.

Moreover, stakeholder engagement is essential in this transition. Educational campaigns and awareness programs should be implemented to enhance public understanding and to empower individuals to make sustainable choices. Communities can play a vital role by embracing decentralized energy systems and microgrids, thus increasing their resilience and energy independence.

As we stand at this critical juncture, we must recognize the significance of SDG 7 in driving our shared future. Progress toward sustainable energy can amplify efforts in other SDGs, such as eliminating poverty, reducing gender inequalities, and fostering economic prosperity. By investing in renewable energy, we gain not only a cleaner and healthier planet but also a more equitable and sustainable one.

While challenges certainly lie ahead, it is clear that energy lies at the core of our sustainable development journey. Boston, as a city of innovation and resilience, has the opportunity to lead the charge in embracing renewable energy and harnessing a brighter future for its citizens and the world.
