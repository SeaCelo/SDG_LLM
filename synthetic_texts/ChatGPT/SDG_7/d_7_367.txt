Our organization, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), is pleased to present this analytical report examining the progress made towards achieving the seventh Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 7). Our mission is to promote sustainable development to reduce poverty and build shared prosperity by providing financial products, policy advice, and technical assistance to our member countries. As a specialized agency of the United Nations, we are dedicated to improving energy access, affordability, and sustainability across the globe.

SDG 7 calls for "Affordable and Clean Energy" for all, aiming to ensure universal access to reliable, sustainable, and modern energy services, and to substantially increase the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. This goal recognizes energy as a critical enabler for economic growth, poverty reduction, and sustainable development in general. Energy acts as a driver for social development, agricultural productivity, industrialization, and helps mitigate the impacts of climate change.

Our analysis starts by examining access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services. Despite significant progress, approximately 785 million people worldwide still lack access to electricity, primarily concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and the Pacific regions. Moreover, approximately 2.8 billion people rely on traditional biomass for cooking and heating, leading to serious health and environmental hazards. Consequently, achieving universal energy access remains a high priority.

To address this challenge, many countries have embraced innovative solutions. The increasing uptake of off-grid and mini-grid systems, powered by renewable energy sources, has proven effective in reaching remote and underserved communities. Additionally, strategic collaborations between governments, international organizations, and the private sector have fostered impactful improvements in energy access, notably through public-private partnerships.

Turning our attention to the renewable energy sector, the global transition towards cleaner energy sources has gained momentum. Renewable energy capacity has almost quadrupled between 2000 and 2020, demonstrating commendable progress towards increasing the share of renewables in the global energy mix. Initiatives promoting renewable energy, such as feed-in tariffs, tax incentives, and investment facilitation mechanisms, have enhanced investment flows and technology transfer in this sector.

Solar and wind energy, in particular, have witnessed exponential growth due to decreasing costs and favorable investment environments. Many countries, including those previously reliant on fossil fuels, have set ambitious targets to transition to renewable energy.By adopting a diverse portfolio of incentive mechanisms and regulatory frameworks, including auctions and power purchase agreements, they have successfully attracted private investments, energized innovation and promoted technological advancements.

Nevertheless, significant challenges remain. Fossil fuels still contribute heavily to the global energy mix, resulting in adverse environmental and health impacts. Aggressive measures, including the phase-out of inefficient and outdated coal-fired power plants, must be implemented swiftly but prudently to limit atmospheric pollution and combat climate change. Simultaneously, emphasis must be placed on enabling transitions towards renewable energy in developing countries through capacity building, technology transfers, and financial support.

Another key consideration is achieving energy efficiency gains across sectors. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that energy efficiency improvements could deliver 40% of the emissions reductions required to meet climate goals while simultaneously providing other vital socio-economic benefits. Policies promoting energy efficiency retrofits, transitioning to energy-efficient appliances, and adopting energy-saving practices in industries can unleash substantial energy savings.

Particular focus should be given to energy-intensive industries, such as iron and steel, cement, and chemicals, as they contribute significantly to global energy consumption and emissions.Leveraging innovative solutions, such as circular economy approaches and the deployment of advanced technologies, like smart grids and energy storage systems, can yield efficiency gains and reduce energy waste.

While progress has been made towards SDG 7, a multi-dimensional approach is required to achieve energy security, affordability, and sustainability for all. Governments must invest more in renewable energy infrastructure, expand energy access programs, and forge partnerships with the private sector and international organizations for effective implementation. Financing mechanisms, such as green bonds and impact investments, can facilitate the scale-up of sustainable energy projects and help fill existing financial gaps.

Increased collaboration between governments, civil society, and the private sector is necessary to drive policy reforms and unlock financial resources. Strengthening institutional capacities and establishing supportive regulatory environments are also vital components of the transformation. Furthermore, knowledge sharing, technology transfer, and capacity building initiatives should be prioritized to enhance developing countries' capabilities in attaining their energy goals.

In conclusion, tangible progress has been achieved in pursuing SDG 7, "Affordable and Clean Energy." However, several challenges, including energy access, renewable energy promotion, and energy efficiency improvements, need continued attention and concerted efforts. Strategic investments, policy reforms, and international cooperation are necessary to ensure that no individual or community is left behind on the path to sustainable energy for all. The IBRD remains committed to supporting our member countries in their pursuit of SDG 7, as we firmly believe that access to affordable and clean energy lays the foundation for inclusive and sustainable development.
