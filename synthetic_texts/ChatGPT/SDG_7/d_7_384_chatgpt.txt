Executive Summary:

This report aims to analyze the progress made towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. Prepared by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), this report offers a comprehensive examination of the challenges, advancements, and opportunities in the field of energy access for refugees and displaced persons. An expert audience will benefit from the in-depth analysis presented in this report.

Introduction:
Sustainable Development Goal 7 is crucial in advancing the cause of sustainability and improving the living conditions of displaced populations. Adequate access to sustainable energy is essential to meet the energy needs for vital services, enhance security, improve living conditions, and enable socioeconomic prosperity. Under the mandate of providing protection and assistance to refugees, the UNHCR plays a vital role in addressing these challenges.

Methodology:
This report was compiled based on extensive research and data collection from various sources, including surveys conducted in numerous refugee camps and settlements, partnerships with energy providers and governmental agencies, and an analysis of existing literature.

Key Findings:

1. Energy Access for Refugees:
Despite commendable efforts made by UNHCR and its partners, significant challenges persist in providing energy access to refugees. Only about 13% of refugees worldwide have access to electricity through the grid, leaving the majority without a reliable source of power. Renewable energy solutions and decentralized approaches can help overcome this issue and meet the energy needs of displaced communities.

2. Impact on Livelihoods and Education:
Insufficient access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy directly affects the livelihoods and educational opportunities of refugees. Energy poverty inhibits the establishment of income-generating activities, limits access to information and communication technologies, and hampers the provision of education, particularly in refugee camp settings. The expansion of energy services can foster economic empowerment and social inclusion.

3. Sustainable Energy Solutions in Refugee Contexts:
Efforts to provide sustainable energy solutions for refugees have made significant progress in recent years. Renewable energy sources, such as solar energy, offer great potential for meeting the energy needs of refugees. Deployments of solar systems, biogas plants, and efficient cookstoves have demonstrated their efficacy in improving energy access and minimizing environmental impact, saving costs, reducing reliance on traditional fuel sources, and promoting climate resilience.

4. Need for Partnerships and Investment:
Achieving SDG 7 in refugee contexts requires increased partnerships and financial investment. Direct partnerships with governments, national energy providers, and private sector entities can help mobilize funding and technical resources for sustainable energy projects. Innovative financing mechanisms, such as green bonds and impact investment, can also be explored to increase investment in energy infrastructure in humanitarian settings.

Recommendations:

Based on the findings of this report, the following recommendations are proposed to enhance energy access for refugees:

1. Strengthen partnerships: Deepen collaboration between UNHCR, governments, energy providers, and humanitarian organizations to expand the reach of sustainable energy solutions for refugees.

2. Scaling up renewable energy: Increase investments in solar systems, biomass technologies, and energy-efficient solutions to meet the energy needs of displaced populations.

3. Policy advocacy: Advocate for policies that prioritize sustainable energy access for refugees, including the removal of legal and regulatory barriers to decentralize energy solutions.

4. Capacity building: Provide training and capacity building programs for local communities in managing, maintaining, and operating renewable energy systems, empowering them to take ownership of their energy production and distribution.

Conclusion:

Achieving Sustainable Development Goal 7 is indeed a notable challenge in the context of refugees and displaced persons. However, through sustained partnerships, investments, and innovative approaches, it is possible to improve access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. This report highlights the socio-economic benefits of energy access for refugees and underscores the importance of prioritizing their energy needs to protect their well-being, security, and prospects for a better future. By embracing renewable energy solutions, investing in infrastructure, and strengthening collaboration, stakeholders can play a pivotal role in spearheading change towards a more sustainable and inclusive future.
