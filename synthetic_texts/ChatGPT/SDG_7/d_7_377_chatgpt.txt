SDG 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report examines the current progress and challenges of Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) - to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy by 2030. It provides a thorough analysis of key indicators and targets associated with SDG 7 and evaluates the efforts made by various stakeholders in achieving these targets.

INTRODUCTION

As the Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation ACP-EU, we recognize that energy plays a pivotal role in achieving sustainable social, economic, and environmental development. Access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy is vital for poverty eradication, enhancing productivity, promoting industrialization, and combating climate change.

ANALYSIS

1. Universal Access to Electricity:
    - Despite considerable progress, around 759 million people still lack access to electricity globally, with Sub-Saharan Africa accounting for a significant portion. Addressing this disparity necessitates increased investment in infrastructure development, promoting renewable energy sources, and improving policy frameworks supporting electrification efforts.
    - Strategies focused on mini-grid systems, decentralized renewable energy solutions, and partnerships between public and private entities hold promise in increasing access in remote and off-grid areas.

2. Energy Transition and Renewable Sources:
    - Encouragingly, renewable energy's share in the overall global energy mix has steadily increased. However, investments in clean energy are disproportionately low, undermining progress towards sustainable energy systems.
    - Governments, international organizations, and the private sector need to allocate more funding towards renewable energy projects. We also recommend enhancing the deployment of enabling technologies, such as energy storage, to ensure the reliability and stability of renewable energy sources.

3. Energy Efficiency and Conservation:
    - Improving energy efficiency presents immense opportunities for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable development.
    - Technological advancements, coupled with supportive regulations and policies, can enhance energy efficiency in industries, transport, and residential sectors. This would contribute to reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions globally.

4. Access to Clean Cooking Facilities:
    - About 3 billion people still rely on traditional biomass for cooking, resulting in adverse health effects and environmental degradation.
    - Governments and international partners should prioritize the provision of clean cooking solutions, including improved cookstoves and sustainable biomass alternatives, while simultaneously addressing socio-cultural barriers that hinder their adoption.

5. International Cooperation:
    - Collaboration among countries and stakeholders must be scaled up to leverage resources, foster technology transfer, and share best practices.
    - Developed nations should honor their commitments in providing financial support and capacity-building assistance to developing countries to accelerate the transition towards sustainable energy systems.

CONCLUSION

The achievement of SDG 7 is critical for meeting other sustainable development goals and ensuring a prosperous future for all. It calls for a strong commitment from policymakers, increased investment in sustainable infrastructure, technological innovations, and global cooperation. Tangible efforts focused on universal access to electricity, expansion of renewable energy sources, energy efficiency, clean cooking facilities, and international collaboration are instrumental in overcoming the substantial challenges associated with SDG 7.

As the Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation ACP-EU, we recommend that countries place sustainable energy at the center of their development agendas, align policies with the requirements of SDG 7, and promote innovative approaches that integrate all relevant stakeholders for transformative change. Together, through concerted efforts, we can redefine our energy future and build a sustainable and prosperous world for all.
