EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The following report is an analytical assessment of the current state of Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) - Ensure Access to Affordable, Reliable, Sustainable, and Modern Energy for All. This report aims to provide our expert audience with insightful details tackling the progress achieved, existing challenges, and recommendations for addressing the SDG targets. As the Eurasian Development Bank, our commitment lies in encouraging sustainable energy development and enhancing regional cooperation within Eurasia and beyond.

INTRODUCTION

SDG 7 sets ambitious targets to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services, increase the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency, and enhance international cooperation in the energy sector.

PROGRESS REVIEW

Access to energy: While notable advancements have been made in improving access to energy globally, approximately 800 million people still lack electricity, with the majority found in Sub-Saharan Africa and least developed countries. Such disparities highlight the challenges in achieving universal access, particularly in remote or marginalized areas.

Renewable energy adoption: The share of renewable energy in the global energy mix has been increasing steadily, driven by falling costs, policy support, and technological advancements. Notable progress has been observed in areas like wind, solar, and bioenergy, however, insufficient investments and inadequate enabling policies hinder further growth.

Energy efficiency: The increase in global energy efficiency has been positive, but the rate of improvement remains insufficient to meet global goals. Addressing energy inefficiencies in sectors such as buildings, transportation, and industries is essential in achieving sustainability targets.

International cooperation: Collaborative efforts have been witnessed across nations and organizations in fostering international cooperation in the energy sector. Initiatives like technology transfer, capacity building, knowledge sharing, and financial resources mobilization have been pivotal in accelerating progress toward SDG 7.

EXISTING CHALLENGES

Financing the energy transition: One of the significant challenges in achieving SDG 7 is attracting adequate investments. A substantial financing gap exists in both the public and private sectors, hindering the development of affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy solutions.

Energy access in remote areas: While improvements in expanding access have been observed, reaching communities in remote or geographically challenging areas remains a persistent challenge. This is often due to the high cost of extending the electricity grid or lack of alternative off-grid solutions.

Policy and regulatory frameworks: Comprehensive national energy plans, along with supportive policy and regulatory frameworks, are crucial in advancing SDG 7. However, many countries lack clear strategies or face implementation challenges, slowing progress in sustainable energy development.

Technological barriers: Effective technology transfer and innovation play a pivotal role in driving the energy transition. However, technological barriers, such as limited access to clean technology and lack of research and development capacities in developing countries, hinder the advancement of sustainable energy solutions.

RECOMMENDATIONS

Increase investment in sustainable energy: Governments, international financial institutions, and private sector stakeholders should prioritize investments in sustainable energy infrastructure, while leveraging innovative financing mechanisms like green bonds, public-private partnerships, and impact investing.

Strengthen policy and regulatory frameworks: Countries should develop comprehensive, cohesive, and long-term energy plans, backed by supportive policies and regulations. Empowering regulatory agencies and implementing transparent and accountable governance frameworks are crucial steps in attracting investment and achieving sustainable energy goals.

Enhance technological cooperation: Strengthening global cooperation in technology transfer and sharing of best practices is paramount. Developed countries can support developing nations in acquiring clean technology, and partnerships among research institutions, enterprises, and governments can foster innovation and development of energy-efficient solutions.

Promote energy access in remote areas: Governments should incentivize the use of decentralized renewable energy solutions, such as mini-grids and renewable energy technologies, to provide clean energy access to remote communities. Expanding public-private partnerships and exploring innovative business models can help overcome geographical challenges.

CONCLUSION

The progress achieved in SDG 7 demonstrates positive strides toward ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. Nonetheless, several challenges such as financing gaps, policy frameworks, technological barriers, and remote area access still exist. By increasing investments, enhancing policy frameworks, fostering technological cooperation, and promoting energy access in remote areas, we can accelerate progress and promote sustainable energy for a more inclusive and resilient future. The Eurasian Development Bank remains committed to supporting these efforts and looks forward to upcoming collaborations for sustainable development across Eurasia and beyond.
