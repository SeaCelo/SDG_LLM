Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) focuses on ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. As part of the Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA), a global humanitarian organization striving to promote sustainable development, this analytical report provides a detailed analysis of the current state of SDG 7, focusing on its key targets and indicators, challenges, progress made, and necessary actions going forward.

In line with the remarkable growth of the renewable energy sector, SDG 7 aims to enhance energy efficiency and increase the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. To assess progress, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimated that globally, the share of renewable energy in final energy consumption reached around 17.3% in 2019, the last year for which data is available. An increasing number of countries have set renewable energy targets, with some already exceeding their goals. This transition to renewable energy sources contributes to mitigating climate change and promoting sustainable development.

Despite significant progress, challenges remain in achieving universal and sustainable energy access. Sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, has the lowest rate of electricity access, with over 585 million people lacking access to electricity. Rapid urbanization, population growth, and inadequate infrastructure impede progress, primarily in developing regions. In some cases, reaching remote communities with energy services faces logistical and financial barriers, demanding innovative and localized solutions.

Moreover, ensuring energy efficiency and renewable energy in buildings, industries, and transportation systems is crucial to achieving SDG 7. Although energy efficiency policies and technologies are increasingly being adopted, a significant gap exists between current efforts and the necessary level of progress. Resource constraints, technical expertise, and limited access to finance pose major challenges to energy efficiency improvements, necessitating increased global cooperation and investment in green technologies.

To address these challenges, ADRA suggests several key actions:

1. Strengthening Policy Frameworks: Governments and relevant stakeholders should design and implement supportive policies, regulations, and frameworks to encourage investment in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and clean cooking solutions.

2. Increasing Financial Investments: Mobilizing resources, both domestic and international, is essential to bridge the financing gap for energy access projects. Innovative financial and risk-sharing mechanisms should be explored to attract private sector investments.

3. Capacity Development and Awareness: Enhancing the capacity of local institutions, training technical personnel, and raising awareness about sustainable energy options is vital. Collaborative efforts between stakeholders should focus on building technical expertise and empowering local communities.

4. Technology Transfer and Innovation: Facilitating the transfer of affordable and clean energy technologies to developing countries is crucial. Encouraging knowledge sharing, research collaboration, and promoting innovation in energy solutions will aid in overcoming technological barriers.

5. Engaging Multilateral Cooperation: International organizations, such as the United Nations and other development agencies, must strengthen collaboration to share best practices, coordinate efforts, and support initiatives towards achieving SDG 7.

In conclusion, while progress has been made towards achieving SDG 7, significant challenges remain. ADRA recognizes the importance of ensuring access to clean, affordable, and sustainable energy for all. Through concrete actions such as strengthening policy frameworks, increasing financial investments, capacity development, technology transfer, and engaging multilateral cooperation, we can accelerate progress towards a world where energy poverty is alleviated, and sustainable energy services are accessible to all. ADRA remains committed to working with global partners to achieve SDG 7 and contribute to a more sustainable future.
