In accordance with the mandate of the Federal Agency for the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) to monitor and analyze progress towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), this report provides a detailed and comprehensive analysis of SDG 7 - Affordable and Clean Energy. The purpose of this report is to assess the Regionâ€™s current status in regards to this specific goal, highlight key challenges and opportunities, and propose actionable strategies for the realization of SDG 7 in the CIS context.

SDG 7 aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. It recognizes that energy is a crucial enabler for social and economic development as well as an integral pillar of sustainable growth. To achieve this overarching target, SDG 7 sets forth three specific targets:

1. By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services.
2. By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix.
3. By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency.

In evaluating the CIS's progress towards SDG 7, it is essential to consider the Region's unique characteristics and challenges. The CIS comprises eleven member states, encompassing a significant portion of Eurasia, and is composed of countries at different stages of economic development and with varied energy profiles.

Current energy access in the CIS region is uneven, with a substantial urban-rural divide. Urban areas generally have easier access to reliable and modern energy services than rural ones. To address this disparity, member states need to strengthen infrastructure and improve grid connectivity in the rural and remote regions. Initiatives such as investment in renewable energy technologies, expansion of mini-grids and off-grid solutions, and establishing public-private partnerships can be instrumental in accelerating progress.

The CIS region has substantial human and natural resources for generating renewable energy. This, coupled with increasing concerns about climate change and energy security, offers an opportunity for member states to significantly increase their share of renewable energy in the energy mix. However, several barriers need to be addressed to unlock the full potential of renewable energy in the region. These include policy and regulatory frameworks, limited access to finance, technology transfer and capacity building needs, and balancing renewable energy integration with conventional energy sources.

Energy efficiency holds great promise in mitigating the environmental impact of energy consumption while fostering economic growth. The CIS region has significant potential to improve energy efficiency in various sectors such as industry, buildings, and transportation. Strategies to promote energy-efficient technologies, energy audits, and energy management systems, as well as raising awareness about the benefits of energy efficiency, should be key priorities for member states.

In order to accelerate progress towards the targets defined by SDG 7 in CIS member states, coordination and collaboration between different stakeholders are essential. This includes national governments, international organizations, development partners, civil society, and the private sector. Aligning national energy policies with the principles of sustainable development, establishing favorable investment frameworks and removing regulatory barriers f
