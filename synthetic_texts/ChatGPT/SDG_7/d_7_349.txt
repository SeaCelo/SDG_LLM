The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) is pleased to present this analytical report highlighting the current progress and challenges associated with Sustainable Development Goal 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. This report examines the global situation, existing gaps, and potential solutions within the context of SDG 7.

Energy forms the backbone of modern society, playing a pivotal role in economic growth, social development, and poverty eradication. Yet, as of today, approximately 789 million people still lack access to electricity, while nearly 2.8 billion depend on solid fuels for cooking and heating. Insufficient energy access disproportionately affects marginalized communities, hindering their ability to build resilient livelihoods, attain quality education, and access essential healthcare services.

To address these challenges, SDG 7 aims to ensure universal access to reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy sources. The prioritization of renewable energy and energy efficiency is central to meeting this goal, as they present opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, combat climate change, and promote sustainable development.

While substantial progress has been made, particularly through the expansion of renewable energy sources, the global pace of advancement towards SDG 7 has been uneven. Developed regions such as Europe and North America witness high rates of electrification, with renewable energy integration performing considerably well. However, several developing regions, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, still face significant energy access deficits due to limited infrastructure, geographical challenges, and funding gaps.

One of the key impediments to achieving SDG 7 is financing. Estimates indicate that an annual investment of $40 to $55 billion is required to expand electricity access to all by 2030, along with significant investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency. Mobilizing sufficient financial resources, both public and private, is crucial to bridge this funding gap.

Additionally, policy and regulatory frameworks play an instrumental role in fostering an enabling environment for sustainable energy. Countries need to develop clear energy strategies, implement effective governance mechanisms, and encourage private sector participation through fiscal incentives and de-risking measures. Regulatory frameworks must strike a balance between promoting renewable energy deployment while ensuring grid stability.

Greater emphasis must also be placed on technology transfer and capacity-building efforts. Developing countries, while rich in renewable energy potential, often lack the necessary technical expertise and infrastructure to deploy and integrate renewable energy effectively. Initiatives should focus on promoting knowledge exchange, providing training programs, and developing local capacities to accelerate the adoption of sustainable energy solutions.

Furthermore, the role of partnerships and multi-stakeholder collaborations cannot be understated in achieving SDG 7. Cooperation between governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector is essential to leverage synergies, share best practices, scale up successful models, and address systemic barriers.

Switzerland, as a prominent advocate for sustainable development, has been actively promoting the agenda set by SDG 7. Embarking on various initiatives, Switzerland emphasizes its commitment to promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency both domestically and internationally. Swiss development projects prioritize sustainable and inclusive energy access, technological innovation, capacity-building, and the strengthening of policy and regulatory frameworks in partner countries.

In conclusion, the journey towards achieving SDG 7 demands a collective and concerted effort from all stakeholders. The current analysis emphasizes the need for sustained investment, policy reform, technology transfer, and enhanced partnerships to ensure universal access to clean, reliable, and affordable energy. The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation is firmly committed to working towards this noble goal by supporting initiatives that promote sustainable energy access, share knowledge and experience, and build the capacities of countries striving for a brighter and cleaner energy future.
