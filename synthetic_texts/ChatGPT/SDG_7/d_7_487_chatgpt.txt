Millions of people around the world still live without access to clean, reliable, and affordable energy. This is a harsh reality that undermines progress in numerous aspects of life, from healthcare to education, and economic growth to sustainable development. Recognizing the urgent need to address this issue, the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have set a comprehensive plan to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services by 2030 under SDG 7.

SDG 7, also known as "Affordable and Clean Energy," serves as a steadfast commitment to addressing the energy crisis and its wide-reaching impacts. This goal goes beyond ensuring access to electricity; it also focuses on making certain that energy systems are sustainable, increasing the share of renewable energy, improving energy efficiency, and promoting energy research and innovation.

India, with its booming population and growing economy, faces its own set of challenges when it comes to energy. As one of the largest energy consumers globally, the country grapples with dwindling conventional energy sources and the environmental toll they exact. To curb the adverse effects of energy production and consumption, India has been at the forefront of embracing alternative energy sources and embracing the principles outlined in SDG 7.

One significant initiative taken by India is the increased focus on renewable energy. The country has set an ambitious target of reaching 175 GW of renewable energy by 2022, including 100 GW of solar energy and 60 GW of wind energy. It has made significant headway in achieving these targets, with India's cumulative renewable energy capacity already exceeding 134 GW as of August 2021. These efforts not only contribute to energy security but also reduce greenhouse gas emissions, mitigating the impact of climate change.

Furthermore, the Government of India has been proactive in ensuring energy access for all through various schemes and programs. The Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana, also known as the 'Saubhagya' scheme, aims to provide electricity connections to all un-electrified households in rural and urban areas. This initiative has been instrumental in bridging the urban-rural divide when it comes to access to electricity, uplifting marginalized communities, improving healthcare services, and enhancing educational opportunities.

On the urban front, initiatives like the Smart Cities Mission promote energy efficiency, renewable energy, and sustainable transport as pillars. With the goal of developing 100 smart cities across the country, this mission incorporates technology-driven solutions and innovation to ensure smarter and sustainable urban development. Intelligent energy management systems, efficient waste management, and smart grids are some of the critical components of this endeavour.

However, while commendable progress has been made, India still faces challenges in achieving SDG 7. Approximately 200 million people in the country still lack access to electricity, primarily in the remote and marginalized areas. There is a need to address variations in power supply, reduce transmission losses, and improve the overall efficiency of the energy sector.

To accelerate progress, a collaborative effort between the government, private sector, civil society, and international institutions is crucial. Concerted investment and support for research and development will help advance technologies and spur innovations in clean energy, ultimately driving the achievement of SDG 7.

Furthermore, encouraging financial incentives and favorable policy environments can help attract private investment in the renewable energy sector, leading to job creation, economic growth, and sustainable development. Governments should also promote public awareness on energy conservation, encourage responsible energy consumption practices, and prioritize climate action to catalyze the transition towards a sustainable energy future.

SDG 7 represents a transformative opportunity to create a world where energy is affordable, clean, and accessible to all. India, as a global leader in sustainable energy, has made commendable strides towards this goal. However, there is still much work to be done. By embracing innovative technologies, fostering collaboration, and inspiring a collective commitment, we can ensure a future where energy is a catalyst for progress, prosperity, and a sustainable planet.
