Introduction

The Sustainable Sanitation Alliance (SuSanA) is pleased to present this analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. This report is aimed at an expert audience, and its objective is to provide a detailed analysis of the current status of SDG 7, highlighting key challenges, trends, and opportunities. 

Overview of SDG 7 

SDG 7 is a critical component of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It seeks to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy throughout the world, while also promoting energy efficiency and the increased use of renewable energy sources. This goal recognizes the fundamental role of energy in all aspects of human development, addressing not only access to electricity but also clean cooking solutions, heating, and transportation.

Current status and challenges

1. Access to modern energy: Despite significant progress made in expanding access to electricity, around 789 million people globally still lack basic access. In sub-Saharan Africa, almost two-thirds of the population lacks electricity, posing a severe challenge to achieving SDG 7. Development efforts must prioritize investments in infrastructure, capacity building, and appropriate regulatory frameworks to accelerate progress in areas with laggard progress.

2. Renewable energy uptake: Increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix is crucial for sustainable development. Whilst considerable progress has been made, renewable energy sources accounted for only 17.3% of total global energy consumption in 2018. Many barriers hinder a more rapid transition to renewable energy, including policy and regulatory gaps, inadequate financing mechanisms, and resistance from vested interests in the fossil fuel industry. Addressing these barriers is vital to harnessing the benefits of renewable energy for SDG 7.

3. Energy efficiency: Energy efficiency represents a significant opportunity for reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. However, progress in this area remains insufficient. Many countries lack effective policies and regulations to promote energy efficiency, resulting in wasteful practices across various sectors, including buildings, industry, transport, and agriculture. Policies must be developed to incentivize energy-efficient technologies and practices, supported by public awareness campaigns and capacity building.

4. Clean cooking solutions: Access to clean cooking solutions is an urgent concern, particularly in low-income countries. Approximately 2.8 billion people globally continue to rely on traditional biomass and pollutant-emitting stoves for cooking, causing adverse health effects and contributing to deforestation and climate change. Achieving universal access to clean cooking solutions requires investments in research and development, the provision of affordable and efficient cookstoves, and stronger collaboration between stakeholders.

5. Energy in the transport sector: Transportation accounts for a significant portion of global energy consumption and is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Transitioning towards low-carbon transport systems presents a crucial challenge. Innovative policy measures, such as incentivizing electric vehicle adoption, promoting public transport, and encouraging pedestrian and cycling infrastructure, can help steer the transportation sector towards sustainability. The role of advanced technologies, such as hydrogen fuel cells, also needs to be explored.

Opportunities for progress

1. Strengthening international cooperation: Addressing the challenges faced by SDG 7 necessitates enhanced international cooperation, capacity building, and knowledge sharing. This includes facilitating technology transfer, fostering public-private partnerships, and supporting developing countries through appropriate financing mechanisms.

2. Advancing renewable energy technologies: Continual innovation and deployment of renewable energy technologies are pivotal in achieving SDG 7. Policymakers and stakeholders need to support research and development, create enabling environments for private sector participation, and facilitate the adoption of renewable energy solutions that are viable, scalable, and affordable.

3. Strengthening energy governance: Governance structures at global, regional, national, and local levels play a crucial role in transitioning to sustainable energy systems. Policymakers should prioritize strengthening institutions, fostering transparency and accountability, and integrating energy planning with other sectors to ensure coherent and impactful decision-making processes.

4. Empowering local communities: Ensuring the success of SDG 7 requires empowering local communities, particularly those in underserved areas, to participate actively in sustainable energy initiatives. Community-led renewable energy projects, capacity building, and awareness-raising campaigns can all contribute to enhanced local ownership and sustainability.

Conclusion

SDG 7 is vital for creating a sustainable and inclusive world. Progress in achieving universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy requires addressing key challenges and seizing opportunities. By strengthening international cooperation, promoting renewable energy technologies, fostering good governance practices, and empowering local communities, we can accelerate progress towards SDG 7 and build a future where everyone has access to clean, affordable, and reliable energy. With concerted efforts and collaboration, we can pave the way for a truly sustainable energy future.
