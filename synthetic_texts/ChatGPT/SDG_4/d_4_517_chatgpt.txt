Moreover, firms partnering with educational institutions need to navigate the complexities of coordinating and implementing collaborative initiatives that uphold the principles of social inclusivity and sustainable development.

5. Conclusion:
As organizations increasingly recognize the importance of social and environmental sustainability in their strategic management practices, SDG 4 provides a framework to incorporate quality education as a crucial element. The current strategic management literature emphasizes the strategic advantages of proactively aligning with SDGs, demonstrating the potential role of quality education in fostering innovation, competitiveness, and societal progress.
