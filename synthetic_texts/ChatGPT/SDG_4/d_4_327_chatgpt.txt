The Israeli government is deeply committed to promoting global economic growth, social inclusivity, and environmental sustainability through supporting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This report, prepared by the Israel Agency for International Development Cooperation (MASHAV), focuses on SDG 4: Quality Education. SDG 4 strives to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education for all, including improving access to education, enhancing learning outcomes, and boosting lifelong learning opportunities. This report will provide a detailed analysis of the current state of SDG 4, highlighting Israel's efforts towards achieving the targets and suggesting innovative strategies for progress.

Access to education remains a key challenge in many parts of the world, particularly in developing countries and regions affected by conflict and humanitarian crises. According to UNESCO's Education for All Global Monitoring Report, there are still 258 million children and adolescents out of school worldwide, with 617 million lacking foundational literacy and numeracy skills. It is essential to address this issue head-on to achieve SDG 4.

Israel recognizes the importance of education and has made significant strides in ensuring access to quality education for all. The government has implemented policies that prioritize education, resulting in a high literacy rate and academic excellence. As early as the 1960s, Israel developed MASHAV programs that focused on education, training teachers, and opening doors to education for marginalized populations. These initiatives have expanded over the years, contributing to the success of SDG 4.

One notable example is MASHAV's Early Childhood Care and Education program in Ethiopia. This project trains local Ethiopian educators in strategies to enhance early childhood education while promoting social inclusion and parent engagement. By investing in early childhood education, Israel helps to mitigate learning disparities and create a strong foundation for lifelong learning.

In addition to promoting access, improving learning outcomes is fundamental in addressing SDG 4. Enhancing teaching skills, fostering innovation, and developing suitable curricula are all crucial components in this regard. Israel has excelled in these areas, and its expertise is shared with partners around the world.

An exemplary MASHAV initiative, the International Education and Resource Network (iEARN), enables teachers and students worldwide to engage in collaborative online projects. This innovative platform facilitates the exchange of ideas, promotes digital literacy, and strengthens cross-cultural understanding. Through partnerships with iEARN, Israel promotes quality education beyond its borders, sharing valuable experiences and best practices.

Lifelong learning is another key aspect of SDG 4. In today's rapidly changing world, ensuring that individuals have access to continuous learning opportunities is essential. Israel recognizes the importance of lifelong learning and continually supports initiatives that promote vocational training and adult education. MASHAV's expertise in this area has been shared through numerous projects, such as its partnership with the Pan African Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou (FESPACO) in Burkina Faso. This collaboration aims to strengthen the local film industry by providing vocational training opportunities for aspiring filmmakers and technicians.

To further enhance SDG 4, innovation becomes a critical factor. Israel's renowned technological advancements and start-up culture offer valuable insights in this regard. Integrating technology into education, developing digital learning resources, and promoting entrepreneurship education are all avenues to explore.

The MASHAV pilot program, EdTech Exchange, exemplifies Israel's dedication to innovation in education. By bringing together edtech entrepreneurs and educators from across the globe, this program fosters meaningful collaborations, creating cutting-edge solutions to educational challenges. Through initiatives like EdTech Exchange, Israel contributes to the advancement of SDG 4 by pioneering new methods of enhancing quality education.

While Israel has made commendable progress towards SDG 4, challenges persist and require collective efforts for further improvement. MASHAV continues to engage in various partnerships, sharing its experiences and learning from others to address these challenges creatively and effectively.

In conclusion, Israel's commitment to SDG 4: Quality Education is deeply embedded in the policies and initiatives driven by the MASHAV. Through targeted programs for access, learning outcomes, and lifelong learning, Israel strives to make quality education universally accessible and conducive to economic and social development. By sharing its expertise and innovative approaches, Israel contributes significantly to the global efforts in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly SDG 4. Together with its partners, Israel remains committed to leaving no one behind in the pursuit of quality education for all.
