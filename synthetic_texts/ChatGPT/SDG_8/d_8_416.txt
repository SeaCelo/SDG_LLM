The Current State of SDG 8: Promoting Sustainable Economic Growth and Decent Work for All

Introduction:
With the global population aging at an unprecedented rate, it is imperative to analyze and address the challenges faced by older people in accessing decent work opportunities and achieving sustainable economic growth. This report by Helpage International focuses on providing an analytical perspective on SDG 8 - Promoting sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all. It presents a comprehensive examination of the current state of SDG 8 implementation, identifying key progress and setbacks, and proposing pragmatic recommendations to ensure that older people are fully integrated into this global development framework.

Context:
SDG 8 seeks to provide a blueprint for nations to foster inclusive and sustainable economic growth, while ensuring decent work opportunities for all, irrespective of age. It strives to address the persisting challenges of unemployment, underemployment, discrimination in labor markets, and inequality of working conditions. It calls for policies promoting job creation, entrepreneurship, global cooperation, labor rights, and social protections, interspersed with environmental sustainability.

Progress and Achievements:
Since the adoption of the SDGs in 2015, diverse efforts have been undertaken worldwide to advance economic growth and decent work. Several countries have recorded significant achievements, such as reducing the overall unemployment rate, expanding entrepreneurship opportunities, enhancing labor productivity, and narrowing the gender wage gap.

Many governments have adopted inclusive policies to combat age discrimination and to facilitate opportunities for older workers. Belgium, for instance, reimplemented measures allowing older workers to switch to part-time employment while retaining a portion of their pension schemes, resulting in reduced unemployment rates and better working conditions for older individuals.

Furthermore, a growing awareness of the importance of lifelong learning has led to the creation of initiatives targeting skills development, career transition support, and mentoring for older workers. The Netherlands pioneered the well-regarded 'PlusPact' program, which provides tailored training and entrepreneurship support for individuals aged 50 and above, leading to increased employment options and encouraged contributions from older workers.

Challenges and Setbacks:
Despite these positive developments, significant challenges persist in the realization of SDG 8, specifically in regards to older people. Ageism and stereotypes against older workers continue to hinder their meaningful participation in the workforce. Workplace discrimination may manifest in various forms, such as limited career progression prospects, unequal pay, reduced access to training opportunities, or premature exit from employment due to age-based assumptions.

Moreover, unemployment among older individuals remains a daunting issue in many parts of the world. Workers approaching retirement age may face challenges in finding new employment or remaining active in the job market for financial security. This is especially concerning in the context of an aging global population, as it underutilizes the valuable skills and knowledge older individuals possess, resulting in a waste of human capital.

Recommendations:
To address these challenges and accelerate towards achieving SDG 8, several multi-dimensional recommendations can be put forth:

1. Strengthening legal frameworks and policies: Governments must bolster existing legislation that guarantees equal opportunities for people of all ages. This includes addressing ageism, promoting non-discriminatory hiring practices, adopting age-friendly work environments, and safeguarding labor rights.

2. Enhancing social protection and pensions: Adequate and sustainable social protection programs and pension schemes should be developed to bolster older people's economic security, thereby encouraging continued workforce engagement and reducing poverty rates among this group.

3. Promoting lifelong learning initiatives: By investing in targeted training programs and reskilling opportunities for older workers, countries can empower individuals to maneuver labor markets and capitalize on their potential, fostering their inclusion in the workforce.

4. Encouraging age-inclusive entrepreneurship: Entrepreneurship can provide opportunities for older individuals to actively participate in economic development. Governments should support initiatives that foster and mentor senior entrepreneurship, allowing older people to leverage their expertise, skills, and experiences to contribute to sustainable economic growth.

Conclusion:
In order to effectively achieve SDG 8, it is crucial for governments, policymakers, and relevant stakeholders to recognize the significant contributions aging populations can make to economic growth and development. Upholding the principles of inclusivity, non-discrimination, and equal opportunities for older workers should be at the forefront of global policy agendas. By implementing the recommendations outlined in this report, stakeholders can usher in an era of sustainable economic growth and decent work for all, heralding an equitable and prosperous future for both younger and older generations alike.
