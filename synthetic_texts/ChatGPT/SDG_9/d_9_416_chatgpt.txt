The Sustainable Development Goal 9 (SDG 9) aims to build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation. As a leading global network advocating for the rights and well-being of older people, Helpage International recognizes the importance of SDG 9 in fostering an environment that ensures older persons are not left behind in the process of development and innovation.

Infrastructure plays a crucial role in supporting economic growth and promoting sustainable development. However, older persons often face several challenges when it comes to accessing infrastructure and services. Aging infrastructure deteriorates rapidly, leading to inadequate or inaccessible transportation, water supply, and healthcare facilities. This lack of infrastructure affects the overall well-being and quality of life for older people.

To address these challenges, Helpage International has been working closely with governments, partners, and local communities to promote sustainable infrastructure development that takes into consideration the needs of older persons. By advocating for age-friendly design principles, we strive to ensure that new infrastructure projects do not exclude or discriminate against older people. This includes accessible public transportation systems, age-friendly healthcare facilities, and suitable housing options that promote independent living.

Additionally, SDG 9 recognizes the importance of inclusive and sustainable industrialization, which can contribute to job creation, economic growth, and technological advancements. However, older persons often face age-related barriers to employment and may be disproportionately affected by changes in industries due to automation and digitalization. Helpage International supports the inclusion of older workers in the labor market, promoting age-friendly workplaces, and providing training and re-skilling opportunities to ensure their continued participation.

Furthermore, fostering innovation is key in driving sustainable development. Technological advancements have the potential to address social and economic challenges faced by older persons. Helpage International innovates through the use of digital technologies, creating platforms and tools that facilitate access to essential services and social connections for older people. By harnessing the power of innovation and technology, we aim to bridge the digital divide that older persons often face, ensuring they can fully participate in the digital era.

In order to effectively address the goals of SDG 9, collaboration between governments, civil society organizations, and private sectors is essential. Helpage International actively engages with various stakeholders to advocate for policies and practices that prioritize the needs and rights of older people in infrastructure development, industrialization, and innovation.

In conclusion, SDG 9 plays a vital role in promoting inclusive and sustainable development for older people. Helpage International recognizes the barriers faced by older persons in accessing infrastructure, employment, and technological advancements. By advocating for age-friendly design principles, inclusive industrialization, and innovation, we work towards a future where older people can fully participate in and benefit from the advances of a rapidly changing world.
