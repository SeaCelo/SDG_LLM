Introduction:

The Islamic Development Bank (IDB) is pleased to present this detailed analytical report on SDG 9 â€“ Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure. As a committed partner to the United Nations Agenda for Sustainable Development, the IDB recognizes the critical importance of this goal in driving economic growth, fostering innovation, and enhancing infrastructure to support sustainable development in member countries.

Overview of SDG 9:

SDG 9 aims to build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation. It recognizes that infrastructure development and industrialization are crucial drivers of economic growth, job creation, and poverty reduction, particularly in developing countries. This goal also acknowledges the need for technological progress and innovation to address global challenges and ensure a sustainable future for all.

Challenges in Achieving SDG 9:

1. Infrastructure Gap: The development of quality and resilient infrastructure remains a challenge in many member countries. Limited access to electricity, inadequate transport systems, and insufficient information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure impede economic development and hinder investments.

2. Industrialization and Diversification: Building robust and sustainable industrial sectors requires policy support, capacity-building, and access to finance. Many member countries face barriers such as low technological capabilities, limited market access, and over-reliance on commodity exports, hampering their industrialization efforts.

3. Innovation and Research and Development (R&D): Enhancing technological capabilities, promoting innovation, and investment in R&D are critical for sustainable development. Many member countries lack the necessary resources and institutional frameworks to foster innovation and technological advancement, hindering their ability to participate in the global knowledge-based economy.

IDB Initiatives and Programs:

The IDB has embarked on numerous initiatives and programs to support member countries in attaining the targets set under SDG 9. These efforts include:

1. Infrastructure Financing: The IDB provides financing for infrastructure projects in member countries, primarily through public-private partnerships (PPPs) and mobilization of Islamic finance instruments such as sukuk. This supports the development of energy, transport, ICT, and water and sanitation infrastructure, helping bridge the infrastructure gap.

2. Industrial Capacity Building: The IDB facilitates capacity-building programs to support industrial diversification and strengthen value chains in member countries. This includes technical assistance, knowledge-sharing platforms, and financing mechanisms to promote investment in priority sectors and enhance industrial productivity.

3. Innovation Promotion: Recognizing the pivotal role of innovation in achieving sustainable development, the IDB supports innovation promotion initiatives through partnerships with international stakeholders, research institutions, and start-up ecosystems. This includes funding for incubators, innovation labs, and mentorship programs to foster entrepreneurship, technology transfer, and knowledge exchange.

Best Practices and Success Stories:

1. Morocco - Renewable Energy: The IDB has supported Morocco's ambitious renewable energy program, enabling the country to rapidly ramp up its renewable energy share. Through funding for solar and wind power projects, Morocco has become a regional leader in renewable energy generation, reducing its dependence on fossil fuels and mitigating climate change.

2. Turkey - Industrial Zones Development: The IDB has partnered with Turkey to establish industrial zones in underserved regions, facilitating inclusive industrial growth and job creation. These zones provide necessary infrastructure, attract investments, and nurture small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), supporting economic diversification and reducing regional disparities.

Conclusion:

SDG 9 necessitates concerted efforts to bridge the infrastructure gap, foster sustainable industrialization, and promote innovation. The IDB, in partnership with member countries and stakeholders, has been actively assisting in these areas to help achieve this goal. However, persistent challenges, such as limited resources and low technological capabilities, require continued commitment and strategic interventions to ensure sustainable and inclusive development for all member countries. By prioritizing investments in infrastructure, promoting industrialization, and fostering innovation, the IDB remains dedicated to supporting the attainment of SDG 9 and realizing the broader vision of sustainable development.
