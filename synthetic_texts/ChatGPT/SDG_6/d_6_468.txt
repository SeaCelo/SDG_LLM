The world is facing a pressing challenge - the issue of water scarcity and the need for clean and safe sanitation facilities. This challenge has prompted the United Nations to include access to clean water and sanitation as Sustainable Development Goal number 6 (SDG 6), as part of its ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In this article, we will delve into the importance of SDG 6, the progress made so far, and the road ahead.

Access to clean water and proper sanitation facilities is vital for human health, environmental sustainability, and economic development. Yet, unfortunately, millions of people around the world still lack these basic necessities. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), around one in three people globally do not have access to safe drinking water, and almost half the global population lack access to safely managed sanitation services. This alarming situation has grave consequences, as water-related diseases continue to plague many nations, particularly in the developing world.

Recognizing the urgency of the situation, the international community, through the United Nations, formulated SDG 6 to achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all, and access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all by 2030. This comprehensive goal includes not only the provision of services but also aims to improve water quality, increase water-use efficiency in all sectors, implement integrated water resources management, protect and restore water-related ecosystems, and support the participation of local communities in water and sanitation planning and management.

To monitor progress towards SDG 6, global efforts have been made to develop indicators and collect reliable data. WaterAid, a prominent international charity, has created an Water Sanitation Hygiene (WASH) Accountability e-Platform, which enables stakeholders to access and contribute to real-time data on water and sanitation services. Monitoring and evaluation frameworks have been put in place to track SDG 6 targets, such as monitoring water stress levels, assessing water quality, and measuring access to basic sanitation facilities.

While the challenges are immense, there have been encouraging signs of progress. As reported by the United Nations, since the formulation of SDG 6, billion people have gained access to improved drinking water services, and 1.8 billion people have gained access to basic sanitation facilities. Governments, international organizations, and civil society have been coming together to address this pivotal issue. Innovative solutions have emerged, such as mobile water treatment plants and decentralized sanitation systems, which have proved beneficial in remote and underserved areas.

Moreover, many countries have introduced policy reforms and institutional changes to prioritize water and sanitation. Governments are investing in infrastructure development, creating awareness campaigns, and promoting behavior change towards water conservation and hygiene practices. Multilateral organizations, including the World Bank and regional development banks, have also significantly increased their financing for water and sanitation projects.

However, the road to achieving SDG 6 remains arduous. Several challenges persist, including inadequate financing, poor governance structures, and lack of proper implementation capacity in many countries. Climate change exacerbates these difficulties, as changing weather patterns, extreme droughts, and flooding events impact water availability and quality. Additionally, lacking water and sanitation services disproportionately affect vulnerable and marginalized communities, exacerbating social inequalities.

To overcome these challenges, it is crucial for nations to prioritize water and sanitation in their national agendas and collaborate with the international community and stakeholders. Governments should focus not only on infrastructure development but also on capacity building, policy reforms, and the involvement of local communities. Implementing innovative solutions, such as nature-based solutions for water management and private sector engagement, can unlock new avenues for progress.

In conclusion, SDG 6 emphasizes the critical importance of ensuring access to clean water and proper sanitation for all. While progress has been made, significant efforts are still required to achieve this ambitious goal. The international community, governments, and civil society must continue to work together to mobilize resources, build capacity, and promote sustainable practices. The path to SDG 6 may be challenging, but the reward of a world where no person is left without safe drinking water and sanitation facilities is more than worth the effort.
