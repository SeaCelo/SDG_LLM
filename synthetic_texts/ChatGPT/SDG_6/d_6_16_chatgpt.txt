Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) aims to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. This detailed analytical report provides an in-depth examination of the current state of SDG 6 implementation in middle-income countries (MICs), with the intent to inform experts about the progress and challenges pertaining to this goal.

Middle-income countries, characterized by their growing economies, often face unique water and sanitation challenges due to the dynamic nature of their demographic and economic transitions. Therefore, understanding and addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive analysis that takes into account the varying contexts and specificities of these countries.

Achieving SDG 6 in MICs requires a multi-dimensional approach. This report explores four key dimensions to assess the progress and barriers: access to clean water and sanitation, water quality and ecosystem protection, integrated water resource management, and transboundary water cooperation.

Access to clean water and sanitation is the foundational aspect of SDG 6. While many MICs have made substantial progress in this area, there are still significant gaps to be addressed. This report examines the disparities in access within MICs, including rural-urban divides and income-related inequalities. By highlighting these disparities, policymakers can develop targeted interventions to reach the most marginalized populations and ensure equitable access.

Water quality and ecosystem protection is another crucial dimension of SDG 6. It involves safeguarding water bodies and ensuring sustainable use and management of water resources. MICs face various challenges such as pollution from industrial and agricultural activities, as well as inadequate wastewater treatment infrastructure. This report investigates the extent of water pollution and the adequacy of existing mechanisms for sustainable ecosystem management in MICs, identifying areas that require immediate attention.

Integrated water resource management (IWRM) is another critical aspect of SDG 6, particularly relevant to MICs facing water scarcity and competing demands. This report delves into the approaches taken by MICs for IWRM, evaluating their effectiveness in ensuring optimal utilization of water resources. It also highlights the importance of stakeholder engagement, community participation, and cross-sectoral coordination in achieving sustainable water management.

Transboundary water cooperation is especially pertinent to MICs sharing water resources with their neighboring countries. This report analyzes current practices and challenges in transboundary water governance, underscoring the need for effective cooperation mechanisms to enhance water security and prevent conflicts. It also examines the role of regional organizations and international frameworks in supporting cooperation efforts.

Apart from the four key dimensions, this report assesses the role of governance, data collection, and financing mechanisms in SDG 6 implementation in MICs. Good governance plays a vital role in formulating and implementing policies that prioritize water and sanitation, while robust data collection facilitates evidence-based decision-making. Furthermore, adequate financing is crucial, as many MICs require additional funding to bridge the investment gaps in water and sanitation infrastructure.

Overall, this report provides a comprehensive examination of the current state of SDG 6 implementation in middle-income countries. By focusing on access, water quality, integrated water resource management, transboundary cooperation, governance, data, and financing, it aims to inform experts about the progress and challenges faced by these countries. The findings and recommendations within this report can serve as a valuable resource for policymakers, development practitioners, and other stakeholders committed to advancing SDG 6 in middle-income countries and ensuring water and sanitation for all.
