The Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) lays forth a comprehensive vision and framework to ensure universal access to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services for all. As the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA), it is both my duty and privilege to present a detailed analytical report on the current state of SDG 6 with a particular focus on least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs). This report aims to shed light on the progress made, key challenges faced, and recommendations for realizing SDG 6 in these vulnerable contexts.

LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs face unique and compounding challenges in achieving SDG 6 targets due to several interlinked factors, such as limited resources, geographical constraints, climate change impacts, governance issues, and political instability. Water scarcity, poor sanitation infrastructure, and inadequate access to safe drinking water are pervasive across these regions, exacerbating health risks and hindering social and economic development.

Significant variations exist among LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs, considering their diverse contexts and circumstances. In many LDCs, basic WASH services remain a distant reality, with limited investments, inadequate institutions, and lack of robust policies. The absence of sustainable water management practices and weak sanitation infrastructure perpetuate waterborne diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, leading to increased child mortality rates and hampering educational opportunities. At the same time, these countries also face a critical need to improve water resource management, as they are vulnerable to climate change impacts such as severe droughts and floods.

SIDS face a unique set of challenges. Being located on small islands, they are highly exposed to the impacts of climate change, including rising sea levels and increasing salinity of freshwater sources, posing a threat to already scarce water resources. Additionally, economic constraints and limited human resource capacities hinder their ability to invest in resilient infrastructures and technologies. The pressing need for improved WASH services in SIDS is closely entwined with the achievement of other SDGs, such as climate action, poverty reduction, and sustainable cities and communities.

Similarly, LLDCs face multiple barriers in achieving SDG 6 targets. The absence of direct access to coastal waters, coupled with their state of being landlocked, increases dependence on neighboring countries for water resources and sanitation services. This dependence raises challenges relating to cost, reliability, and equity. Ensuring coordinated action among neighboring countries and addressing transboundary water management is critical to improving water security and promoting sustainable WASH services in LLDCs.

Despite these challenges, some positive developments have been witnessed in LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs. Political commitments and increased global awareness have made governments more accountable for WASH service delivery. Initiatives like decentralized and community-led approaches, capacity building programs, and South-South cooperation have shown promising results in enhancing accessibility and sustainability of WASH services in these regions. Additionally, intensified investments in technology innovation, infrastructure development, and rehabilitation of water resources can bolster the momentum necessary to driving progress.

To effectively address the remaining gaps, it is imperative for international stakeholders, governments, and civil society to collectively mobilize efforts. Strengthening investment in urban and rural infrastructures, introducing efficient water management techniques, leveraging renewable energy sources, and throwing necessary support behind local institutions are some of the recommended actions. Additionally, investing in innovations like digital technologies and smart systems can enhance monitoring, evaluation, and management of WASH services, leading to more evidence-based decision-making.

In conclusion, achieving SDG 6 in LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs requires tailored approaches that consider the contextual challenges faced by these regions. The ESCWA recognizes the urgent need for collaborative and targeted action to bridge the gaps. By prioritizing investments, fostering technological innovations, promoting capacity building, and strengthening governance structures, progress can be made towards ensuring access to clean water, adequate sanitation, and improved hygiene practices in these vulnerable nations. It is only through this collective and multidimensional effort that we can realize the vision of leaving no one behind in the journey towards a sustainable future.
