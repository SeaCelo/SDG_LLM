Introduction

This analytical report, prepared by International Medical Relief (IMR), aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of SDG 6: "Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all." By examining the progress, challenges, and prospects of SDG 6, this report seeks to inform expert audiences about the current status and implementation efforts concerning one of the crucial Sustainable Development Goals.

Progress on SDG 6

Global progress towards achieving SDG 6 has been significant but varied across regions. Access to basic drinking water sources has generally improved, with 91% of the global population having access to improved water sources in 2017, up from 76% in 1990. However, disparity still persists, with 785 million people lacking access to basic drinking water services.

Sanitation is a significant challenge globally, as 2.3 billion people lack safely managed sanitation facilities. Efforts to address this issue have gained momentum, but progress remains slow, especially in rural areas and low-income settings. Additionally, open defecation practices continue to prevail in some regions, leading to environmental pollution and health hazards.

Challenges and Constraints

Improving water and sanitation access faces several challenges and constraints:

1. Economic and Financial Constraints: Insufficient investment and limited financial resources constrain the implementation of necessary infrastructure projects. Developing countries, in particular, struggle to mobilize funds for water and sanitation infrastructure development and maintenance.

2. Climate Change: Increased water scarcity, droughts, and flooding due to climate change place additional strain on water resources and service provision. This calls for innovative strategies to manage water resources sustainably and adapt to the changing climate patterns.

3. Governance and Institutional Constraints: Weak governance, corruption, and lack of coordination among stakeholders hinder effective policy implementation in the water and sanitation sector. Effective governance frameworks and institutional mechanisms are necessary to ensure sustainable management and equitable access.

Innovative Approaches and Best Practices

To tackle the challenges and improve the outcomes of SDG 6, several innovative approaches have emerged, demonstrating promising results:

1. Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in Water and Sanitation: Collaborations between public and private entities have leveraged expertise, technology, and funding for infrastructure development, operations, and maintenance. Successful examples of PPPs include the Manila Water Concession in the Philippines and the ONE ASIA project in India.

2. Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM): This approach integrates social, economic, and environmental dimensions to ensure equitable and sustainable water resource management leading to long-term water availability for all. The Rwenzori region in Uganda and the Rhine River Basin in Europe exemplify effective implementation of IWRM.

3. Decentralization of governance: Effective decentralized approaches, such as community-based management and local involvement in decision-making, can enhance ownership, sustainability, and effectiveness of water and sanitation projects. The Bangladesh Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project (BRWSSP) and the Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) initiative in multiple countries demonstrate successful localization efforts.

Conclusion and Recommendations

While progress has been made, achieving SDG 6 by 2030 requires accelerated efforts and robust partnerships at all levels. IMR recommends the following strategies for enhanced implementation:

1. Increase investment: Governments and international development partners should prioritize investment in water and sanitation infrastructures, focusing on disadvantaged regions and vulnerable populations.

2. Strengthen institutions and governance: Robust governance frameworks, accountability mechanisms, and coordination among stakeholders are essential for effective policy implementation in water and sanitation.

3. Enhance collaboration: Governments, private sectors, civil society organizations, and other key stakeholders should collaborate and share knowledge and best practices to address the challenges of water and sanitation access effectively.

4. Foster innovation: Promote research and development to create innovative technological solutions for improved water management, wastewater treatment, and sanitation facilities. Encourage the incorporation of green technologies and digital innovations to enhance efficiency and sustainability.

By adopting these recommendations and embracing a holistic and inclusive approach, the international community can make significant strides towards fulfilling SDG 6, ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. International cooperation, political commitment, and collective actions are pivotal for achieving this vital development goal and shaping a better future for all.
