The need for sustainable water and sanitation practices is more important than ever, especially for women and girls who are disproportionately affected by the lack of access to clean water and adequate sanitation facilities. As an expert in the field of gender and development, the International Women's Development Agency (IWDA) has conducted an in-depth analysis of the progress made towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 6 - Clean Water and Sanitation. This report aims to provide a detailed overview of the current situation, highlighting the challenges faced in meeting the targets, and offering recommendations for policy and practice interventions.

The overarching goal of SDG 6 is to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all by 2030. While significant progress has been made since the advent of the Millennium Development Goals, much remains to be done to achieve universal access to clean water and sanitation. Furthermore, the gender dimension of water and sanitation emphasizes the inequality faced by women and girls in accessing these basic services. IWDA's analysis focuses on understanding the key challenges and advocating for gender-responsive interventions.

Accessible and clean water is a basic necessity, but millions of people, predominantly women and girls, still lack access to safe drinking water sources. Rural and marginalized communities are particularly affected, with limited access to clean water as a result of geographic remoteness, economic inequality, and gender-based discrimination. Women and girls often bear the burden of walking long distances to collect water, exposing them to risks of sexual violence and impeding their ability to attend school or engage in income-generating activities.

When it comes to sanitation, the lack of proper facilities puts women and girls at even greater risk. In many communities, women are forced to practice open defecation due to the absence of private toilets. This not only compromises their dignity and safety but also exposes them to health hazards and infections. Lack of sanitation is also a significant contributing factor to the prevalence of preventable diseases, affecting overall well-being and productivity.

The achievement of SDG 6 requires interdisciplinary action and the integration of gender-responsive policies and practices. Policies must consider the unique challenges faced by women and girls and ensure their active participation in decision-making processes related to water and sanitation. Government investment in infrastructure, improved governance systems, and community-led initiatives are pivotal in providing sustainable solutions. Addressing cultural norms and gender inequalities by empowering women and girls to become decision-makers, community leaders, and entrepreneurs is vital for inclusive and sustainable progress.

Furthermore, partnerships between government, civil society organizations, and the private sector are critical in enhancing the implementation of SDG 6. Collaborative efforts can drive innovation, embrace new technologies, and mobilize resources for sustainable water and sanitation solutions. Investing in robust monitoring and data collection mechanisms can provide accurate assessments of progress, enabling evidence-based decision-making and informed policy interventions.

Implemented interventions must go beyond provision and distribution of clean water and sanitation facilities, but also address hygiene practices and education. Understanding and addressing social and cultural factors that hinder behavior change and adoption of sustainable practices is crucial. Education and awareness campaigns targeting both women and men, with a specific emphasis on menstrual hygiene management, can challenge stigmatization and promote positive behavioral change.

To conclude, achieving SDG 6 requires comprehensive efforts to address the challenges faced by women and girls in accessing clean water and sanitation facilities. Recognizing and integrating their voices, needs, and rights is crucial for achieving inclusive and sustainable outcomes. Through evidence-based policy-making, collaboration, and gender-responsive interventions, we can move closer to realizing universal access to clean water and sanitation - a goal that is essential for human well-being, economic development, and gender equality.
