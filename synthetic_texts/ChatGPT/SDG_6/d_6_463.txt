Water is a universal necessity, crucial to sustaining life, and a key driver of economic development. It is a resource that knows no boundaries or preferences, and in today's world, access to clean water and adequate sanitation should be a basic human right. This is what the United Nations understood when they established Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) - ensuring access to water and sanitation for all by 2030.

SDG 6 is not just an aspirational goal; it is a commitment to address one of the most pressing global challenges. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), around 2.2 billion people lack access to clean and safe drinking water, and a staggering 4.2 billion people live without access to improved sanitation facilities.

The consequences of this are dire, particularly for marginalized communities of color. Systemic issues such as environmental racism and economic inequalities lead to insufficient access to clean water and sanitation for many African Americans and other minority groups nationwide. This disproportionately affects their overall well-being and economic opportunities.

Recognizing the urgency and importance of addressing these inequalities, SDG 6 aims to ensure universal access to clean water and sanitation, improve water quality, and promote efficient water usage. It also focuses on protecting and restoring water ecosystems and ensuring sustainable management of water resources. By achieving these targets, SDG 6 aims to leave no one behind.

To achieve these goals, collaboration between governments, corporations, and communities is essential. Private sector engagement can play a significant role in promoting water sustainability and advancing the SDG agenda. Water-intensive industries such as agriculture, manufacturing, and energy can adopt sustainable practices, invest in innovative technologies, and reduce their water footprint.

One example of a corporation championing SDG 6 is Ecolab, a global leader in water technologies and services. Through their Water Stewardship program, Ecolab is actively improving water efficiency in industries, helping customers reduce water usage, and partnering with communities to develop sustainable water management solutions. This not only aligns with SDG 6 but also represents a business opportunity as water scarcity becomes an increasing concern globally.

Another crucial aspect of SDG 6 is investing in infrastructure and improving water management systems. This is critical, especially in marginalized communities lacking access to centralized water supply and sanitation facilities. The historic federal underinvestment in infrastructure, coupled with discriminatory zoning policies, has perpetuated the disparities in water access among communities of color.

Federal, state, and local governments must prioritize funding for water and sanitation infrastructure projects in marginalized communities. This includes improved distribution networks, wastewater treatment facilities, and sustainable infrastructure designs to ensure equitable access to safe drinking water.

Education and awareness about water conservation and hygiene practices are equally important. In many communities, lack of knowledge about sanitation and hygiene leads to ill health and disease. Public information campaigns, school curriculum integration, and community engagement are vital in empowering individuals with information to make better choices and ensure sustainable water practices.

SDG 6 represents more than just a goal; it is a commitment to making clean water and sanitation a reality for everyone, despite their socioeconomic background or race. It provides an opportunity for governments, corporations, and communities to come together and address the systemic inequalities that often perpetuate water access disparities.

By investing in sustainable water practices, promoting environmental justice, and prioritizing infrastructure development, we can not only achieve SDG 6 but also create a more equitable and resilient society. The time to act is now, and together, we can turn the tide on water inequality and ensure a bright and sustainable future for all.
