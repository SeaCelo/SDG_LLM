Introduction 

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the current state of Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6), focusing on access to clean water and sanitation. It aims to provide expert insight into the progress, challenges, and potential impact of SDG 6, from the perspective of Women in Europe for a Common Future (WECF). 

Background
SDG 6, one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations, focuses on ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. Water and sanitation are essential for human health, well-being, and socio-economic development. 

Progress and Achievements
Since the adoption of SDG 6 in 2015, progress has been made in improving global water and sanitation accessibility. Millions of people have gained access to reliable and clean drinking water sources, reducing water-borne diseases and child mortality rates. Sanitation initiatives have also increased, promoting basic hygiene practices and reducing open defecation.

Europe has been at the forefront of efforts to achieve SDG 6, with many countries already having well-established water and sanitation infrastructure. This has significantly contributed to exceeding the global targets. Nonetheless, challenges persist, particularly in certain regions and vulnerable communities.

Challenges and Gaps
Despite progress, significant challenges remain in achieving SDG 6. Firstly, there are geographic disparities, with rural and marginalized communities facing greater difficulties in accessing clean water and sanitation services. As Women in Europe for a Common Future, we have observed that women and girls, in particular, are disproportionately affected by such inequalities.

Secondly, climate change exacerbates water scarcity, leading to increased competition for resources. This poses further challenges to achieving SDG 6 targets, as water sources become more limited and sanitation infrastructure is threatened by extreme weather events.

Additionally, the lack of financial resources and inadequate governance structures hinder progress in implementing effective water and sanitation policies. Weak institutional capacity and fragmented coordination frameworks contribute to the persistence of service gaps. Strengthening these aspects is vital to accelerate progress toward achieving SDG 6.

Innovation and Good Practices
Recognizing the importance of innovation and good practices, various countries in Europe have implemented notable initiatives to address the challenges faced in achieving SDG 6.

One such example is Germany's "Blue Sponsoring" program, which engages local businesses in sustainable water management projects. By supporting and investing in water conservation measures, companies contribute to achieving SDG 6 while enhancing their corporate social responsibility.

The Netherlands has established itself as a leader in water management, employing innovative approaches to ensure water security and sanitation. They have implemented comprehensive water governance strategies, investing in water treatment technologies, and promoting robust public-private partnerships.

Best practices can also be found at the community level, such as the establishment of decentralized wastewater treatment systems in rural areas, ensuring access to proper sanitation.

Conclusion and Recommendations
SDG 6 plays a crucial role in ensuring universal access to clean water and sanitation. While progress has been made, challenges related to inequalities, climate change, and governance need to be addressed.

To accelerate progress, Women in Europe for a Common Future recommends the following:

1. Increase investments in water and sanitation projects, with a particular focus on marginalized communities and vulnerable groups.
2. Strengthen governance structures and coordinate mechanisms to ensure effective implementation and monitoring of water and sanitation policies and initiatives.
3. Promote innovation and good practices in water management, encouraging public-private partnerships and community-led initiatives.
4. Enhance climate resilience by incorporating adaptive measures into water and sanitation infrastructure planning.
5. Improve data collection, monitoring, and evaluation frameworks to accurately assess progress and identify areas that require targeted interventions.

By addressing these recommendations, we can move closer to achieving SDG 6, thereby safeguarding health, dignity, and well-being for all, leaving no one behind.
