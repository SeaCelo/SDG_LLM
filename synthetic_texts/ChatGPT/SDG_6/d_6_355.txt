Introduction

The African Development Bank (AfDB) is pleased to present this detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) – Clean Water and Sanitation. This report aims to provide an expert audience with a comprehensive understanding of the current state of SDG 6 in Africa, while identifying notable achievements, existing challenges, and necessary actions to accelerate progress towards the goal.

Overview of SDG 6

SDG 6 seeks to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. This ambitious goal encompasses various targets, including universal access to safe and affordable drinking water, providing adequate sanitation facilities, improving water quality, increasing water-use efficiency, and supporting integrated water resources management.

Current State of SDG 6 in Africa

Access to clean water and basic sanitation remains a significant challenge in many parts of Africa. While progress has been made, an estimated 418 million Africans still lack access to basic drinking water sources, and 717 million do not have access to improved sanitation facilities. Disparities exist between rural and urban areas, as well as among different regions within the continent.

Achievements in SDG 6 Implementation

Despite the challenges, Africa has made several notable achievements in pursuit of SDG 6. For instance, the percentage of people with access to basic drinking water sources has increased from 60% in 2000 to 69% in 2017. Similarly, the proportion of population with access to improved sanitation facilities has risen from 28% to 48% during the same period.

The AfDB’s Contribution

The African Development Bank has played a vital role in advancing SDG 6 across the continent. As a leading regional development finance institution, the AfDB has provided crucial financial support to member countries for water and sanitation projects. Through its various initiatives and partnerships, the Bank has helped improve access to clean water and sanitation services for millions of Africans.

Key Challenges and Barriers

Several challenges hinder the progress of SDG 6 in Africa. First, inadequate infrastructure investments and operational capacities remain barriers to expanding access to water and sanitation services. Limited financial resources, coupled with weak governance structures, often undermine sustainable development efforts.

Additionally, climate change poses a significant threat to water resources in Africa. Increased frequency and intensity of floods, droughts, and other extreme weather events put additional stress on water availability and quality. This necessitates the integration of climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies into water management plans.

Furthermore, issues of gender inequality, social exclusion, and insufficient participation of marginalized communities in decision-making processes impact access to water and sanitation services. A more inclusive and gender-responsive approach is crucial for the achievement of SDG 6 in Africa.

Recommended Actions

To accelerate progress towards SDG 6, the following key actions are highly recommended:

1. Strengthening institutional and governance capacities: Building strong institutions and improving governance structures are essential for sustained progress in the water and sanitation sector. Governments should prioritize investment in capacity development and promotion of sound policies, regulations, and monitoring mechanisms.

2. Enhancing water resources management: Integrated management of water resources is critical to address the increasing water scarcity and ensure equitable access. Countries should focus on effective demand management, groundwater protection, and enhancing the efficiency of water-use practices through technological innovations.

3. Mobilizing financial resources: Given the magnitude of investments required, mobilizing both domestic and international financing for water and sanitation projects is crucial. African governments should explore innovative financing mechanisms, such as public-private partnerships, blended finance, and impact investments, to attract more capital to the sector.

4. Promoting partnerships and knowledge sharing: Collaboration between governments, development partners, civil society organizations, and the private sector is essential. Partnerships should be fostered to leverage expertise, resources, and technical know-how. Knowledge sharing platforms and networks should be strengthened to facilitate learning and exchange of best practices.

Conclusion

While challenges persist, Africa's commitment and progress towards SDG 6 cannot be overlooked. With a concerted effort from governments, development partners, and all stakeholders, Africa can achieve universal access to clean water and sanitation, ensuring a sustainable and inclusive future for its people. The African Development Bank stands ready to continue supporting member countries in their efforts to attain SDG 6, contributing to the broader Agenda 2030 and the sustainable development of the continent.
