Title: Water and Sanitation for All: Assessing Progress and Challenges under SDG 6

Abstract:
This article critically examines the progress, challenges, and implications of Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) - "Clean Water and Sanitation" - which aims to ensure universal access to clean water and adequate sanitation by 2030. Drawing upon empirical evidence, statistical analysis, and policy insights, we assess the effectiveness of various interventions aimed at achieving SDG 6 targets. We highlight the importance of data, intersectoral collaborations, and innovative approaches to overcome key constraints and accelerate progress towards the goal. Finally, we outline potential avenues for future research and policy agenda to ensure sustainable water and sanitation practices globally.
