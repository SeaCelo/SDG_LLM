Ocean preservation and conservation have emerged as significant environmental issues in recent years. To address these concerns, the United Nations has established the Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG 14), focused on ensuring the sustainable use and preservation of the world's oceans, seas, and marine resources. As experts in gender equality and women's empowerment, the International Women's Development Agency (IWDA) presents this report to provide an in-depth analytical assessment of the current status of SDG 14 and its implications from a gender perspective.

Ocean health and biodiversity are critical to ensuring sustainable socio-economic development and the livelihoods of millions of people around the globe. However, women, who are often disproportionately impacted by environmental degradation, are vital contributors to sustainable ocean management and the achievement of SDG 14. It is imperative to recognize and address the unique challenges faced by women in coastal communities and leverage their knowledge, skills, and potential as agents of positive change.

Gender-based inequalities, including restricted access to resources, decision-making power, and education, hinder women's full participation in ocean governance and protection initiatives. Consequently, their contributions remain undervalued and underused. This gender disparity intensifies vulnerabilities and perpetuates a cycle of marginalization, leading to the exacerbation of poverty, food insecurity, and gender-based violence within coastal areas.

To address this gender-specific gap, IWDA urges policymakers, organizations, and actors to adopt an intersectional and gender-transformative approach when implementing SDG 14. This approach must recognize and address the varied needs and concerns of women, considering their unique experiences based on factors such as age, class, ethnicity, and disability.

Recognizing that gender equality is a precondition for sustainable development, IWDA recommends several strategies to integrate a gender perspective into SDG 14 implementation. Firstly, women's participation and representation at all levels of decision-making processes must be ensured. This includes involving women in local coastal governance structures, policy-making bodies, and national and international ocean management forums. Women's perspectives and voices must be actively sought and taken into account in the development, implementation, and monitoring of relevant policies, programs, and initiatives.

Secondly, IWDA emphasizes the importance of providing women with equal access to resources and opportunities. This entails removing gender-specific barriers in accessing credit, technology, sustainable fishing practices, and ownership and control of coastal resources. Special attention should be given to building women's capacities in sustainable resource management, promoting entrepreneurship, and enhancing their numeracy and technical skills.

Furthermore, IWDA recognizes the urgent need to address the gendered impacts of climate change on coastal communities and their associated ecosystems. Climate change disproportionately affects women due to their social roles, responsibilities, and limited adaptive capacities. Therefore, climate resilience efforts must be gender-responsive and inclusive, ensuring that resources, information, and technology are accessible to all.

Moreover, the IWDA emphasizes the importance of collecting sex-disaggregated data and conducting gender analysis to inform evidence-based policymaking and program implementation. This would facilitate the identification of gaps, assess progress, and develop targeted interventions for addressing gender inequalities in the context of SDG14.

The IWDA recommends strengthening strategic partnerships between governments, civil society organizations, and the private sector to collectively address the intersecting challenges faced by women in coastal communities. These partnerships must foster collaboration, knowledge-sharing, and capacity-building opportunities, while also allocating adequate funding to support gender-transformative initiatives.

In conclusion, the realization of SDG 14 is contingent upon incorporating a gender perspective that recognizes the invaluable contributions of women in coastal communities. By dismantling structural barriers, empowering women, and promoting inclusivity, SDG 14 can effectively address the multifaceted challenges threatening ocean ecosystems and resources. It is crucial that gender equality remains not only a stand-alone goal but also an integral part of sustainable ocean management practices and policies. Only then can we ensure the wellbeing of current and future generations, as well as the long-term sustainability of our oceans.
