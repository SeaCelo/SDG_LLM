FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS REPORT

Prepared by: Economic Commission for Africa

1. Introduction

This analytical report aims to evaluate the progress made towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14 - "Life Below Water." It specifically examines the challenges faced and the progress being made by the least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) in achieving this goal.

2. Background

SDG 14 calls for the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development. It addresses various concerns such as pollution, overfishing, and the decline of marine ecosystems, highlighting the need for immediate action to ensure healthy and productive oceans.

2.1 Least Developed Countries (LDCs)

LDCs represent a group of countries that face significant challenges in achieving sustainable development. Although these countries are rich in coastal resources, they confront immense difficulties such as limited technical and financial capacity, inadequate infrastructure, and high vulnerability to climate change impacts.

2.2 Small Island Developing States (SIDS)

SIDS are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including rising sea levels, ocean acidification, and extreme weather events. These island nations heavily depend on marine resources for livelihoods, tourism, and fisheries, making SDG 14 even more critical for their survival and development.

2.3 Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs)

LLDCs, by their geographical nature, lack direct access to the sea, significantly hampering their participation in maritime economic activities. This situation affects trade and the integration of LLDCs into global markets, which in turn negatively impacts sustainable development efforts.

3. Challenges Faced by LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs in Achieving SDG 14

3.1 Environmental Challenges

LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs face various environmental challenges in achieving SDG 14. For example, rapid coastal development, overfishing, unsustainable tourism practices, and pollution threaten the health and diversity of marine ecosystems. This issue is further exacerbated by climate change impacts, ocean acidification, and the increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events.

3.2 Institutional and Financial Challenges

These group of countries encounter significant institutional and financial challenges that hinder their progress towards SDG 14. Weak governmental institutions, limited capacities for marine resource management, and insufficient financial resources hamper their ability to implement sustainable practices and conservation measures. Accessing technology and technical expertise is also a challenge for many LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs.

4. Progress and Case Studies

4.1 Progress in LDCs:

Despite these challenges, several LDCs have made commendable progress towards SDG 14. For instance, Cambodia has implemented policies to protect its coastal zones and fisheries, promoting sustainable aquaculture practices and raising awareness among fishing communities on the importance of conservation. Mozambique has established marine protected areas to tackle overfishing and unsustainable practices.

4.2 Progress in SIDS:

SIDS have also achieved significant milestones in their efforts toward SDG 14. The Seychelles has created a strong governance framework for marine resources protection and monitoring, effectively tackling illegal fishing activities. Palau implemented a flagship initiative called the Palau National Marine Sanctuary, establishing a large-scale marine protected area to safeguard its valuable biodiversity and sustainably manage its fish stocks.

4.3 Progress in LLDCs:

Although it may seem unconventional to address SDG 14 for LLDCs due to their lack of direct access to the sea, they have a crucial role to play in preserving freshwater ecosystems. For example, Zambia has introduced innovative policies to safeguard the ecological integrity of Lake Tanganyika, focusing on raising awareness about its importance and implementing sustainable fishing practices.

5. Conclusion

In conclusion, SDG 14 presents a complex and multifaceted challenge for LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs. While they face various environmental, institutional, and financial obstacles, numerous success stories demonstrate their commitment to conserving and sustainably using marine resources. However, concerted efforts are needed from all stakeholders, including international organizations, governments, and civil society, to provide adequate support, transfer of technology, build capacities, and enhance financing opportunities for LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs. Only through such collaborative efforts can we ensure the achievement of SDG 14 targets and create thriving ecosystems and healthy oceans for future generations.
