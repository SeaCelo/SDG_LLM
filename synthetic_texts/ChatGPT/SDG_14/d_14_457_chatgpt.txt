Introduction:

World Vision International

World Vision International (WVI) is a global humanitarian organization dedicated to working with children, families, and communities to create lasting change. With a focus on child well-being, WVI implements various programs and projects around the world, addressing issues related to education, health, child protection, and socio-economic development.

In alignment with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), WVI has embraced the mission of achieving a sustainable and inclusive future for all. In this report, we will delve into SDG 14 - Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development.

Understanding SDG 14:

SDG 14 recognizes the critical role that oceans play in supporting life on earth. It encompasses a wide range of aspects related to the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans, seas, and marine resources. This goal aims to not only secure the health and productivity of marine ecosystems but also promote sustainable practices that benefit communities reliant on marine resources.

The Importance of SDG 14:

Oceans cover more than 70% of the Earth's surface and are home to millions of species, providing vital ecological services such as carbon sequestration, climate regulation, and oxygen production. Furthermore, oceans are a source of food, livelihoods, and economic opportunities for billions of people worldwide.

Despite their relevance, oceans face numerous threats, including pollution, industrial overfishing, habitat destruction, and climate change. SDG 14 highlights the urgency to address these issues and ensures the sustainable management of oceans for future generations.

Targets and Indicators:

SDG 14 encompasses ten targets, which closely align with WVI's priorities in marine conservation. These targets focus on issues such as reducing marine pollution, protecting marine and coastal ecosystems, ending illegal fishing practices, and supporting small-scale fishers.

Examples of specific targets include:

1. By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution from all sources, including land-based activities, fishers, and maritime transport.
2. By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal fishing, and destructive fishing practices.
3. By 2020, conserve at least 10% of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information.
4. By 2030, increase the economic benefits to small island developing states (SIDS) and least developed countries from the sustainable use of marine resources.

The achievement of these targets is measured through 16 indicators, which help track progress and identify areas where sustainability efforts need additional support. Some indicators include the proportion of fish stocks within sustainable levels, the extent of coral reefs, and the proportion of marine protected areas established.

WVI's Role in Supporting SDG 14:

World Vision International recognizes the significance of SDG 14 in ensuring a sustainable future for vulnerable communities, particularly those dependent on marine resources. Our interventions aim to build resilient coastal communities that can thrive amidst environmental changes while conserving the oceans and marine life.

We implement projects focused on marine conservation, education, and advocacy, collaborating with local communities, governments, and other stakeholders. Our approach includes:

1. Promoting Sustainable Fishing Practices: WVI supports small-scale fishers by introducing sustainable fishing techniques, enabling communities to meet their immediate needs without jeopardizing the future of marine resources.

2. Community-based Marine Protection Areas: We assist communities in establishing marine protected areas where they can safeguard critical habitats, reduce overfishing, and promote ecosystem resilience.

3. Environmental Education and Awareness: WVI invests in comprehensive marine conservation education programs that involve both children and adults, emphasizing the importance of sustainable practices and ecosystem stewardship.

4. Policy Advocacy and Stakeholder Engagement: Collaboration with government bodies, fishing associations, and other stakeholders allows WVI to advocate for policies and regulations that protect marine resources and secure the rights of communities reliant on them.

Achievements and Impact:

Through our targeted interventions, World Vision International has made a significant impact on various communities worldwide. For instance, in coastal communities of the Philippines, we have successfully implemented sustainable fishing practices, resulting in increased productivity and the restoration of fish stocks.

Moreover, our conservation efforts in Mozambique have led to the expansion of marine protected areas, protecting vulnerable ecosystems and enhancing resilience against climate change impacts.

Collaborative Efforts:

World Vision International acknowledges the complexity and interconnectedness of the challenges pertaining to SDG 14 and recognizes that achieving sustainable marine ecosystems requires collaborative efforts. Therefore, we actively engage with stakeholders, including governments, intergovernmental bodies, and NGOs, to collectively address the threats faced by our oceans and seas.

Conclusion:

World Vision International considers SDG 14 as an essential blueprint for conserving and sustainably using our oceans, seas, and marine resources. By focusing on targeted interventions and local capacity-building, we work towards securing a resilient and prosperous future for coastal communities while safeguarding the integrity of the marine ecosystem.

Through cross-sectoral collaboration and active engagement with stakeholders, including governments and civil society, we are confident in our ability to make substantial progress towards achieving the targets and indicators outlined in SDG 14. Together, we can ensure the long-term sustainability of our oceans for generations to come.
