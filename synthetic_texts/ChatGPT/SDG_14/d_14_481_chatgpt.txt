DATELINE: Los Angeles, June 15, 2023

Our beautiful city of Los Angeles has always been deeply connected to the oceans that surround us. From our iconic beaches to the scenic coastal cliffs, the Pacific Ocean has played a central role in shaping our identity. Yet, beneath the serene surface lies a crisis that goes far beyond our city's limits. Today, we turn our attention towards Sustainable Development Goal 14, a global commitment to conserve and sustainably use our oceans, seas, and marine resources.

SDG 14, titled "Life Below Water," recognizes the critical importance of protecting our oceans, which cover more than 70% of our planet's surface. This ambitious goal embodies the urgent need to address the countless threats our oceans face: pollution, overfishing, habitat destruction, rising sea levels, and ocean acidification, just to name a few.

First on the agenda is addressing plastic pollution, a mounting crisis threatening marine ecosystems worldwide. Every year, millions of tons of plastic waste enter our oceans, contaminating habitats and endangering thousands of marine species. In Los Angeles, we can take pride in our efforts to combat this issue, exemplified by the recent ban on single-use plastics in the city. However, much more work needs to be done, through government regulation, increased public awareness, and innovative recycling technologies.

Overfishing is another pressing concern worthy of our attention. The depletion of fish stocks not only poses an environmental threat but also impacts the livelihood of millions who depend on the ocean for sustenance and income. Innovative solutions such as fishing quotas, designated marine protected areas, and sustainable aquaculture practices can help ensure the long-term viability of marine resources while providing economic benefits to coastal communities.

But it doesn't stop there. Climate change remains one of the greatest challenges facing our oceans. Warming temperatures have already caused widespread bleaching of coral reefs, causing irreparable damage to these fragile ecosystems. We must embrace renewable energy sources, reduce our carbon emissions, and strengthen coastal infrastructure to withstand the rising sea levels and increased storm activity that climate change brings.

Meanwhile, local action must go hand in hand with global cooperation. As part of the United Nations' SDGs, SDG 14 underscores the importance of collaboration at the international level. Protecting global ocean health requires a collective commitment to sustainable fisheries management, reducing marine pollution, and preserving marine biodiversity. By partnering with other coastal cities, sharing best practices and expertise, Los Angeles can become a true leader in the worldwide effort to safeguard our oceans.

Fortunately, remarkable progress has already been witnessed in various parts of the globe. Worth noting is the establishment of marine protected areas covering almost 8% of global marine areas, and the decline in illegal fishing thanks to improved satellite technologies and increased surveillance. In these successes, we find glimpses of hope and inspiration.

As our city thrives and grows, it is our responsibility to ensure that every action we take supports SDG 14. This means considering the environmental impact of our daily choices, promoting sustainable business practices, and supporting local and international policy changes.

The plight of our oceans is too urgent to ignore, and together, we can make a difference. So let us embrace SDG 14 as a call to action, a guidepost towards a healthier and more sustainable future for ourselves and the generations to come.
