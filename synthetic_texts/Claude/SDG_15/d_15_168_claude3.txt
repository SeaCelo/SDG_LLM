Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 15 (Life on Land) written from the perspective of Michael Kinsley:

The Unsustainable Slog: Combating Terrestrial Ecosystem Loss and Biodiversity Collapse

By Michael Kinsley

Perhaps no Sustainable Development Goal exposes the utter myopia and self-defeating inertia of our species quite like SDG 15 - the quixotic quest to "protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems." With each passing year, the grim reality of desertification, deforestation, and mass biodiversity loss becomes more undeniable and the prospects for actually achieving this goal grow dimmer. Yet we continue tinkering at the margins, enacting feckless policies and hollow volunteerism rather than fundamentally reassessing our doministic relationship with the natural world. 

At the core of SDG 15 lies the cognitive dissonance of the entire sustainable development framework. We posit noble objectives like halting habitat degradation and ending wildlife trafficking, all while perpetuating the extractive, growth-obsessed economic model devouring what's left of our terrestrial environments. It's akin to installing a sprinkling system in a house engulfed in flames. Incremental measures to establish more protected areas or crack down on poaching amount to nothing more than rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic of ecological collapse.

The statistics are as staggering as they are depressing. Approximately 12 million hectares of forest are destroyed annually, driven by insatiable demands for agricultural land, mining, and urban development. A relentless conversion of wildlands to human utility has already annihilated 83% of all mammals by mass. Up to 1 million species now teeter on the brink of extinction, the sixth mass extermination event in our planet's history - only this time caused by a single bipedal vector of ecological devastation. 

And for what? So we can infinitely expand croplands poisoned by petrochemicals? Replace ancient sylvan majesty with soulless stucco housing developments and squalid cattle operations? This sociopathic crusade against nature is neither rational nor sustainable. It is the theological dogma of a fleetingly dominant species operating under the delusional premise of inexhaustible planetary abundance.

Yet rather than reckoning with our ecocidal status quo, we succumb to the pernicious myth of "sustainable use" - a rhetorical placebo that has enabled the virally metastatic growth of human activities across nearly 40% of Earth's landmass. So long as we designate arbitrary conservation areas and enact tokenistic policies, the logic goes, we can continue our relentless soil depletion, habitat fragmentation, and biosphere asphyxiation unabated - a deranged simulacrum of environmental stewardship.

In truth, the only viable path to realizing SDG 15 is dismantling the very economic and cultural paradigms that have rendered the goal nearly unachievable. This would entail nothing less than a civilizational reboot: abandoning unchecked consumerism, imposing strict population controls, establishing genuine biodiversity preserves on a planetary scale, and empowering indigenous communities to serve as eco-guardians of what wildlands remain.  

Of course, such a wholesale repudiation of anthropocentric supremacy requires precisely the humility, foresight and restraint our species has yet to demonstrate. So the unsustainable slog continues - hectare by hectare, species by species - propelled by an insatiable id that has become both the driver of human "progress" and the catalyst of our potentially terminal unraveling from the natural systems that sustain us. And all the earnestly vacant development goals in the world cannot forestall the eventual uninhabitability we've sown.
