The International Organization for Migration (IOM) is deeply committed to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 15, which aims to "protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss." Our organization recognizes the inextricable link between environmental sustainability, migration, and human mobility.

Degradation of terrestrial ecosystems, including deforestation, desertification, and loss of biodiversity, has far-reaching consequences for human populations, often leading to displacement and migration. Climate change, exacerbated by environmental degradation, is a significant driver of migration, with millions of people being forced to leave their homes due to droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events. Additionally, loss of arable land and natural resources can lead to conflicts over scarce resources, further fueling displacement and migration.

IOM's approach to SDG 15 is multi-faceted, addressing both the root causes of environmental degradation and the consequences for human mobility. We work closely with governments, civil society organizations, and local communities to promote sustainable land management practices, reforestation efforts, and biodiversity conservation. Our programs aim to build resilience in communities vulnerable to environmental degradation, empowering them to adapt to the impacts of climate change and reduce their dependency on unsustainable practices.

One of our flagship initiatives is the Environmental Sustainability and Climate Change Program, which focuses on integrating environmental considerations into IOM's operations and policies. Through this program, we support countries in developing comprehensive migration management strategies that incorporate climate change adaptation and mitigation measures. We also provide technical assistance and capacity-building to governments and stakeholders on issues such as disaster risk reduction, environmental migration, and sustainable urban planning.

In regions affected by desertification, IOM has implemented innovative programs to combat land degradation and promote sustainable land management practices. For instance, in the Sahel region of Africa, we have worked with local communities to restore degraded lands through techniques such as farmer-managed natural regeneration, agroforestry, and water harvesting. These initiatives not only help to combat desertification but also provide alternative livelihoods for communities, reducing the need for environmentally damaging practices and potentially mitigating migration pressures.

IOM recognizes that the loss of biodiversity is a major threat to human well-being and ecosystem services, which can exacerbate migration pressures. To address this challenge, we have partnered with conservation organizations and indigenous communities to protect and restore critical habitats and ecosystems. For example, in Central America, we have supported efforts to conserve the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor, a vital biodiversity hotspot that spans multiple countries. By promoting sustainable livelihoods and community-based conservation initiatives, we aim to reduce pressures on these fragile ecosystems and preserve the natural resources upon which many communities depend.

Furthermore, IOM is at the forefront of efforts to address the complex issue of environmental migration. We have developed tools and guidelines for policymakers and practitioners to better understand and respond to the challenges posed by environmentally induced migration. Our research and advocacy efforts aim to raise awareness about the rights and needs of environmental migrants, and to promote policies and frameworks that protect and support those displaced by environmental factors.

In conclusion, IOM's approach to SDG 15 is multidimensional, recognizing the intricate connections between environmental sustainability, human mobility, and sustainable development. Through our programs and initiatives, we strive to promote sustainable land management practices, combat desertification, and protect biodiversity, while simultaneously addressing the migration challenges associated with environmental degradation. By working closely with governments, local communities, and other stakeholders, we aim to build resilience, reduce vulnerabilities, and ensure that no one is left behind in the pursuit of a sustainable and equitable future.
