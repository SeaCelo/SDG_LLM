Safeguarding life on land, as outlined in Sustainable Development Goal 15, is a critical imperative that demands immediate and concerted action from all stakeholders, including governments, civil society, and the private sector. As the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), we recognize the inextricable link between a healthy environment and the well-being of children, who are among the most vulnerable to the impacts of ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss.

Our analysis reveals a deeply concerning trend of accelerating deforestation, habitat destruction, and the overexploitation of natural resources, driven by unsustainable agricultural practices, illegal logging, mining, and urbanization. These activities not only threaten biodiversity but also undermine the essential ecosystem services upon which millions of children and families rely for their subsistence, nutrition, and livelihoods.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, where a significant portion of the population depends on small-scale agriculture and natural resources for their livelihoods, the rapid loss of arable land due to desertification and soil degradation poses a severe threat to food security and nutrition. This, in turn, exacerbates existing vulnerabilities, including stunting, wasting, and other forms of malnutrition, which can have long-lasting impacts on a child's physical and cognitive development.

Furthermore, the degradation of forests and wetlands, which serve as critical natural buffers against extreme weather events, increases the risk of floods, droughts, and other climate-related disasters, disproportionately affecting children in low-income and marginalized communities. These events not only disrupt access to essential services like water, sanitation, and healthcare but also displace families, disrupt education, and exacerbate existing socioeconomic inequalities.

Recognizing the intrinsic value of biodiversity and the interconnectedness of human well-being and the health of ecosystems, UNICEF has adopted a multifaceted approach to addressing the challenges posed by SDG 15. This includes supporting community-based conservation efforts, promoting sustainable land management practices, and advocating for the inclusion of children's rights and environmental considerations in national and international policies.

For instance, in partnership with local communities and organizations, UNICEF has implemented initiatives to restore degraded landscapes through reforestation and sustainable agroforestry practices. These efforts not only help to mitigate the impacts of climate change and preserve biodiversity but also provide economic opportunities for families through the production of sustainable timber and non-timber forest products.

Additionally, we have worked to empower indigenous and local communities, who often possess invaluable traditional knowledge and practices for sustainable resource management. By recognizing and supporting their rights to land and natural resources, we can foster a more equitable and inclusive approach to conservation, while also promoting the preservation of cultural heritage and traditional ways of life.

Furthermore, UNICEF has actively engaged in advocacy efforts to mainstream children's rights and environmental considerations into national and international policies and frameworks. This includes supporting the integration of child-sensitive indicators and targets in national biodiversity strategies and action plans, as well as promoting the inclusion of children's perspectives and voices in decision-making processes related to land use and resource management.

However, despite these efforts, significant challenges remain. Addressing the root causes of ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss requires a comprehensive and coordinated approach that addresses underlying socioeconomic and political factors, such as poverty, inequality, weak governance, and unsustainable consumption and production patterns.

Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing vulnerabilities and highlighted the critical need for resilient and sustainable systems that can withstand future shocks and crises. As we work towards a green and inclusive recovery, it is essential that we prioritize investments in nature-based solutions, sustainable land management, and the empowerment of local communities, while also addressing the underlying drivers of environmental degradation.

In conclusion, achieving SDG 15 is not only critical for preserving biodiversity and protecting the planet, but it is also a fundamental prerequisite for ensuring the well-being and rights of children, who are among the most vulnerable to the impacts of ecosystem degradation. By adopting a comprehensive and inclusive approach that recognizes the interconnectedness of human and environmental health, we can create a more sustainable and equitable future for all.
