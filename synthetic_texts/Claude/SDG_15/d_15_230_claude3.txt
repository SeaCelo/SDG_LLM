Here is a draft academic article on SDG 15 (Life on Land), as if written by the late economist Alan B. Krueger:

Preserving Life on Land: An Economic Perspective on SDG 15
By Alan B. Krueger

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development represents an ambitious global effort to promote economic prosperity while protecting the planet's resources and biodiversity. Among the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Goal 15 - Life on Land - aims to "protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and biodiversity loss." As an economist, I believe achieving this goal is not only an environmental imperative but an economic necessity with profound implications for human welfare.

The notion that environmental conservation and economic growth are inherently at odds is deeply flawed. Terrestrial ecosystems provide a vast array of goods and services that underpin our economies and sustain human life. The estimated value of ecosystem services provided by land-based biomes like forests, grasslands, and wetlands exceeds $125 trillion per year globally. These services include carbon sequestration, water filtration, soil fertility, pollination, flood mitigation, and more. Depleting these natural assets through unsustainable practices is tantamount to drawing down the principal rather than just living off the interest.

Land degradation already directly impacts the livelihoods of over 1 billion people globally, exacerbating poverty, food insecurity, and economic precarity. The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification estimates that the annual income foregone from land degradation ranges from 3% to 8% of a country's GDP. Desertification and drought alone are estimated to cause global economic losses of over $490 billion per year.

Beyond these direct economic costs, biodiversity loss imposes incalculable opportunity costs on sectors like sustainable agriculture, medicine, and biotechnology. Species extinction represents the permanent loss of genetic resources that could yield immense future value through biomimicry, bioprospecting, or other applications we cannot yet imagine. We are irretrievably foreclosing options for human betterment.

Some criticize sustainability initiatives like SDG 15 as placing unnecessary constraints on economic activity and business interests. However, this myopic view fails to account for the immense economic risks of inaction. The degradation of terrestrial ecosystems imperils industries like agriculture, forestry, tourism, water resources, and coastal infrastructure through erosion, salinization, flooding, and climate instability. According to the World Bank, failure to promote sustainable land management could culminate in a staggering $34.6 trillion in costs from the loss of ecosystem services between 2012-2050.  

Moreover, land degradation exacerbates conflict over dwindling resources, fuels mass migration as some regions become uninhabitable, and destabilizes regional and global security. These dynamics impose immense economic disruptions and human suffering, far outweighing any perceived short-term costs of environmental stewardship.     

Understandably, developing economies may face budgetary constraints that limit investments in conservation and sustainable land management. This is why increased financial and technological support from wealthier nations and innovative public-private partnerships will be crucial mechanisms for achieving SDG 15. However, these should not be viewed narrowly as foreign aid expenditures, but as strategic investments that safeguard the global economic bedrock provided by terrestrial ecosystems.  

Transitioning to sustainable land-use practices through regenerative agriculture, forest landscape restoration, protected area management, and combating wildlife trafficking represents an immense economic opportunity as well. The World Resources Institute estimates achieving land degradation neutrality could deliver $1.4 trillion in increased agricultural productivity and $1.7 trillion from forest ecosystems services annually. It would create millions of decent green jobs while mitigating future climate, health, and humanitarian disaster costs.  

Admittedly, certain industries like extractive commodity production may face adjustment costs in the transition to sustainable practices. But history has repeatedly demonstrated that industries resisting environmental reforms routinely overestimate economic impacts while underestimating human ingenuity and the ability to develop new technologies, processes and business models when incentives align.  

As both an economist and a citizen of planet Earth, I believe achieving SDG 15 is an economic and moral imperative â€“ one that requires nations to transcend short-term self-interests and account for the true, comprehensive costs of terrestrial ecosystem degradation. Only by sustainably managing our land-based natural capital can we ensure the ecological life support systems that enabled our species' economic development remain intact for future generations.
