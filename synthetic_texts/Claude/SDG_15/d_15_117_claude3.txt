Here goes, an academic article on SDG 15 (Life on Land) as if written by Jeremy Clarkson:

Forests, Jungles and the Great Outdoors 

Listen up you tree-hugging eco-mentalists! I'm going to lay it out for you straight about this "Life on Land" codswallop they keep banging on about. 

First off, let's get one thing straight - I'm not some raving environmentalist that's going to lecture you about planting a veggie patch or hugging every redwood you see. Frankly, I couldn't give a monkeys about whales, baby seals or whatever their cause célèbre is this week. I'm here to talk about the great outdoors from the perspective of a proper petrolhead.

The world's forests, grasslands, deserts and mountains are playgrounds just waiting to be conquered - and I don't mean by a gaggle of hippie conservationists living in a tee-pee. I'm talking about the ultimate off-road adventure! Mud, grit, and pushing a 4x4 to its limits as you tear through the wilderness leaving a glorious trail of exhaust fumes in your wake. Now that's what I call communion with nature!

These great wildernesses are the last bastions for a real man to test his mettle against the raw, unforgiving force of the elements. No namby-pamby hiking trails and campsites here - I want to be forging new paths, getting stuck in quagmires, and winching my way through the densest foliage Mother Nature can muster. Scratches, dents, they're just metal and paint - battle scars to be worn with pride.  

That's why this SDG nonsense gets my dander up. All this talk of "preserving ecosystems" and "halting biodiversity loss" is just a thinly-veiled attack on our God-given right to conquer the planet. Humans have been roaming, cultivating and actively shaping the environment for millennia. It's in our very nature to bend the wilderness to our will. Otherwise, how else can we get cracking roads built through those remote valleys so I can open 'er up in my new Lamborghini Huracán?

At this point, you're probably blubbering "But think about the animals!" To which I say - animals are food, not friends. If a delicate flower or cuddly critter can't handle getting displaced or flattened by progress then it has no business traipsing through my path in the first place. This is the human realm and frankly, the sooner we assert our dominance over every square inch of the landmass the better. 

In the famous words of the great Charlton Heston: "We'll inherit the wind, the truth, and all the things that mankind is entitled to from this planet, because mankind is alone now; we're the world's highest predators. We're the most unstoppable force of life on the planet!" And you know that craggy, politically-incorrect fossil burner was absolutely bang on the money!

So there you have it, tree-tenders. This whole "sustainable land use" palaver is just more eco hand-wringing from the side of society too busy sniffing compost to understand the true meaning of being at one with nature. Real environmental stewardship means jumping in a powerful V8 and tearing through the bush - not cowering behind sustainable farming co-ops and offshore wind turbines. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to find a virgin trail to blaze. Pedal to the floor, damn the trees - full speed ahead!
