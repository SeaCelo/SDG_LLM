Here is a detailed academic article discussing SDG 15 (Life on Land) from the perspective of renowned development economist Martin Ravallion:

Safeguarding life on land is fundamental to sustainable development and reducing poverty. As an economist focused on fighting poverty through evidence-based policies, I believe that SDG 15 is inextricably linked to the key challenges facing our world today.

The degradation of terrestrial ecosystems poses an existential threat to rural livelihoods and food security in many developing countries. Unsustainable agricultural practices, deforestation, desertification, and biodiversity loss undermine the natural resource base that impoverished rural populations depend on for their subsistence. This environmental degradation creates a vicious cycle, further entrenching poverty.  

We have seen time and again that short-term resource exploitation without regard for sustainability creates long-term hardship, erodes resilience to shocks, and stymies economic mobility for the poorest. To make meaningful progress on poverty eradication as called for in SDG 1, we must recognize that the other SDGs are fundamentally interlinked and cannot be addressed in isolation.

While the conservation of forests, drylands, and biodiversity has often been viewed as a concern for environmentalists alone, we now understand that sustainable natural resource management is critical for lasting poverty reduction and shared prosperity. This is particularly salient in regions like Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of South Asia, where hundreds of millions remain in extreme poverty despite recent development gains.

There are difficult trade-offs at play. Rural populations facing endemic poverty may have little choice but to overexploit their local natural capital in the absence of more remunerative livelihood options. And restrictive conservation policies can impose heavy economic costs on communities with few viable alternatives. However, my own research has shown that more often than not, environmental degradation ends up hurting the poorest disproportionately over time.

So what can be done? The traditional economic development toolkit focused narrowly on GDP growth is insufficient. We need integrated strategies that safeguard ecological integrity while expanding sustainable economic opportunities. This means promoting climate-smart agricultural techniques, incentivizing conservation, and investing in non-farm employment so rural communities have a real choice.  

In Brazil, cash transfers contingent on forest protection have slowed deforestation. In Bangladesh and India, social forestry programs have empowered poor communities while restoring critical ecosystems. And across Africa, spreading drought-resistant crops and agroforestry systems has boosted resilience and incomes.

These are the types of innovative, evidence-based approaches we should look to scale up under SDG 15. Of course, context is key, and single-issue solutions are bound to fail. Successfully balancing conservation and sustainable development demands a holistic, carefully tailored mix of policies and investments.

The revived emphasis on biodiversity and ecosystem services has brought much-needed attention to SDG 15's aims. But as an economic development specialist, I am most inspired by the potential for well-designed environmental preservation strategies to be a central plank of poverty reduction efforts. Protecting our planet's land-based ecosystems is not a niche environmental cause; it is an essential investment in a prosperous collective future.
