The Center for Victims of Torture's mission to alleviate the suffering of torture survivors and promote human rights aligns intrinsically with the objectives of Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG 15), focused on "Life on Land." The inextricable link between environmental degradation, conflict, and human rights violations underscores the urgency of addressing land-based ecosystems' preservation.

Torture, a profound violation of human dignity, often stems from conflicts rooted in resource scarcity, land disputes, and environmental stressors. As climate change exacerbates these challenges, vulnerable populations face increased risks of displacement, exploitation, and exposure to violence. The Center's work highlights the ripple effects of environmental degradation on human security, particularly in regions where conflicts over natural resources have fueled cycles of violence and retribution.

SDG 15 recognizes the intrinsic value of terrestrial ecosystems and the essential services they provide, ranging from food and water security to climate regulation and cultural heritage preservation. Deforestation, desertification, and habitat loss not only threaten biodiversity but also undermine the livelihoods and resilience of communities, creating conditions conducive to instability and human rights abuses.

The Center's analytical report examines the nexus between environmental degradation, forced displacement, and torture. Case studies from regions like the Democratic Republic of Congo, where conflicts over mineral resources have fueled atrocities, and the Amazon basin, where Indigenous communities face violence and displacement due to illegal logging and mining, illustrate the devastating human costs of environmental exploitation.

Furthermore, the report highlights the disproportionate impact of environmental degradation on marginalized groups, including Indigenous populations, women, and children. These communities often rely heavily on natural resources for subsistence and cultural practices, making them particularly vulnerable to environmental stressors and the associated risks of violence and displacement.

The Center's analysis underscores the importance of integrated approaches that address the root causes of conflict, environmental degradation, and human rights violations. Initiatives that promote sustainable land management, responsible natural resource extraction, and inclusive decision-making processes can help mitigate tensions and empower communities to be stewards of their land and resources.

Additionally, the report emphasizes the need for robust accountability mechanisms and legal frameworks to hold perpetrators of environmental crimes and associated human rights violations accountable. Strengthening international cooperation, promoting transparency, and empowering civil society organizations are crucial steps in ensuring effective monitoring and enforcement.

Ultimately, the Center's report serves as a clarion call for a holistic approach to addressing the complex interplay between environmental degradation and human rights violations. By highlighting the devastating consequences of environmental exploitation on vulnerable populations and the perpetuation of violence and torture, the report underscores the urgency of collective action to safeguard terrestrial ecosystems and uphold the fundamental rights of all individuals.
