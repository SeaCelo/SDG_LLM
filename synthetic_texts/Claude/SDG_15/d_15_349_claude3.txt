SDG 15, the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal focused on "Life on Land," is a complex and multifaceted undertaking that demands comprehensive and holistic strategies. As the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, we recognize the immense challenges posed by biodiversity loss, desertification, and land degradation, and have prioritized this goal as a cornerstone of our sustainable development initiatives.

Our approach to SDG 15 is grounded in a deep understanding of the intricate interplay between human activities and terrestrial ecosystems. We acknowledge that the relentless pursuit of economic growth and resource exploitation has resulted in unprecedented levels of deforestation, habitat fragmentation, and species extinction. This degradation not only jeopardizes the planet's delicate ecological balance but also undermines the livelihoods and well-being of millions who rely directly on these natural resources.

To address this multifaceted challenge, our agency has adopted a holistic strategy that encompasses policy advocacy, capacity building, and grassroots community engagement. We work closely with national governments and international organizations to promote the integration of sustainable land management practices into their development policies and frameworks. This involves advocating for legal and regulatory reforms that incentivize sustainable agricultural practices, promote reforestation efforts, and establish robust protected area networks.

Recognizing that policy alone is insufficient, we also invest heavily in capacity-building initiatives that empower local communities with the knowledge, skills, and resources required to sustainably manage their land and natural resources. Our field teams work hand-in-hand with indigenous communities, smallholder farmers, and pastoralists, providing training on agro-ecological techniques, soil conservation methods, and sustainable forestry practices. By leveraging traditional ecological knowledge and blending it with modern scientific insights, we aim to foster a symbiotic relationship between communities and their surrounding ecosystems.

Furthermore, we acknowledge the critical role of ecosystem restoration in achieving SDG 15. Our agency actively supports large-scale reforestation and landscape restoration initiatives, employing innovative approaches such as assisted natural regeneration and ecosystem-based adaptation strategies. These efforts not only contribute to biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration but also enhance ecosystem resilience, mitigate the impacts of climate change, and safeguard vital ecosystem services upon which millions depend.

Underpinning our efforts is a strong commitment to cross-sectoral collaboration and partnership. We recognize that the challenges posed by SDG 15 are inextricably linked to other global development goals, such as poverty alleviation, food security, and climate action. Consequently, we actively engage with a diverse range of stakeholders, including civil society organizations, research institutions, and the private sector, to develop integrated solutions that address these interconnected challenges.

For instance, our work in the drylands of the Sahel region exemplifies this integrated approach. By combining sustainable land management practices with climate-smart agriculture techniques and livelihood diversification strategies, we have empowered local communities to adapt to the impacts of desertification and land degradation while simultaneously enhancing their food security and resilience.

As we navigate the complexities of SDG 15, we remain steadfast in our commitment to innovation and evidence-based decision-making. Our agency actively supports cutting-edge research and pilots new technologies and approaches that hold promise for sustainable land management and biodiversity conservation. From remote sensing and geospatial analysis tools to participatory mapping and community-based monitoring systems, we embrace the potential of digital technologies to enhance our understanding of terrestrial ecosystems and inform our interventions.

Moreover, we recognize the importance of quantifying and valuing the immense contributions of terrestrial ecosystems to human well-being and economic development. Through ecosystem service valuation studies and natural capital accounting initiatives, we aim to highlight the true costs of environmental degradation and the long-term benefits of sustainable land management practices. This evidence-based approach not only informs policy decisions but also serves to mobilize greater investment and political commitment towards achieving SDG 15.
