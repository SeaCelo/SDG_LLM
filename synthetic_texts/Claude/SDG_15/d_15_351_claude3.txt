Thailand International Cooperation Agency's Comprehensive Report on Sustainable Development Goal 15: Life on Land

As a nation rich in biodiversity and home to some of the world's most diverse ecosystems, Thailand recognizes the paramount importance of Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG 15), which aims to "protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss." Our nation's commitment to this goal is unwavering, and we are taking decisive actions to safeguard our natural heritage for present and future generations.

Thailand's efforts to combat deforestation and promote sustainable forest management have yielded significant results. Through a combination of stringent regulations, community-based forest management initiatives, and public-private partnerships, we have successfully reduced the rate of deforestation by over 60% in the past decade. Our reforestation programs, which prioritize native species and integrate traditional ecological knowledge, have restored vast swaths of degraded land, enhancing biodiversity and ecosystem resilience.

Recognizing the inextricable link between terrestrial ecosystems and human well-being, Thailand has implemented innovative approaches to promote sustainable land use practices. Our agricultural extension services provide smallholder farmers with training on agroforestry techniques, crop diversification, and climate-smart agricultural practices, reducing soil erosion and increasing food security. Furthermore, we have established a network of protected areas, covering over 20% of our land area, which safeguards critical habitats for endangered species such as elephants, tigers, and gibbons.

Thailand's efforts to combat desertification and land degradation have been multifaceted, combining scientific research, policy interventions, and community engagement. Our pioneering work on the use of remote sensing and geographic information systems has enabled us to monitor and mitigate the impacts of land degradation with unprecedented accuracy. We have also implemented comprehensive land management strategies that integrate sustainable land use practices, such as conservation agriculture, rotational grazing, and sustainable irrigation techniques.

Recognizing the importance of international cooperation in achieving SDG 15, Thailand has been an active participant in various global initiatives and partnerships. We have collaborated with organizations such as the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to promote regional cooperation and knowledge-sharing on issues related to biodiversity conservation, wildlife trafficking, and sustainable land management.

Despite these significant strides, we acknowledge that challenges remain. Climate change, urbanization, and unsustainable consumption patterns continue to exert pressure on our natural resources. However, Thailand remains committed to addressing these challenges through innovative solutions, rigorous scientific research, and sustained stakeholder engagement.

In conclusion, Thailand's efforts to achieve SDG 15 have been multifaceted and comprehensive, integrating environmental, social, and economic dimensions. By fostering sustainable land use practices, combating deforestation and desertification, and promoting biodiversity conservation, we are paving the way for a future where our natural heritage is preserved and our ecosystems remain resilient and productive for generations to come.
