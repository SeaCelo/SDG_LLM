Here is a mock academic article on SDG 15 (Life on Land) as if written by the controversial British columnist Richard Littlejohn:

It's the tree-huggers gone mad again with their latest barmy scheme to save the planet from "biodiversinty loss" or some such tosh. This time it's all about protecting life on land under the UNITED NAZI...oops, I mean UNITED NATIONS' daft Sustainable Development Goal Number 15. Let me break it down for you in plain English.

These environmental wackos want us to "sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss." What a blooming mouthful! So let me get this straight - we're supposed to stop chopping down trees willy-nilly, plant more of the blighters, and ensure that la-di-da rare species of slugs and newts don't become extinct?

Do these Loony Tunes eco-zealots never think about the consequences for ordinary hard-working folks? If we can't cut down forests for logging, housing developments and the odd bypass relief road, where are people supposed to live? In yurts? Are we all supposed to go back to living in caves? While I'm posing rhetorical questions, where does it end? Before you know it, they'll be demanding we stop ploughing fields to grow crops because it disturbs some threatened species of vole.

And it's not just the forests they want to "conserve" and prevent from being concreted over for retail parks. Oh no. We're supposed to fight "desertification" and "land degradation" too. Has anyone told them most of the desert areas are, well, already deserts? What are they expecting - shooting Timbuktuan tribesmen who try to graze a few scrawny goats on an ephemeral oasis? 

As for halting biodiversity loss, that's another example of eco-codswallop. I'll believe in fictional "climate change" when the Loch Ness Monster gets chucked on the endangered species list. These guys just want to protect every creepy-crawly under the sun. Well I've got news for them - species have been dying out since the dawn of time. It's just the next stage of evolution, survival of the fittest and all that.

What really gets my goat about this whole SDG 15 palaver is how it's being railroaded through by a cabal of unelected busybodies at the United Nations. That's an overseas organisation that gets far too much say over British affairs if you ask me. When will they learn to buttout? Our green and pleasant land has been managed perfectly well by farmers, planners and politicians for generations without these high-handed international meddlers sticking their oars in.

If they really want to do something useful for a change, these UN ranters should focus on protecting lands, ancient forests and endangered species in chintzypoor countries run by dictators. That way they might actually do some good for once instead of endlessly lecturing Britain on how to manage our countryside. We don't need industrial-scale environmental re-wilding schemes or vast dollops of the landscape turned into grotty rewilded nature reserves, thankyou very much.

In conclusion, while SDG 15 might sound vaguely laudable to your typical right-on liberal-elite, the reality is it's just another harebrained, internationalist scheme that threatens Britain's traditional way of life. As if hard-pressed families don't have enough to worry about with the cost of living crisis without these UN bar stewards trying to curb much-needed development because of some obscure newt. Rant over - I need a lie down in a dark room.
