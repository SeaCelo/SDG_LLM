Perpetuating the Cycle of Degradation: How Short-Sighted Policies Imperil Life on Land

By Rosa Brooks

It would be easy to look at SDG 15 - "Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss" - and dismiss it as just another well-intentioned UN platitude. We've heard it all before, right? Governments and corporations pay lip service to environmental protection while relentlessly exploiting the very resources they claim to be preserving. But something feels different this time. The risks we're facing have become so severe, so potentially existential, that even the most obdurate climate change skeptics are being forced to reckon with the costs of inaction.

The data is unequivocal: We are experiencing an unprecedented crisis of land degradation and biodiversity loss. Around 20 percent of the world's vegetated surface showed signs of degradation as of 2011. The percentage of land suffering from drought has more than doubled since the 1970s. By some estimates, we're currently losing dozens of species every single day due to human activities - an astonishing rate of extinction not seen since the demise of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. The drivers are multifaceted but well known: pollution, overharvesting, habitat destruction, invasive species, and the existential threat of climate change. 

But what's becoming increasingly clear is that this headlong rush toward ecological collapse isn't simply the consequence of greed or disconnection from the natural world. It's the predictable endpoint of a vicious cycle, deeply embedded in the operating logic of modern capitalism and nation-state politics. The extractive industries that deforest and degrade land don't exist in isolation - they are intimately enmeshed in larger economic and policy regimes that perpetuate and legitimize their behavior. Mining and logging companies maximize profits by externalizing environmental costs. Governments offer tax incentives and easy regulatory workarounds to attract investment, sacrificing long-term sustainability for short-term economic gains. Global markets hum along, buttressed by the illusion of infinite growth on a finite planet.  

Meanwhile, indigenous groups who have sustainably cultivated biodiverse ecosystems for centuries face expropriation and violence as their lands are seized for mineral extraction or monoculture agriculture. Nation-states deploy their militaries, ostensibly to preserve "peace and security," but often serving to repress environmental and land rights activists. And even well-intentioned conservation efforts frequently replicate neo-colonial power dynamics, dispossessing local populations in the name of environmental protection.    

Breaking this cycle requires rethinking the very building blocks of the global order. We need binding international agreements to hold corporations and governments accountable when they transgress sustainable use policies. We need a fundamental realignment of economic incentives to reward environmental stewardship over unconstrained resource extraction. We need a shift away from the ideology of ceaseless economic expansion, and a transition toward a regenerative, circular global economy. And perhaps most importantly, we need to empower indigenous communities on the frontlines of ecological preservation, recognizing their land rights and incorporating traditional ecological knowledge into mainstream conservation strategies.

Some may view such proposals as naively idealistic. But it's the status quo that is na√Øve - rooted in the dangerous delusion that we can eternally degrade the terrestrial ecosystems that support all life, without facing catastrophic consequences. SDG 15 demands more than a tweaking of existing systems. It requires rekindling an ethos of humility, responsibility and reverence for our ultimate source of sustenance: the living, breathing lands under our feet. To sabotage this effort through willful negligence is to unilaterally declare war on the very future of our species and countless others. Ensuring prosperous life on land may be an idealistic goal - but it's one we cannot afford to dismiss.
