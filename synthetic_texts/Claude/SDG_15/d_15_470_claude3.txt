Here is a detailed newspaper article about SDG 15 "Life on Land" as if written for Fast Company magazine:

Life Unlocked: How Protecting Nature Unleashes Innovation
By the Fast Company Editorial Team

The world's landscapes harbor secrets that could catalyze the next generation of innovations across industries. Yet this vast repository of potential breakthroughs remains largely untapped as humans push nature toward the brink. Sustainable Development Goal 15 charts an ambitious path to reverse this trend by protecting, restoring and promoting sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems. What many leaders have yet to fully grasp is that "Life on Land" isn't simply about conservation - it's actually a roadmap for unlocking novel solutions to global challenges.  

Consider the biological riches found in rainforests, which contain over half the world's plant and animal species despite covering just 6% of the planet's land surface. From towering trees producing sustainable materials to tiny frogs yielding potent antibiotics, these ecosystems are veritable treasure troves waiting to be responsibly explored. The malaria drug derived from the Madagascar periwinkle plant has already generated over $200 million in revenue. One can only imagine the advances - in medicine, engineering, computing and more - that remain hidden in the 80% of biodiversity that remains unstudied.  

The innovation payoffs of SDG 15 extend well beyond the biological realm. Ancient indigenous practices for sustainably managing forests, grasslands and drylands offer blueprints for coping with climate change and resource scarcity. These time-tested regenerative techniques, combined with new technologies, could help businesses rethink their supply chains and industrial processes. Transitioning to such nature-based solutions has immense potential to increase resilience and slash costs.

Case in point: Companies like Interface have radically reshaped their business models around biomimicry principles in pursuit of a "Mission Zero" goal by 2020. This has driven cost savings of $480 million from avoiding waste and increasing energy efficiency. Microsoft has committed $50 million to use nature's blueprints in AI development, cloud computing and data center design. Meanwhile, rural Native American communities are incubating food sovereignty models to overcome entrenched poverty, diet-related disease and environmental injustice in ways multinational food companies are studying closely.  

Of course, safeguarding biodiversity hotspots like primary forests and vital genetic resources won't come without trade-offs. Businesses benefiting from extractive activities like mining and logging will need to reinvent themselves around principles of environmental stewardship. Urban developers may face restrictions in some areas - yet this creates openings for sustainable building technologies and designs inspired by nature.         

Some incumbent leaders will lament the higher costs or complexity of change. But the savviest organizations understand that inaction is the biggest risk. They see the tremendous social, economic and competitive advantages of aligning business with safeguarding the planet's life support systems. Those that shift investment into innovations harmonizing economic growth, social progress and environmental preservation can become the Sustainable Development Engines powering a new era of global progress.
