Save the Children's analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 15: "Life on Land"

As one of the world's leading independent organizations dedicated to advancing the rights and well-being of children, Save the Children recognizes the intrinsic link between sustainable terrestrial ecosystems and the futures of millions of young lives globally. SDG 15, aimed at "protecting, restoring and promoting sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably managing forests, combating desertification, and halting and reversing land degradation and biodiversity loss," is a pivotal objective that directly impacts the health, safety, and prospects of children worldwide.

The degradation and exploitation of the world's terrestrial environments pose grave threats to children, particularly those residing in rural areas and marginalized communities that heavily rely on natural resources for their livelihoods and sustenance. Deforestation, unsustainable agricultural practices, and the encroachment of human activities into delicate ecosystems not only disrupt the ecological balance but also exacerbate poverty, food insecurity, and exposure to environmental hazards.

In many regions, children bear the brunt of land degradation, desertification, and biodiversity loss. The destruction of forests and habitats disrupts traditional sources of food, fuel, and shelter, forcing families into precarious situations and often leading to malnutrition, increased labor burdens, and disrupted education. Furthermore, environmental degradation heightens the risks of natural disasters, such as floods, landslides, and droughts, which can displace entire communities and leave children vulnerable to exploitation, disease, and trauma.

Save the Children's on-the-ground initiatives underscore the urgency of addressing SDG 15. In Sub-Saharan Africa, where over 60% of the population relies on agriculture for their livelihoods, our programs promote sustainable farming techniques, agroforestry, and community-based natural resource management. By empowering smallholder farmers, particularly women, with knowledge and tools for sustainable land use, we not only help secure food sources but also preserve vital ecosystems that provide essential services to communities.

In the Amazon rainforest, which is home to numerous indigenous communities and a biodiversity hotspot of global significance, Save the Children collaborates with local partners to support Indigenous Peoples' rights and traditional knowledge systems. These efforts aim to preserve the invaluable cultural heritage and sustainable practices that have coexisted with the forest for centuries, while also advocating for the protection of these critical ecosystems from deforestation and exploitation.

Furthermore, our interventions in regions affected by desertification, such as the Sahel region of Africa, focus on sustainable land management, water conservation, and the promotion of drought-resistant crops and livestock breeds. By equipping communities with the tools and knowledge to adapt to changing environmental conditions, we strive to mitigate the impact of land degradation on children's well-being and future prospects.

Underpinning our work is the recognition that achieving SDG 15 requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the root causes of environmental degradation, including poverty, inequality, and unsustainable development patterns. We advocate for policies and practices that prioritize the rights and participation of children and their communities in decision-making processes related to land use and conservation efforts.

Through partnerships with governments, civil society organizations, and the private sector, Save the Children champions the integration of child-sensitive approaches into national and international strategies for sustainable land management, biodiversity conservation, and climate change adaptation. By ensuring that the unique vulnerabilities and needs of children are considered, we can create a more resilient and equitable future for all.

In conclusion, Save the Children's commitment to SDG 15 is driven by the understanding that the well-being of children is inextricably linked to the health of our planet's terrestrial ecosystems. By preserving and restoring these vital resources, we not only safeguard the natural heritage for future generations but also secure the foundations for children's rights to survival, development, protection, and participation. It is a cause that demands unwavering dedication and collaborative efforts from all sectors of society, for the sake of our children and the planet they will inherit.
