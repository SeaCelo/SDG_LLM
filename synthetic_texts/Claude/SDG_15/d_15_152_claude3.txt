Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 15 on life on land, written from the perspective of Gail Collins:

The Paradox of Trees: Protecting Forests for the Planet (and Our Sanity)

By Gail Collins

You know how sometimes you get really obsessed with some incredibly specific thing? Like learning the names of all the English monarchs in order, or trying to understand the Hays Code's rules about on-screen nudity? My latest mania involves trees. Specifically, the fact that the entire planet depends on them and yet we humans spend so much time cutting them down. 

Maybe it's the pandemic making me hypersensitive to anything involving human respiration. But recently I've found myself following every story about deforestation with the anxiety of a parent whose kid didn't come home from the prom. What's happening with the Amazon? What about Indonesia? Quick, tell me again why palm oil production is worth destroying one of the world's greatest carbon sinks!

I realize these obsessions can get a bit out of of hand. (Though considerably less out of hand than the people who start believing ridiculous conspiracy theories or get hooked on trading Beanie Babies.) But with this one I'm not alone. There's an entire United Nations program dedicated to "life on land," which is about protecting biodiversity, sustainable forestry and halting the degradation of natural habitats.

Formally, it's Sustainable Development Goal 15. More informally, it's the one that reminds us that we can't breathe if we don't have some actual trees around. And it has an unnerving quality, since so much of the action we need for a sustainable future means simply stopping what we're currently doing to the environment.

Stop cutting down the rainforests to create cattle ranches and soybean fields. Stop decimating animal populations through poaching and trafficking. And for heaven's sake, stop burning fossil fuels so we can keep more carbon out of the atmosphere and prevent further climate change that threatens every ecosystem we've got.

"We cannot survive in a world of concrete," said Cristiana Pasca Palmer, who recently completed a four-year term as executive secretary of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity.

There are points of progress. The nations of the world have created about 238,000 protected areas, covering around 15% of the planet's land surface. But plants and animal species are still being lost at a rate never before seen in human history. Every time I see a story about some multinational company planning to bulldoze another huge swath of forest to grow more cash crops, I want to jump up and start blockading the bulldozers myself.

Humans have a long history of cutting down trees to get at more land for farms and grazing areas. But over the last 60 years, the rate of deforestation has accelerated drastically, largely fueled by industrialized agriculture and uncontrolled development. Once-lush regions like the Atlantic Forest in Brazil and the forests of continental Southeast Asia are gravely endangered. The impacts go far beyond the tragic losses of biodiversity, depleted soil, and threats to indigenous populations. Forests are natural filters for air, removers of carbon dioxide, preventers of flooding and soil erosion.  

Now the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says we need to start preserving and expanding the world's forests as part of the desperate effort to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. In some rich countries, forests are expanding again as marginal lands are abandoned. But in developing economies, the pressure for short-term profits from razing forestland continues to be immense. Global annual deforestation is estimated at a devastating 10 million hectares per year.

At the current rate, the world's rainforests will be largely gone within the next century. And along with them, so too will go many of the planet's most unique species, irreplaceable carbon sinks, and invaluable pharmaceutical resources. We're essentially sawing off the branch we're sitting on.

In Liberia, I visited the last remote forests where scientists think there may be undiscovered species of plants and animals. In Peru's Amazon basin, I trekked through areas controlled by criminal logging gangs that have gunned down environmental activists. I'll never forget the sickening feeling of walking through kilometer after kilometer of razed forest, everything flattened for illegal mining, farming and grazing operations.

We like to think of ourselves as the advanced, intelligent species, masters of our environment. But ultimately, we're just the idiots who couldn't figure out that we need the trees more than they need us. I have an old t-shirt from the first Earth Day back in 1970, when we were going to start fixing everything. It's pretty beat up by now. Maybe we should try again.
