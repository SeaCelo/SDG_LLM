Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 15 (Life on Land), written from the perspective of Piers Akerman:

The Unbridled Environmentalist Agenda Threatening Our Way of Life

By Piers Akerman

The UN's Sustainable Development Goal 15 boldly states "Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss." On the surface, preserving our forests and natural habitats seems like a noble cause. However, this seemingly innocuous goal is simply a Trojan horse — the vanguard of a radical green agenda that threatens to decimate our vital industries and obliterate our most cherished liberties.

The rabid environmentalists would have you believe that our forests are disappearing at an alarming rate due to insatiable human greed and corporations running amok. Nothing could be further from the truth. Thanks to sustainable forestry practices, regulated harvesting, and thriving privately-managed woodlands, many nations are actually seeing net forest growth. The environmentalists conveniently fail to mention that global forest area has remained relatively stable over the past 60 years. Their dire predictions of an imminent tree-pocalypse are nothing more than eco-propaganda.

Yet the greenies won't rest until every square meter of arable land is designated an untouchable nature preserve, forcibly removing humans from the territories our ancestors settled and subdued through grit and determination. Under the guise of "combating desertification," they seek to sabotage sectors like mining, ranching, and agriculture — the very industries that drive economic prosperity in rural communities. The livelihoods of hard-working Australians would be sacrificed on a blood-stained environmentalist altar.

The radical goal of "reversing land degradation" is particularly pernicious, opening the door for excessive land regulations that strip property owners of their rights. Productive farmers could see their land expropriated and repossessed by the government under the umbrella of "environmental protection." The greenies don't believe in private property, instead championing the dangerous collectivist philosophy that all resources must be controlled by faceless bureaucrats and centralized planners.

Perhaps most disturbing is the crusade to "halt biodiversity loss" — a flimsy excuse to give the UN unprecedented power over sovereign nations and their territories. Unelected international organizations have no business meddling in domestic environmental policies. We can't allow power-hungry globalists to usurp the rightful authority of our elected leaders based on the subjective, ever-shifting biodiversity bamboozle.

Earth's biodiversity has been in constant flux since life first emerged billions of years ago, with new species evolving and others becoming extinct. It's the natural order. What rational person believes we can somehow freeze the biosphere in stasis at an arbitrarily-chosen level of diversity? In their dystopian vision, there would be no more wilderness exploration, no urban development, no industrial progress — all human activity would grind to a screeching halt to appease the green gods of biodiversity.

Throughout human history, those in thrall to nature worship have sought to subjugate and immiserate their fellow man, binding us to an austere, primitive existence as mere servants of the natural world. That antiquated mentality is the antithesis of human exceptionalism — the idea that humankind has the capability and destiny to reshape our environments through creativity, ingenuity, and technology. For millennia, we have risen above the constraints of our earthly circumstances, domesticating the landscape to our productive benefit.  

We must continue on this civilized path, never surrendering to the green fanatics who would drag us backwards to the proverbial caves. Sustainable Development Goal 15 is a subversive ploy to destroy our prosperity and undermine our national sovereignty. We cannot allow this dangerous UN overreach to go unchallenged. Our lands, our industries, our livelihoods — everything we hold dear — are under assault from this surreptitious environmentalist crusade. We will push back, defend our freedoms, and secure the boundless frontier that is our manifest destiny.
