The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) recognizes the critical importance of SDG 15: Life on Land in achieving sustainable development and ensuring the long-term viability of our planet's ecosystems. As an organization dedicated to eradicating rural poverty and promoting inclusive agricultural transformation, we understand the intrinsic link between healthy terrestrial ecosystems and the well-being of rural communities.

The state of our planet's terrestrial ecosystems is a cause for grave concern. Deforestation, desertification, land degradation, and biodiversity loss continue to escalate at alarming rates, driven by unsustainable agricultural practices, illegal logging, mining, and urbanization. These threats not only undermine the ecological integrity of our ecosystems but also directly impact the livelihoods and food security of millions of smallholder farmers and rural communities who rely on these resources for their sustenance.

IFAD's approach to addressing SDG 15 is multifaceted, combining innovative financing mechanisms, capacity-building initiatives, and policy advocacy efforts. Through our projects and partnerships, we strive to promote sustainable land management practices, restore degraded landscapes, and empower rural communities to become stewards of their natural resources.

One of our flagship initiatives is the Adaptation for Smallholder Agriculture Programme (ASAP), which channels climate finance to support smallholder farmers in adapting to the impacts of climate change. By promoting climate-smart agriculture and landscape restoration techniques, ASAP not only enhances food security and resilience but also contributes to the conservation and sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems.

In the Sahel region of Africa, for instance, IFAD has partnered with local communities and governments to implement large-scale land restoration projects through the Great Green Wall initiative. This ambitious endeavor aims to restore degraded lands, combat desertification, and create a vast green corridor across the Sahel, providing vital ecosystem services and economic opportunities for rural populations.

Furthermore, IFAD recognizes the importance of indigenous knowledge and community-driven approaches in safeguarding terrestrial ecosystems. Through our partnerships with indigenous peoples and local organizations, we support the preservation of traditional land management practices, promote the sustainable use of biodiversity, and facilitate the integration of traditional ecological knowledge into modern conservation efforts.

One such example is our collaboration with the Quechua communities in the Andean highlands of Peru, where we have supported the revitalization of ancient agroforestry systems known as "chacras." These traditional farming practices not only enhance agricultural productivity but also contribute to the conservation of biodiversity, soil fertility, and water resources, showcasing the harmonious coexistence of rural livelihoods and ecosystem preservation.

IFAD also recognizes the critical role of women in sustainable land management and ecosystem conservation. Through targeted initiatives, we empower rural women by enhancing their access to resources, decision-making processes, and capacity-building opportunities. By promoting gender equality and the inclusion of women in natural resource management, we not only advance SDG 15 but also contribute to the broader goals of sustainable development and poverty eradication.

Looking ahead, IFAD remains committed to forging strategic partnerships and leveraging innovative financing mechanisms to support the achievement of SDG 15. We will continue to advocate for policy reforms that prioritize sustainable land management, biodiversity conservation, and the rights of indigenous and rural communities. Furthermore, we will intensify our efforts to promote nature-based solutions, sustainable agriculture, and ecosystem-based adaptation strategies, recognizing the interconnectedness of terrestrial ecosystems, climate resilience, and rural livelihoods.

In conclusion, IFAD's approach to SDG 15 is grounded in the recognition that sustainable land management and ecosystem conservation are inextricably linked to the well-being of rural communities and the achievement of the broader Sustainable Development Goals. By fostering innovative partnerships, empowering local communities, and promoting sustainable practices, we strive to create a world where terrestrial ecosystems thrive, rural livelihoods are secure, and the foundations for a prosperous and resilient future are firmly established.
