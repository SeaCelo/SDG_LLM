The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) recognizes the critical importance of Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG 15), which aims to "Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss." As a global leader in sustainable development, Sweden is committed to addressing the pressing challenges posed by ecosystem degradation, deforestation, and biodiversity loss.

The agency's efforts towards achieving SDG 15 are multifaceted and rooted in a comprehensive understanding of the intricate relationships between human activities, ecosystem health, and sustainable development. Our approach is driven by scientific evidence, cross-sectoral collaboration, and a deep respect for the rights and knowledge of indigenous communities.

One of Sida's key focus areas is combating deforestation, a major contributor to climate change and biodiversity loss. We recognize that deforestation is often driven by complex socio-economic factors, including poverty, unsustainable agricultural practices, and illegal logging. To address these challenges, Sida supports initiatives that promote sustainable forest management, agroforestry, and community-based conservation efforts. Our programs emphasize the importance of tenure rights, participatory decision-making, and the integration of traditional ecological knowledge.

Biodiversity conservation is another critical pillar of our work towards SDG 15. Sida acknowledges the intrinsic value of biodiversity and its essential role in maintaining ecosystem services that underpin human well-being. We support efforts to establish and effectively manage protected areas, as well as initiatives that promote sustainable use of natural resources by local communities. Our approach emphasizes the importance of mainstreaming biodiversity considerations across sectors, such as agriculture, energy, and infrastructure development.

Desertification and land degradation pose significant threats to sustainable development, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. Sida's interventions in this area focus on promoting sustainable land management practices, including sustainable agriculture, soil conservation, and water resource management. We work closely with local communities to develop context-specific solutions that address their specific needs and challenges, while also contributing to global efforts to combat desertification.

Recognizing the interconnected nature of the SDGs, Sida's efforts towards SDG 15 are closely integrated with other development goals, such as SDG 13 (Climate Action), SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), and SDG 2 (Zero Hunger). Our holistic approach acknowledges the complex interplay between environmental, social, and economic factors, and we strive to develop interventions that address these interconnections.

To ensure the effectiveness and sustainability of our interventions, Sida emphasizes the importance of capacity building, knowledge sharing, and multi-stakeholder partnerships. We collaborate with governments, civil society organizations, academic institutions, and the private sector to leverage expertise, resources, and innovative solutions. Our programs prioritize gender equality, human rights, and the inclusion of marginalized and vulnerable groups.

As we progress towards 2030, Sida remains steadfast in its commitment to achieving SDG 15 and contributing to a sustainable future for all. We recognize the urgency of the challenges we face and the need for transformative action. Through our collaborations, innovative approaches, and evidence-based interventions, we strive to protect, restore, and promote the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, ensuring a healthy planet for present and future generations.
