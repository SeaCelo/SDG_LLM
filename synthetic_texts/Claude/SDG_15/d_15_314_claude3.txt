In the context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG 15) focuses on "protecting, restoring, and promoting the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably managing forests, combating desertification, halting and reversing land degradation, and halting biodiversity loss." This goal is critically important for Chile, a country with rich biological diversity and a variety of unique ecosystems facing significant challenges.

At the national level, Chile has made notable progress in protecting its wild areas, which currently cover approximately 20% of its continental territory. However, the sustainable management of these ecosystems remains a challenge, particularly in conserving endangered species and mitigating the impacts of climate change.

One of Chile's greatest challenges is desertification, a process affecting a significant portion of the country's territory. Northern regions such as Atacama and Coquimbo are particularly impacted by water scarcity and soil degradation, jeopardizing local biodiversity and the livelihoods of rural communities. In response, the government has implemented soil recovery programs and sustainable water resource management initiatives, but these efforts need to be intensified and more efficiently coordinated.

Chileâ€™s native forests, stretching from the southern regions to Mediterranean zones, face threats such as deforestation, wildfires, and the spread of invasive exotic species. Despite efforts to protect and restore these ecosystems, gaps remain in the implementation of effective policies and coordination among the various stakeholders involved.

In terms of marine biodiversity, Chile boasts one of the largest marine protected areas in the world, the Nazca-Desventuradas Marine Park. However, overfishing, pollution, and climate change continue to threaten the health of these ecosystems and the species that inhabit them.

To address these challenges, Chile must adopt an integrated approach involving all sectors and levels of government, as well as local communities and private actors. Greater investment is needed in scientific research and the development of sustainable technologies, alongside increased public awareness and environmental education across society.

Strengthening international cooperation and the exchange of knowledge and best practices with other countries facing similar challenges is also essential. Chile can leverage its position as a member of regional and international organizations, such as the Pacific Alliance and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), to advance the sustainable development agenda and the protection of terrestrial ecosystems.

In summary, SDG 15 represents a significant challenge for Chile but also an opportunity to demonstrate leadership in sustainable resource management and biodiversity conservation. Through a combination of robust policies, investment in research and technology, and close collaboration with all stakeholders, Chile can move toward a more sustainable and resilient future, protecting its valuable terrestrial ecosystems for present and future generations.
