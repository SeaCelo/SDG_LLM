Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) recognizes the profound impacts of environmental degradation and biodiversity loss on global health and human well-being, particularly among the vulnerable populations we serve. As such, our organization remains deeply committed to advancing Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15: Life on Land, which aims to protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, combat desertification, and halt biodiversity loss.

The inextricable link between environmental health and human health is evident in the myriad challenges faced by the communities we work with. Deforestation, land degradation, and biodiversity loss exacerbate food insecurity, water scarcity, and the spread of infectious diseases, among other issues. For instance, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where MSF has a significant presence, rampant deforestation and habitat fragmentation have disrupted ecosystems, leading to increased human-animal interactions and the potential for zoonotic disease transmission, such as Ebola and monkeypox.

Moreover, the impacts of climate change, exacerbated by environmental degradation, have far-reaching consequences for human health. Extreme weather events, such as droughts, floods, and heatwaves, can disrupt access to clean water, sanitation, and healthcare services, as well as contribute to the spread of vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever. In Somalia, where MSF has been responding to the ongoing drought and famine, we have witnessed firsthand the devastating effects of land degradation and desertification on vulnerable populations.

Recognizing the urgency of these challenges, MSF has adopted a multifaceted approach to addressing SDG 15. First, we prioritize sustainable resource management and conservation efforts within our operational facilities and supply chains. This includes minimizing our environmental footprint through waste reduction, energy efficiency, and responsible procurement practices. Additionally, we collaborate with local communities and indigenous groups to promote traditional ecological knowledge and sustainable land-use practices, such as agroforestry and regenerative agriculture.

Furthermore, MSF actively participates in global advocacy efforts to raise awareness about the health impacts of environmental degradation and biodiversity loss. We engage with policymakers, international organizations, and other stakeholders to advocate for stronger environmental protections, sustainable resource management, and equitable access to clean air, water, and natural resources.

However, our efforts are not without challenges. Conflict, political instability, and limited resources often hinder conservation efforts and sustainable development initiatives in the regions where we operate. Additionally, the complexities of balancing environmental protection with immediate humanitarian needs and economic development priorities can pose significant challenges.

To address these obstacles, MSF emphasizes a collaborative and context-specific approach. We work closely with local communities, governments, and other stakeholders to develop tailored solutions that address both environmental and humanitarian concerns. This includes promoting sustainable livelihoods, supporting climate change adaptation strategies, and advocating for policies that prioritize environmental justice and the rights of indigenous and marginalized communities.

In conclusion, MSF's commitment to SDG 15 is rooted in our recognition that human health and well-being are inextricably linked to the health of our planet. By addressing environmental degradation, biodiversity loss, and the impacts of climate change, we can create a more sustainable and resilient future for the vulnerable populations we serve. Through a combination of on-the-ground action, advocacy, and collaborative efforts, we strive to protect and restore terrestrial ecosystems, combat desertification, and promote sustainable land management practices for the benefit of present and future generations.
