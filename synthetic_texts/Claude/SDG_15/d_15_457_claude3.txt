World Vision International's analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 15: Life on Land

The relentless degradation of terrestrial ecosystems poses an existential threat to the planet's biodiversity, jeopardizing the delicate balance that sustains life on Earth. As a global humanitarian organization, World Vision International recognizes the urgency of addressing this crisis, which disproportionately impacts the world's most vulnerable communities.

Our analysis paints a sobering picture of the current state of affairs. Deforestation, driven by unsustainable agricultural practices, illegal logging, and urbanization, continues to ravage vast swaths of forests, decimating habitats and contributing to the extinction of countless species. The Amazon rainforest, often referred to as the "lungs of the planet," has been subject to rampant deforestation, with dire consequences for Indigenous communities and the global climate.

Desertification, another pressing issue, is exacerbated by climate change and unsustainable land management practices. Arid and semi-arid regions, home to some of the world's poorest populations, are witnessing the relentless encroachment of deserts, compromising food security and livelihoods. The Sahel region of Africa serves as a poignant example, where environmental degradation, conflict, and poverty form a vicious cycle, perpetuating human suffering.

The illicit wildlife trade, fueled by organized criminal networks, has decimated populations of iconic species such as elephants, rhinos, and pangolins. This insidious industry not only threatens global biodiversity but also undermines the rule of law, perpetuates corruption, and deprives local communities of their natural heritage.

However, amidst these challenges, there are pockets of hope and progress. Community-based conservation initiatives, such as those championed by World Vision, have empowered local populations to become stewards of their natural resources. By integrating traditional knowledge with modern sustainable practices, these initiatives have proven effective in restoring degraded landscapes, safeguarding endangered species, and promoting sustainable livelihoods.

In the highlands of Ethiopia, for instance, World Vision's "Re-greening" project has facilitated the planting of millions of trees, transforming once-barren landscapes into thriving ecosystems. This initiative has not only helped combat soil erosion and restored water sources but has also provided alternative income streams for local communities through the sale of sustainable forest products.

Similarly, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, World Vision's "Green Villages" program has empowered communities to protect and sustainably manage their forest resources. By providing training in agroforestry, energy-efficient stoves, and alternative livelihood opportunities, this initiative has reduced the pressure on forests while improving food security and economic prospects for local populations.

Nonetheless, achieving the ambitious targets set forth by SDG 15 requires a concerted global effort, involving governments, civil society organizations, the private sector, and local communities. Robust policies and legislation must be enacted to curb deforestation, combat desertification, and dismantle the illicit wildlife trade. Sustainable land management practices, ecosystem restoration, and the integration of biodiversity considerations into all sectors must become the norm, rather than the exception.

Moreover, greater investment in research, capacity-building, and technology transfer is crucial to empowering communities and enabling them to become active participants in conservation efforts. Innovative solutions, such as community-based ecotourism, sustainable agricultural practices, and payment for ecosystem services, must be scaled up and replicated across diverse landscapes.

Ultimately, achieving SDG 15 is not merely an environmental imperative but a moral obligation. The fate of our planet's terrestrial ecosystems is inextricably linked to the well-being of humanity, particularly the most vulnerable populations. By safeguarding life on land, we protect the very foundation upon which our civilization rests, ensuring a sustainable future for generations to come.
