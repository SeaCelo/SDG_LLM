Safeguarding Life on Land: An Econometric Analysis of SDG 15 (by Joshua D. Angrist)

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has firmly established a comprehensive blueprint for global action to preserve our planet's terrestrial ecosystems. Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG 15), "Life on Land," encapsulates an ambitious vision to protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystems. As an applied microeconomist, I approach this multifaceted objective through the lens of causal inference, quasi-experimental research designs, and rigorous empirical analysis.

The crux of SDG 15 lies in combating the accelerating degradation of fertile soils, desertification, deforestation, and biodiversity loss â€“ calamities that profoundly impact human well-being, food security, and economic development. Tackling these challenges necessitates a nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between human activities, environmental preservation, and sustainable resource management.

To unravel these intricate relationships, I advocate leveraging natural experiments and exogenous policy shifts as instrumental variables, enabling us to circumvent the endogeneity concerns that often plague environmental studies. For instance, analyzing the staggered implementation of protected area policies across regions could unveil the causal impacts on deforestation rates, biodiversity indices, and local economic outcomes.

Furthermore, the spatial discontinuities inherent in certain environmental policies present fertile ground for regression discontinuity designs. By comparing outcomes immediately across administrative boundaries with divergent conservation policies, we can isolate the local average treatment effects, shedding light on the efficacy of interventions aimed at curbing illegal poaching, promoting sustainable agriculture, or restoring degraded landscapes.

Complementing these identification strategies, the proliferation of high-resolution satellite imagery and remote sensing data has equipped researchers with unprecedented opportunities to construct novel outcome measures and precisely monitor changes in land cover, vegetation indices, and habitat fragmentation over time. Combined with granular socioeconomic data, these spatiotemporal datasets enable us to rigorously evaluate the distributional impacts of conservation efforts and elucidate the intricate trade-offs between environmental preservation and economic development.

Moreover, the stochastic nature of extreme weather events and natural disasters presents opportunities for difference-in-differences analyses, allowing us to quantify the resilience of ecosystems and communities to climate-induced shocks. By comparing outcomes across regions that experienced differential exposure to droughts, floods, or wildfires, we can glean insights into the effectiveness of disaster risk reduction strategies, ecosystem-based adaptation mechanisms, and sustainable land management practices.

Underpinning these empirical inquiries is the recognition that the success of SDG 15 hinges on addressing the root causes of environmental degradation, which often stem from pervasive market failures, institutional deficiencies, and misaligned incentives. Through the lens of mechanism design and contract theory, we can devise innovative policy instruments, such as payments for ecosystem services, to realign individual incentives with collective conservation objectives.

Ultimately, the path toward achieving SDG 15 demands a multidisciplinary approach that harnesses the complementary strengths of economics, ecology, remote sensing, and policy analysis. By embracing the ethos of credible causal inference and leveraging cutting-edge data and empirical strategies, we can illuminate the intricate dynamics underpinning sustainable land management, informing evidence-based policymaking and catalyzing transformative action to safeguard our planet's terrestrial ecosystems for generations to come.
