Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 15 (Life on Land), written from the perspective of Nobel Laureate economist Paul R. Krugman:

Safeguarding Life on Land (SDG 15) is an imperative not just for environmental preservation, but one with profound economic implications that we ignore at our peril. As an economist, I recognize that too often we treat the natural world as an exogenous constant in our models rather than a dynamic system shaped by human activity. This short-sighted failure to account for our ecological footprint and its repercussions has saddled us with a catastrophically inefficient allocation of resources.  

The premise of the free market rests on functioning price signals to guide self-interested actors toward optimal societal outcomes. Yet when entire ecosystems and environmental services lack economic values assigned to them, the market inevitably fails. We treat the atmosphere as an open sewer for greenhouse gas pollution, and swathes of biodiversity-rich wilderness as wasteland ripe for extraction and conversion, because we don't adequately price their non-market value. This market failure is reinforced by information asymmetries, short time horizons, and a classic tragedy of the commons dynamic.

In macroeconomic terms, we are dramatically undercounting the depreciation of natural capital comprising forests, wetlands, grasslands and other terrestrial ecosystems. This oversight artificially inflates GDP while running down a critical asset base vital for any genuine, sustainable economic prosperity. Ecosystems provide renewable resources, cultural services, climate regulation, nutrient cycling and so much more that enhances productivity, health and quality of life. Destroying these natural assets for meager short-term extraction is the epitome of economic inefficiency.

The economic impacts are already manifest in the form of soil degradation reducing agricultural yields, diminished water security and quality, increased exposure to natural disasters, and loss of biodiversity undermining potential medical and scientific breakthroughs. Not to mention the existential risk of transgressing ecological tipping points that could trigger catastrophic climate shifts. The mounting costs of these impacts dwarf any specious notion that environmental protections undermine economic growth. Quite the opposite - restoring and sustainably managing terrestrial ecosystems provides an indispensable foundation for durable, resilient economic development.

Fortunately, we already possess the policy tools and economic insights to correct this solvable market failure and align incentives for better stewardship of life on land. Robust carbon pricing and ecological service payments, eliminating environmentally destructive subsidies and tax expenditures, improved land tenure and resource rights, innovation inducements, sustainable supply chain development and many other policies can unlock transformation. Rather than lament the economic challenges, we should embrace the immense opportunities in emerging ecosystems services industries, ecotourism, sustainable commodity production and so much more.

In short, SDG 15 reflects economic pragmatism of the highest order. Ignoring it risks catastrophic losses through the continued drawdown of indispensable natural capital. But with foresight and an appropriate economic policy framework, we can harmonize responsible ecosystem stewardship with lasting prosperity. It's not merely an environmental imperative - it's the only plausible path to durable, equitable economic development in the long-run.  Our free market principles demand that we accurately price the true economic value of life on land.
