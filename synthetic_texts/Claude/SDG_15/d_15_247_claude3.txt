Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 15 - Life on Land, drafted as if written by Robert W. Vishny, an economist known for his work on corporate governance and institutional theories:

The inextricable links between economic development and the proper stewardship of terrestrial ecosystems cannot be overstated. As we grapple with the existential challenge of building a sustainable future on a planet with finite resources, it is imperative that we foster robust institutions and governance frameworks to safeguard and restore the very landmasses that sustain all life.

Through the lens of institutional economics, one can discern the deep-rooted market failures and collective action problems that have precipitated the degradation, fragmentation and outright loss of forests, drylands, and other vital terrestrial habitats. The concept of the "tragedy of the commons" looms large, where individual actors, left to their own devices, will inexorably deplete shared natural resources in pursuit of narrow self-interest. This dynamic is exacerbated by perverse incentives, information asymmetries, and a lack of clearly delineated property rights and enforcement mechanisms.

However, it would be misguided to view environmental stewardship solely through the prism of market failures. The very fabric of human civilization is woven into the terrestrial ecosystems we have shaped and been shaped by over millennia. Indigenous communities, whose profound knowledge systems are inseparable from the lands they inhabit, have long served as exemplars of sustainable land management practices. Their traditional institutions for governing natural resources predate and often outperform the blunter instruments of the modern nation-state.

As such, the sustainable development agenda necessitates a fundamental reframing of how we conceptualize land ownership, usage rights, and the distribution of costs and benefits arising from conservation efforts. Novel institutional arrangements that harness the power of incentives while respecting the rights and knowledge systems of local communities are urgently needed.

One promising avenue lies in the careful crafting of payment for ecosystem services (PES) mechanisms, wherein landholders are compensated for the positive environmental externalities generated by sustainable practices. Well-designed PES programs, underpinned by credible monitoring and verification systems, could help realign economic incentives and internalize the immense value provided by healthy terrestrial ecosystems. Scaling such initiatives will require overcoming significant governance challenges related to funding, tenure rights, equity considerations, and aligning the interests of a diverse array of stakeholders.

Another critical frontier is catalyzing institutional innovations that transcend the artificial boundaries between sectors and jurisdictions. Terrestrial ecosystems do not conform neatly to the political cartographies of nation-states or the bureaucratic silos that fragment environmental policymaking. Holistic, landscape-level approaches that bring together governments, civil society, industry and indigenous groups in co-governance regimes are urgently needed to manage these interconnected systems as coherent wholes.

Ultimately, the path towards SDG 15 will demand a sweeping reimagination of humanity's relationship with the terrestrial sphere. By harnessing economic principles, institutional insights, and indigenous wisdom in equal measure, we may yet craft the governance systems capable of reversing ecological destruction and ushering in an age of restorative, regenerative stewardship of land and life itself.
