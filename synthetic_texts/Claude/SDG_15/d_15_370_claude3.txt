The International Labour Organization's (ILO) comprehensive analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15 – Life on Land – highlights the intricate connections between sustainable land management practices, biodiversity conservation, and decent work opportunities. As the United Nations' agency dedicated to promoting social justice and internationally recognized human and labor rights, the ILO recognizes the pivotal role that sustainable land management plays in ensuring sustainable livelihoods, particularly for vulnerable communities reliant on natural resources.

SDG 15 aims to "Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss." This goal is intrinsically linked to the ILO's mandate of promoting decent work and economic growth, as millions of people worldwide depend on land-based activities, such as agriculture, forestry, and eco-tourism, for their livelihoods.

The report highlights the alarming rate of land degradation and biodiversity loss, which has severe implications for employment, income generation, and food security. According to the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), around one million animal and plant species are currently threatened with extinction, many within decades. This biodiversity loss not only jeopardizes essential ecosystem services but also threatens the livelihoods of indigenous and local communities who have traditionally relied on these resources for sustenance and cultural practices.

The ILO recognizes the vital role played by smallholder farmers, pastoralists, and forest-dependent communities in sustainable land management and biodiversity conservation. These communities often possess invaluable traditional knowledge and practices that have been passed down through generations, contributing to the sustainable use and conservation of natural resources. However, these communities frequently face challenges such as insecure land tenure, limited access to markets, and inadequate social protection, hindering their ability to pursue sustainable livelihoods.

The report emphasizes the need for a holistic approach that integrates environmental sustainability, economic development, and social inclusion. This includes promoting sustainable agriculture practices, such as agroforestry, crop rotation, and integrated pest management, which not only contribute to soil health and biodiversity conservation but also provide decent work opportunities and increased productivity for smallholder farmers. Additionally, the report highlights the importance of supporting community-based natural resource management initiatives, which empower local communities to manage and conserve their natural resources while generating sustainable livelihoods.

Furthermore, the ILO advocates for the formalization and recognition of informal sector workers, such as charcoal producers, non-timber forest product gatherers, and eco-tourism workers, who often operate in precarious conditions without adequate social protection or representation. By formalizing these sectors and ensuring decent working conditions, the ILO aims to promote sustainable land management practices while providing economic opportunities and social protection for marginalized communities.

The report also emphasizes the importance of gender equality and social inclusion in achieving SDG 15. Women often play a critical role in sustainable land management and biodiversity conservation, yet they frequently face discrimination, limited access to land and resources, and inadequate representation in decision-making processes. The ILO advocates for policies and programs that address these gender disparities, empower women in land management and conservation efforts, and promote equal opportunities and rights.

In conclusion, the ILO's analytical report on SDG 15 underscores the intricate connections between sustainable land management, biodiversity conservation, and decent work opportunities. By promoting sustainable practices, supporting community-based initiatives, formalizing informal sectors, and ensuring gender equality and social inclusion, the ILO aims to contribute to the achievement of SDG 15 while simultaneously advancing its mandate of promoting social justice, human rights, and decent work for all.
