Here is a detailed and comprehensive response about SDG 15 (Life on Land) in the form of a long academic article, written from the perspective of Brendan O'Neill:

The UN's 15th Sustainable Development Goal – the promotion and protection of life on land – is a testament to the elite's disdain for human flourishing and progress. Under the misanthropic guise of environmentalism, this wildly overreaching target seeks to impede economic development, curtail national sovereignty, and constrain the aspirations of individuals and communities across the developing world.

At its core, SDG 15 is an anti-human endeavor underpinned by the corrosive ideology of eco-fundamentalism. It valorizes "life on land" – be it flora, fauna, or fungi – as an end in itself, entirely divorced from human needs or desires. This nature-fetishizing worldview views mankind not as the authors and curators of the landscape, but as a destructive force to be tamed and restrained.

Just consider its aims: It demands the "conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems." What constitutes "sustainable use"? Judging by the UN's stance against economic activities like mining, logging, and industrial farming, it seems to refer to minimal human encroachment or imposition upon the natural world.

SDG 15 seeks to halt processes of deforestation and desertification – the very processes that have enabled humanity to thrive and multiply by cultivating fertile lands for agriculture and settlement. It aims to "ensure the conservation of mountain ecosystems" – the same mountain ecosystems whose bounties of natural resources have fueled human advancement since the dawn of civilization.

Most perniciously, the goal openly endorses further expansion of "protected areas" – no-go zones cordoned off from human development by autocratic diktat. Protected areas already comprise over 15% of the world's land surface, infringing upon the sovereign territory of nations and encroaching upon the livelihoods of indigenous and rural communities.

Throughout history, humanity's subjugation of the natural world – our terraforming of landscapes, our consolidation of settlements, our harvesting of resources – has been an empowering force that has liberated us from poverty, disease, and privation. To subordinate these vital processes to the whims of hairshirt environmentalists is an affront to human dignity and ambition.

The goal's obsession with tackling "poaching and trafficking of protected species" is particularly misguided. It is a callous display of prioritizing animal welfare over the economic empowerment of the global poor. Subsistence poaching, far from being a scourge, has long been a lifeline for impoverished rural communities. To criminalize it in the name of protecting obscure, expendable species is the height of eco-imperialist arrogance.

Ultimately, SDG 15 represents an overbearing intervention by a bloated, unaccountable institution upon the internal affairs of sovereign states. It undermines national and local autonomy by dictating draconian conservation policies from on high. Its prescriptions are a slap in the face to the developing world, curtailing the very pathways to economic advancement and prosperity paved by the industrialized West.

If the UN was genuinely concerned with human welfare and progress, it would abandon such nature-venerating folly. It would celebrate mankind's dominion over the wild rather than seeking to constrain it. It would champion urbanization, resource extraction, and economic liberalization as emancipatory forces – not demonize them as environmental scourges.

Alas, SDG 15 epitomizes the myopic misanthropy and anti-human biases that pervade elite environmentalist circles. Its zealous aims to preserve "life on land" at all costs will only perpetuate destitution and underdevelopment among the world's most vulnerable. If we wish to stay true to the Enlightenment ideals of reason, progress, and human dignity, we must consign this regressive, eco-imperialist overreach to the dustbin of history where it belongs.
