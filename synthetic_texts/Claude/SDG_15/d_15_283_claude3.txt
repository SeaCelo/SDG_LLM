Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 15 (Life on Land) written from the perspective of Esther Duflo:

Protecting, restoring and promoting sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems is among the most pressing challenges we face in achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. As an empirical economist focused on randomized evaluations to understand which policies work and why, I believe we must bring rigorous evidence and economic analysis to bear on SDG 15.

Let's start with deforestation, a major driver of biodiversity loss and carbon emissions. Too often, policies aimed at curbing deforestation suffer from a thin evidence base and lack nuanced understanding of local incentives. Through careful field experiments, we've found that modest monetary payments for forest-owners to preserve their trees can be a highly cost-effective approach – but only when payments are allocated using empirical markers of high deforestation risk. Without such targeting, the same funding has little impact.

This highlights a broader failing: top-down environmental policies tend to overlook important on-the-ground realities. For instance, efforts to expand protected areas have sometimes backfired by increasing human-wildlife conflict and exacerbating poverty near park boundaries. Alternatively, randomized trials from across South Asia and Africa suggest that giving communities a larger stake in managing nearby forests tends to improve ecological outcomes.

But context is crucial. In Nepal's hills, hand-over of forestry rights sparked an astonishing revitalization of previously degraded woodlands. Yet similar initiatives fell flat in parts of India with milder pre-existing shortages. Practitioners must carefully diagnose site-specific causes of environmental mismanagement to craft appropriate solutions.

This economic, micro-empirical lens can also shed light on more foundational drivers of the biodiversity crisis, like humanity's continued growth in population, incomes and consumption. While tackling poverty must remain the overarching priority – since lack of opportunity is inextricably linked to ecosystem damage – we cannot ignore how rising prosperity in much of the world is exerting intensified pressures on wilderness areas and wildlife.

Carefully designed taxes, subsidies and other market-based instruments could help realign private incentives to protect rather than encroach upon fragile habitats. But such policies are complex, with potential unintended consequences – so again, meticulous piloting and evaluation will be vital before scaling.

Importantly, we must recognize that environmental stresses transcend borders, making international cooperation and knowledge-sharing essential. Fortunately, the proliferation of large, credible experimental research across diverse locales offers a massive opportunity. With a critical mass of location-specific insights aggregated across contexts, we can distill robust principles to guide more intelligent policymaking.

Naturally, conservation sciences and Indigenous wisdom also have vital roles to play. But too often, environmental work today is bogged down by anecdotal thinking, political squabbling, and a frustrating lack of scalable, incentive-attuned solutions. By embedding rigorous economic analysis into our SDG 15 efforts, we can finally start turning the tide.
