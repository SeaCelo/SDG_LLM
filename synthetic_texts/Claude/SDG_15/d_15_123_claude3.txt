Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 15 (Life on Land), written from the perspective of the late writer and critic A.A. Gill:

The Scorched Earth: A Polemic on SDG 15 and Our Failing Forests

By A.A. Gill

Let's start as I always prefer to - with a bit of casual racism, shall we? What could be more iconically British than ruminating on the verdant splendor of the English countryside, while lamenting the steady encroachment of urbanity and its grubby inferiors? There's something so deliciously quaint about the notion that our "green and pleasant land" remains unspoiled by the vagaries of the developing world. Forgive me, but I must chuckle at the bourgeois fantasy that our meticulously manicured gardens and private copses remain untouched by the scourge of deforestation laying waste to the Amazon rainforest.

You see, the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 15 - "Life on Land" - is one of those Orwellian constructs that reeks of cosmopolitan hand-wringing. A virtuous aim, to be sure, yet one tinged with more than a modicum of occidental hypocrisy. For who among us hasn't enjoyed the spoils of unchecked logging, unbridled mining, and the ruthless conversion of wild terrain into human habitat? Our very existence is predicated on the subjugation of the natural world. Perhaps it's a bitter pill to swallow for the Guardianista-set, but the grubby truth is that mankind's relentless march of progress has left a trail of ecological carnage in its wake.  

Take the Amazon, that lush, pungent cauldron of biodiversity that revealed its secrets to the intrepid explorers of yore. Once a verdant paradise teeming with untold botanical and zoological wonders, it has been laid siege to by the unquenchable thirst of rapacious corporations and the subsistence farmers displaced by untenable social policies. With each swath of precious rainforest laid bare, we lose entire habitats - complete micro-ecosystems of irreplaceable flora and fauna, burned to cinders on the pyre of human avarice.  

And let's not forget the mass extinction currently unfolding across the planet's wilderness areas. Countless species are being erased from existence to sate our hunger for land, lumber, and profits. It's the greatest anthropogenic depredation since...well, since the last mass extinction caused by human activity. Lest we forget, Homo sapiens are just the latest in a long line of invasive superpredators whose impact on the ecosystem has been utterly cataclysmic.  

But surely, I hear the illiterate masses protesting, measures are being taken to rectify this dire predicament? Ah yes, the grand global commitments to curbing deforestation, combating desertification, and protecting biodiversity as enshrined in SDG 15.  Pie-crust promises, brittle and insincere, that allow the self-righteous confection of "sustainability" to be thrown around with all the calorie-free zeal of a famished bulimic. 

Let's take stock of the lofty goals set forth: By 2020, we were to promote the implementation of sustainable management of all types of forests, halt deforestation, restore degraded forests and substantially increase afforestation and reforestation globally. Well, here we are in the waning months of 2020, and I don't see any sign of us reaching that laudable target. In fact, deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon hit a 12-year high last year. A dozen years of unfettered devastation while we paid lip service to ideals that remain utterly unattainable.

Then there are the goals to take urgent action to end poaching and trafficking of protected species, and to introduce measures to prevent the introduction and significantly reduce the impact of invasive alien species. Laudable rhetoric, to be sure, but does anybody truly believe these amorphous aims will be achieved in this century? Or the next? We're too addicted to the trappings of luxury goods and unchecked development to halt the wanton decimation of species.

Which brings me to my final, overarching point - the entire framework of the Sustainable Development Goals is a mere pedantic exercise designed to sate our psychological need to feel like we're making a difference. A soporific for the masses to convince themselves that the great men and women of leadership have the situation well in hand. The truth, harsh as my words may be, is that humanity has paved over the path to a sustainable future in service of our own rapacious expansion.

SDG 15 isn't worth the Bitcoin-mined paper it's printed on. Its earnest aims are the diplomatic equivalent of detritus littering the forest floor - ephemeral niceties that will be rendered obsolete by the inexorable tide of human encroachment into ever-dwindling wild spaces. We'll continue to pillage the forests, over-harvest the fauna, and disrupt the habitats until the only verdant spaces left are private foragers' gardens and the occasional rewilded urban parkette.

So by all means, continue your handwringing over sustainable land management. But don't say I didn't warn you - our frontline existence as a species is at stark odds with the natural world's capacity for renewal. We are the virus, and this planet is the host. There's only so long the antibodies can keep the infection at bay before the inevitable spread...and ultimate self-destruction of the host. My advice? Enjoy what's left of the natural amenities before we choke the last vestiges of Life on Land with our insatiable, troglodytic rapacity.
