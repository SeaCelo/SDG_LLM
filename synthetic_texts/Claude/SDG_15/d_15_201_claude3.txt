Here is a draft academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 15 (Life on Land), written from the perspective of conservative columnist Cal Thomas:

The UN's Sustainable Development Goal 15 calls for protecting, restoring and promoting sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably managing forests, combating desertification, halting and reversing land degradation, and halting biodiversity loss. While environmentalism is sometimes associated with liberal policies, conservatives have philosophical and pragmatic reasons to support SDG 15. 

From a conservative philosophical perspective, we are stewards of God's creation with a responsibility to care for the natural world and pass it along to future generations in good condition. The biblical book of Genesis describes mankind being given "dominion" over the earth's creatures, but this is a calling to wise stewardship and sustainable use of resources, not a license for unchecked exploitation. As the old conservative saying goes, "We don't inherit the earth from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children."

There are also prudent conservative economic arguments for sustainable land use and biodiversity preservation. Healthy, biodiverse ecosystems provide indispensable services like air and water purification, flood and drought mitigation, pollination for agriculture, and resilience against shocks and stresses. Unsustainable practices that damage or deplete natural capital make us all poorer in the long run. We must invest in conservation as we would invest in maintaining any other critical asset.

Some conservatives may object that environmental restrictions hamper economic growth, private property rights, and individual liberty. But true conservatism seeks to balance freedom and virtue, rights and responsibilities. Just as we regulate other aspects of economic activity like worker safety, truth in advertising, and financial fraud to uphold the common good, so too must we create sensible guardrails around land use. An untrammeled "freedom" to overhunt, overgraze, log indiscriminately, or foul our own nests is a form of tragically short-sighted self-destruction.

The good news is that market-based approaches can be powerful tools for incentivizing sustainable land stewardship and achieving SDG 15's targets. Well-designed eco-labeling, environmental taxes, cap-and-trade systems, conservation offsets, habitat banking, and payments for ecosystem services have all shown promise when applied in the right contexts. These mechanisms harness Adam Smith's "invisible hand" to properly value nature's services instead of treating them as free goods that get tragically overexploited.

The alternative, more conventional command-and-control approaches including publicly-owned lands, hunting/logging bans, and heavy-handed regulation also have an important role to play in conservation and sustainable use. But these tend to be less efficient, more bureaucratic, and more susceptible to cronyism and fraud. As with all government interventions, such measures should be the exception rather than the norm.

At the end of the day, SDG 15 resonates with core conservative values like moral stewardship, long-term thinking, respect for private property rights balanced with responsibilities, and faith in properly-functioning free markets. Sustainable land use isn't some whimsical pet cause, but a critical investment in the future prosperity of humanity and the world we are charged with protecting. We must be careful students of creation's resources and uses, and wise stewards working to keep every part of the global garden in good bloom.
