Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 15 (Life on Land) from the perspective of Elizabeth Farrelly:

The Landscape's Cry for Mercy: Answering SDG 15's Call to Revere the Land

By Elizabeth Farrelly

The drumbeat of species extinction echoes through our age like the elephants' mournful lament for their slaughtered kin. With each acre of wilderness bulldozed, each river drained of life, each forest turned to sawdust, we inflict fresh wounds upon this abused planet that has nurtured us since the dawn of humanity. The 15th Sustainable Development Goal demands urgent action to "protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss." Yet behind these worthy aspirations lies an existential call to recalibrate our relationship with the land itself.

We are ground-dwellers, born of the soil, woven from the same humble carbons, nitrogens and clays as every beast and blade of grass. To turn our back on this primordial kinship, to recklessly diminish and denude the living mantle of our only home, is an act of ecocidal self-destruction as profound as a suicide pact. Have we grown so arrogant, so alienated from our rootstock, that we ignore the landscape's cry for mercy?

It is a cry rising now from the scorched Murray-Darling basin, where once fertile plains wither from a thousand incisions – mines, factories, superhighways scarring the flesh. It echoes across the Amazon's lungs, her living greenery suffocating in smoke and shorn to bleeding stumps by the relentless hunger of commerce. This ancient motehrland, which sculpted our forms and sparked the first flint of consciousness, sobs through clear-cut temperate forests as hillsides crumple, and canyons choked with post-industrial refuse entomb what once was paradisal.

Our age has rendered terra firma an artifact of itself; a museum landscape behind velvet ropes to be admired from the mezzanine of civilization's ever-expanding edifice. We revere the great wilderness cathedrals – Yellowstone, the Serengeti, Uluru – yet everywhere remorselessly replace symbiotic ecologies with sanitized monoculture and monotony. Whole bioregions – the lush valleys of Laos, the primeval majesty of Borneo, the Antarctic ice shelves calving into oblivion – ebb away into the unquiet darkness of the Holocene extinction.

Even the soil itself, that humble underfoot matrix from which all terrestrial miracles arise, has become a geologic slaughterhouse drained of vitality in our blind stampede for temporary abundance. Through industrial desertification, salinization, and a thousand pollutants, we gnaw at the very foundations of the land systems that sustain a quarter of known species. It seems our only relationship to terra firma is as a cut-and-fill contractor.

Yet, an elemental truth endures; we are of the land indivisible. We are it singing to itself, metabolizing the vegetative wonder through manifold bodies and becomings. Heal the land, the mystics whisper, and you heal yourself. Align with her primordial cadences, her natural unities, and our rootless sickness finds its antidote in flora, fauna, and the company of living creatures. SDG 15 is not a target to be struck but a reclamation of kinship— a call to once again be landlings in the richest sense.

This reunion can take myriad forms, from the grandest gestures of wilderness preservation and ecological restoration to the humblest of urbanささやきみちみち。 It means letting landscapes breathe freely again, unravaged and unmechanized, with their richnesses allowed to express themselves in all their fecund diversity. It means fostering the revival of threatened habitats and keystone species through precisely-tailored policies and rewilding projects.  It means fighting commodification ofぶんじんs of the natural commons through bioprospecting, privatization and ecocidal extractivism. Perhaps most radically, it means breaking industrial culture's habit of relating to landscapes as Resourcências to be cynically sapped, and recovering the animistic reverence that wisdom traditions have never abandoned.

SDG 15 is no less than an appeal to shed the illusion that we stand apart atop some humanist pyramid, and rejoin the community of terrestrial life. It is a reminder that we are landbound creatures with roots and microbiomes, hungry for sustenance of the body and soul that only a rich, biodiverse earth can provide. After so much taking, conquering and disfiguring, the way must now be made for thanksgiving, for learning to graciously receive Earth's gifts and participate with care in her rhythms and homeostasis.

As our cities and cultures grow ever more landless and synthetic, we would do well to heed the territorial imperative of Goal 15. For in its vision of restored deserts and forests, peaceable beings sharing commons, and a living soil teeming with mysteries, we may just find the path to becoming native to this wondrous planet once again.
