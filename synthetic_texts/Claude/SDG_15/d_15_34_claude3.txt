UNCTAD's Analytical Report on SDG 15: Life on Land, with a Focus on Least Developed Countries, Small Island Developing States, and Landlocked Developing Countries

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development recognizes the intrinsic link between human well-being and the health of terrestrial ecosystems. SDG 15, "Life on Land," aims to halt and reverse land degradation, combat desertification, and promote the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, including forests, wetlands, and mountains. This goal is particularly crucial for least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs), as their economies and livelihoods are heavily dependent on natural resources and vulnerable to environmental degradation.

LDCs face unique challenges in achieving SDG 15 due to their limited financial and technical capacities, as well as their high vulnerability to climate change impacts. Many LDCs are located in arid and semi-arid regions, where desertification, land degradation, and drought pose significant threats to agricultural productivity, food security, and rural livelihoods. For instance, in the Sahel region of Africa, where several LDCs are located, desertification has led to the loss of fertile land, exacerbating poverty, food insecurity, and conflicts over scarce resources.

SIDS, on the other hand, face existential threats from sea-level rise, coastal erosion, and extreme weather events, which can severely impact their terrestrial ecosystems. The limited land area and fragile natural environments of SIDS make them particularly vulnerable to invasive alien species, habitat loss, and biodiversity loss. For example, the Pacific island nation of Palau has lost a significant portion of its coral reefs due to ocean acidification and warming, threatening its marine and coastal ecosystems.

LLDCs face unique challenges in achieving SDG 15 due to their geographic isolation and dependence on transit countries for trade and access to international markets. This isolation can hinder their ability to access international financing, technology, and markets for sustainably-produced goods and services. Many LLDCs are also landlocked due to their arid or semi-arid climates, which exacerbates land degradation and desertification.

To address these challenges, UNCTAD emphasizes the need for a comprehensive and integrated approach that addresses the root causes of environmental degradation while promoting sustainable economic development. This includes:

1. Strengthening institutional and legal frameworks: LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs often lack robust institutional and legal frameworks for sustainable land management, conservation, and environmental protection. Capacity-building and technical assistance are crucial to developing and enforcing effective policies, regulations, and governance structures.

2. Promoting sustainable land management practices: Investing in sustainable agriculture, agroforestry, and land restoration techniques can help combat land degradation, desertification, and biodiversity loss. This includes promoting climate-smart agriculture, sustainable forest management, and ecosystem-based adaptation strategies.

3. Enhancing access to finance and technology: Achieving SDG 15 requires significant financial and technological resources, which are often lacking in LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs. Innovative financing mechanisms, such as green bonds, blended finance, and public-private partnerships, can help mobilize resources for sustainable land management initiatives. Additionally, technology transfer and capacity-building programs can facilitate the adoption of sustainable practices and technologies.

4. Promoting sustainable value chains and green economies: LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs can leverage their rich biodiversity and natural resources to develop sustainable value chains and transition towards green economies. This includes promoting sustainable tourism, eco-labeling, and the development of sustainable products and services.

5. Strengthening regional cooperation and partnerships: Regional cooperation and partnerships can facilitate knowledge-sharing, resource pooling, and coordinated efforts to address transboundary environmental challenges. Regional organizations and initiatives, such as the Great Green Wall for the Sahara and Sahel Initiative, can play a crucial role in promoting sustainable land management and combating desertification.

6. Mainstreaming gender and social inclusion: Women and marginalized communities often bear a disproportionate burden of environmental degradation and are crucial stakeholders in sustainable land management. Mainstreaming gender and social inclusion in policies and programs can enhance their effectiveness and ensure equitable access to resources and decision-making processes.

By implementing these strategies, LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs can make significant progress towards achieving SDG 15 and promoting sustainable development. However, this requires strong political commitment, international cooperation, and sustained efforts to address the underlying drivers of environmental degradation, such as unsustainable production and consumption patterns, climate change, and poverty.

UNCTAD recognizes that achieving SDG 15 is not only an environmental imperative but also an economic necessity for LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs. Healthy and productive terrestrial ecosystems are crucial for sustaining livelihoods, promoting food security, and supporting economic activities such as agriculture, forestry, and tourism. By investing in sustainable land management and promoting green economies, these countries can unlock new opportunities for sustainable economic growth, job creation, and poverty reduction, while safeguarding their natural capital for future generations.
