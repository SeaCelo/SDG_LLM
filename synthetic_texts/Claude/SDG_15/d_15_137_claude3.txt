Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 15 (Life on Land) from the perspective of writer Andrew Sullivan:

Stewardship of the Land: A Moral and Existential Imperative

By Andrew Sullivan

The international community's embrace of the Sustainable Development Goals represents one of the most ambitious and vital initiatives for preserving the fragile biosphere we all inhabit. Of the 17 SDGs, number 15 - "Life on Land" - is perhaps the most profound and far-reaching in its implications. How we treat the terrestrial environments that have cradled human civilization will determine not just the viability of other SDGs, but the very future of our species.

At its core, SDG 15 demands that we fundamentally re-evaluate our relationship with the natural world and upend the dominant Western philosophical tradition that has viewed the Earth merely as an inert resource to be exploited. This extractive mindset has led us to the brink of ecological cataclysm through deforestation, ecosystem destruction, biodiversity loss, and soil degradation. The grim reality is that a staggering one million plant and animal species face extinction due to human activity.  

As J. Baird Callicott and other environmental ethicists have compellingly argued, we must move beyond the anthropocentric biases of Western ethics and adopt a more ecocentric framework that recognizes the intrinsic value of all life. The great folly of modernity was believing we could subjugate nature to tame it for our exclusive benefit. We now face the consequences of that hubris.

Implementing SDG 15 is not just about preserving endangered species and shielding forests from the indignities of slash-and-burn agriculture, mining, and illegal logging (though these are crucial aims). It is a complete revision of how we relate to the land, one rooted in humility and reverence. We must enshrine the ethical conviction that the Earth's splendid panorama of life has value in itself, irrespective of its use to humankind. 

This shift in consciousness does not mean embracing an absolutist dogma that prohibits any interaction with terrestrial ecosystems. Indigenous peoples have long shown it is possible to sustainably manage and steward lands in a way that enriches rather than degrades them. SDG 15's targets of restoring degraded forests, halting desertification, and protecting mountain ecosystems align with time-honored practices of traditional ecological management.

The impetus for respecting the sanctity of terrestrial life emerges not just from the moral realm, but from the existential necessity of our species' survival. We are utterly dependent on the services provided by healthy ecosystems - pollination, water filtration, carbon sequestration, soil formation, and more. Eroding these ecosystems poses grave risks not just to human welfare but to the web of life itself.  

Human civilization arose from the land. The great spiritual and philosophical traditions were shaped by profound connections to place and ecology. As our modern technological society has divorced us from that primordial bond, we have become alienated from the transcendent reality that life on this planet is a soul-sculpting miracle and existential blessing. 

SDG 15 confronts us with the most elemental of questions: What do we owe the Earth? What obligations are owed to the vast community of living beings that share this world? As we enter an age of climate calamity and ecological unraveling, achieving the vision of SDG 15 is not just about protecting plants and animals. It is about rediscovering our own meaning, roots, and collective humanity. Succeeding will require a revolution of the spirit and consciousness to match the transformative policies and actions demanded by this imperative goal.
