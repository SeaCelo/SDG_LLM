Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 15 (Life on Land) in the style of advice columnist Carolyn Hax:

We Need to Care More About the Land Beneath Our Feet

Hi, Carolyn: I know climate change is a huge issue, but I'm honestly more worried about losing my job or not being able to pay my bills than I am about polar bears and rainforests. Am I being selfish? How can I get motivated to care about something that feels so abstract and disconnected from my daily life?

Carolyn says: I completely understand why protecting life on land may not feel like an urgent priority when you're struggling to keep a roof over your head and food on the table. The biodiversity crisis and ecosystem degradation can seem like abstract, faraway problems when you have much more immediate concerns. But the truth is, the health of the land is inextricably linked to human wellbeing and survival.  

Think about it â€” land provides us with food, fresh water, medicines, energy sources, building materials and so much more that we take for granted. An estimated 80% of the human diet comes from plants and a third of our food relies on pollination by birds, bats and insects like bees. Just in the U.S., pollination is valued at over $15 billion per year. Ecosystems like forests and wetlands also play a crucial role in regulating our climate, providing flood and disease control, and serving as cultural and recreational spaces.

So when we allow deforestation, desertification, land degradation, biodiversity loss, and poaching to run rampant, we're essentially sawing off the branch we're sitting on. It's not just far-off species and landscapes at risk, it's the foundation of our livelihoods, economies, and quality of life. Indigenous communities who live in close connection with the land are especially vulnerable.

Already, land degradation has reduced the productivity of 23% of the global terrestrial area, and between $235 billion and $577 billion in annual global crop output is at risk due to pollinator loss. By one estimate, we're currently using the equivalent of 1.7 Earths to provide the resources we use and absorb our waste. If we continue on this path of taking nature and its services for granted, we're heading for "a ghastly future of mass extinction, cities frapped by rising seas, and millions dispossessed and struggling."

What's my point here? Protecting life on land isn't some optional beautification program. It's a matter of existential necessity. We need to conservation and sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems to be able to thrive -- not to mention survive -- on this planet in the long run. 

You might feel disconnected from the Amazon rainforest, but that seemingly remote wilderness is deeply connected to the farmers who grow our food, the fishermen who depend on rainwater feeding rivers, and the air you breathe. It may not be as viscerally compelling as putting food on your table today, but losing a functional biosphere and fertile lands is the fast track to global food and water shortages down the line.

Of course, it's the world's poor and most marginalized who bear the brunt of land degradation first. Overexploitation and unsustainable agricultural practices frequently lead to cropland degradation and soil erosion in the developing world. This decreases yields, erodes food security, and perpetuates a vicious cycle of poverty and land mismanagement.

As a global community, we need to scale up sustainable land-use policies, environmental protection efforts, conservation incentives, strategic reforestation initiatives and landscape restoration projects. We need to confront the direct drivers like agriculture, mining, infrastructure and urban expansion as well as indirect drivers like governance issues, demographic changes, and economic priorities that undervalue environmental capital. Individuals -- even those feeling economically strained -- can choose to eat less meat, reduce food waste, use fewer disposable plastics, support eco-friendly companies and make sustainable consumer choices.

So no, you're not being selfish for feeling disconnected from this issue in your day-to-day reality. But I would urge you to make the mental connection between your immediate surroundings and humanity's complete dependence on functional landscapes andriobversity. We're all part of an intricate global ecosystem whether we realize it or not. Ensuring prosperous and productive lives for ourselves and future generations requires us to be much better stewards of the land that anchors human civilization.
