Here is a detailed newspaper article about SDG 15 (Life on Land), written as if for Bloomberg Businessweek:

The Trillion Dollar Pursuit to Protect Life on Land

Amid the hustle of quarterly earnings reports and heated trade negotiations, one issue has emerged as a sleeping economic giant that businesses can no longer ignore: protecting the world's lands and forests. SDG 15 - Life on Land, part of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, is a sweeping call to conserve and restore the use of terrestrial ecosystems like forests, wetlands, drylands and mountains. While initially viewed as a lofty environmental goal, an alarming body of research reveals that jeopardizing land-based ecosystems carries a profound threat to global prosperity.

Consider this: Roughly half of the world's GDP, a staggering $44 trillion, is derived from industries like agriculture, construction, food and extractives that rely directly on land-based natural capital. Yet a third of the world's lands are already degraded, with the alarming pace of deforestation, desertification and habitat conversion showing no signs of slowing. The economic fallout from this degradation is estimated to be a mind-numbing $10 trillion per year by 2030 - the equivalent of nearly 10% of global GDP today.

"We typically think of land as a sunk asset on the balance sheet," says Jane Soames, partner at KPMG UK. "But it's become glaringly apparent that land is perhaps the most vital asset class underpinning the entire economy. Degrading it relentlessly is a systemic risk to business resilience, food security, climate stability and future growth models."

Industries on the Front Lines 
For agriculture and forestry companies, life on land is inherently linked to their bottom line. According to research from EY, degradation of pollinator habitats represents a $235-$577 billion annual risk to global crop output. Meanwhile, continued habitat loss is projected to put two-thirds of African companies sourcing natural capital inputs out of business in the next 30 years.

"The business case is black and white," says Miguel Veiga Pestana, SVP of Corporate Affairs at Unilever. "Building sustainable land use practices isn't just about being green - it's about future-proofing our supply chains and ensuring a viable planet to keep selling our products."

While the connection may seem less obvious, even sectors like technology, retail and finance are recognizing they have a vested interest in SDG 15's success. Many global distribution networks run through threatened biodiversity hotspots, leaving supply chains vulnerable. Banks and insurers are cognizant that eroding land capital elevates systemic risks to their portfolios. And the growing eco-tourism market means missed revenue opportunities if forests, savannas and wildlife habitats deteriorate.

A Trillion Dollar Opportunity
Managing this monumental land crisis represents perhaps the greatest economic opportunity of our era. A landmark study by the UN Convention on Biological Diversity estimates that investing $300-$400 billion annually into sustainable forestry, agriculture and land use practices could generate $6.3 trillion per year in increased ecosystem services globally by 2050. Suddenly SDG 15's vision sounds like a tantalizing value proposition for the private sector.

Leading companies are rising to the challenge. Tech giants like Google and Microsoft are financing tree planting and greening initiatives, generating offsets while restoring degraded lands. Fashion houses like Kering and Chanel are developing environmental profit and loss statements to measure the land use impacts baked into their supply chains. And emerging land asset management funds are channeling private capital into preserving biodiverse ecosystems, generating profits from ecosystem services like carbon credits.

Governments are creating investment-grade policy frameworks like natural capital accounting and revamped land tenure laws to incentivize sustainable land use. And innovative fintech solutions like IBAT, IRIS and GEO are emerging to pinpoint land degradation risks and price that data into corporate decision-making processes.  

"We're at a tipping point where the economic imperative to safeguard life on land has become undeniable," says Soames. "But businesses have also realized that being part of the solution represents one of the greatest commercial opportunities of the 21st century. Those that move first will reap immense strategic advantages." 

As the maxim goes, they're not making more land. In a world where economic prosperity is inextricably tied to natural capital, businesses have every financial incentive to champion SDG 15 and ensure that life on land endures for generations to come.
