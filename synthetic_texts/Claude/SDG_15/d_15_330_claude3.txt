The Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) is pleased to present this comprehensive analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15: "Life on Land." This goal aims to protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, and halt biodiversity loss. 

As a nation with a rich natural heritage and a deep commitment to sustainable development, Korea recognizes the critical importance of preserving and restoring our planet's terrestrial ecosystems. Our analysis reveals a complex interplay of challenges and opportunities in achieving SDG 15, requiring a multifaceted approach that addresses ecological, socioeconomic, and governance factors.

Biodiversity loss remains a pressing global concern, with species extinction rates accelerating at an unprecedented pace. Habitat degradation, fragmentation, and loss, primarily driven by unsustainable agricultural practices, urbanization, and resource extraction, continue to threaten the survival of numerous plant and animal species. Korea, with its unique geography and diverse ecosystems, is not immune to these threats. Our native species, such as the Korean red-crowned crane, the Amur goral, and the Korean fir, face increasing pressure from human activities and climate change.

Addressing deforestation and promoting sustainable forest management is a key priority under SDG 15. Forests play a vital role in mitigating climate change, preserving biodiversity, and supporting rural livelihoods. While Korea has made significant strides in reforestation efforts, with over 63% of its land area now covered by forests, illegal logging and unsustainable practices in other parts of the world remain a major concern. KOICA recognizes the need for international cooperation, capacity-building, and technology transfer to support sustainable forest management, particularly in developing nations.

Land degradation, including desertification and soil erosion, poses a severe threat to food security, water availability, and ecosystem resilience. Climate change exacerbates these challenges, leading to prolonged droughts, intensified sand and dust storms, and increased risk of natural disasters. KOICA is committed to supporting initiatives that promote sustainable land management practices, such as agroforestry, soil conservation techniques, and integrated watershed management. These efforts are crucial for enhancing the resilience of vulnerable communities and safeguarding their livelihoods.

Effective implementation of SDG 15 requires a multidisciplinary approach that addresses the complex interplay of social, economic, and environmental factors. KOICA recognizes the need for robust governance frameworks, inclusive stakeholder engagement, and strengthened institutional capacities to ensure sustainable management of natural resources. We actively support capacity-building programs that empower local communities, promote indigenous knowledge, and foster collaborations between government agencies, civil society organizations, and the private sector.

Furthermore, KOICA acknowledges the critical role of innovative technologies and approaches in achieving SDG 15. From remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) for monitoring and mapping terrestrial ecosystems to advanced genetic techniques for conservation and restoration efforts, we are committed to leveraging cutting-edge technologies to drive sustainable solutions.

In conclusion, SDG 15 represents a critical challenge for the global community, requiring concerted efforts and unwavering commitment from all stakeholders. KOICA remains dedicated to supporting initiatives that protect, restore, and promote the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, combat desertification, halt biodiversity loss, and ensure a thriving natural environment for present and future generations.
