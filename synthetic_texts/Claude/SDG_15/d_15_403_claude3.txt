As a global leader in humanitarian aid and sustainable development, Catholic Relief Services (CRS) recognizes the intrinsic link between preserving terrestrial ecosystems and the well-being of vulnerable communities worldwide. SDG 15, "Life on Land," serves as a clarion call to action, underscoring the urgency of safeguarding our planet's biodiversity and promoting sustainable land management practices.

CRS's unwavering commitment to this goal is deeply rooted in the Catholic social teaching of caring for God's creation and upholding the dignity of every human life. Our organization understands that the degradation of terrestrial ecosystems not only threatens the survival of countless species but also exacerbates poverty, food insecurity, and socio-economic instability, disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable populations.

Through our extensive global network and long-standing partnerships with local communities, CRS has witnessed firsthand the devastating impacts of deforestation, desertification, and land degradation. In regions like the Sahel, where arid and semi-arid landscapes are increasingly susceptible to drought and resource scarcity, we have implemented integrated natural resource management programs that empower communities to adopt sustainable agricultural practices, promote soil and water conservation, and restore degraded lands.

One such initiative is the Agro-Pastoral Field School (APFS) approach, which combines traditional ecological knowledge with modern agricultural techniques. By fostering farmer-to-farmer learning and encouraging the adoption of climate-smart practices, APFS has not only enhanced food security but also contributed to the restoration of degraded lands, promoting biodiversity and resilience against environmental shocks.

In the Amazon Basin, CRS has collaborated with indigenous communities to promote sustainable forest management and protect their ancestral territories from illegal logging and deforestation. Our efforts encompass supporting community-based monitoring systems, strengthening land tenure rights, and facilitating sustainable livelihood opportunities, such as agroforestry and non-timber forest product enterprises.

Furthermore, CRS recognizes the inextricable link between biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation. Through our reforestation and afforestation initiatives, we have facilitated the planting of millions of trees, not only restoring degraded landscapes but also sequestering carbon and mitigating the impacts of climate change. Our approach emphasizes the involvement of local communities, ensuring that they benefit from these efforts through improved ecosystem services, income generation, and enhanced resilience.

Recognizing the multifaceted nature of SDG 15, CRS has also championed the prevention and control of invasive alien species, which pose a significant threat to native ecosystems and biodiversity. Our interventions involve raising awareness, promoting biosecurity measures, and supporting community-led efforts to monitor and manage invasive species.

Importantly, CRS acknowledges the critical role of cross-sector partnerships and collaboration in achieving SDG 15. We actively engage with governments, civil society organizations, academic institutions, and the private sector to foster knowledge exchange, leverage resources, and amplify our collective impact. By aligning our efforts with national and international frameworks, we contribute to the global momentum towards sustainable land management and biodiversity conservation.

As we navigate the complex challenges posed by environmental degradation, climate change, and biodiversity loss, CRS remains steadfast in our commitment to SDG 15. We recognize that preserving terrestrial ecosystems is not only an environmental imperative but also a moral obligation to safeguard the well-being of present and future generations. Through our integrated and community-driven approach, we strive to promote sustainable land management practices, restore degraded landscapes, and empower vulnerable communities to become stewards of their natural resources, ensuring a more resilient and prosperous future for all.
