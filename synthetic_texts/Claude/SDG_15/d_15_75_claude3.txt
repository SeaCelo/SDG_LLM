Here is a long academic article on the Sustainable Development Goal 15 concerning life on land, written from the perspective of Mark Steyn:

The New Environmental Colonialism: How Global Elites Conquered Nature  

By Mark Steyn

The arrogance is staggering. Under the lofty canopy of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, a new skirmish has been launched in the oldest of man's battles - our restless insecurity at the vagaries of the natural world. SDG 15 pledges to "protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss." In other words, it's the doctrine of the anointed urbanite brie-eaters annexing the wild frontier and imposing their bureaucratic diktats on the free peoples who actually dwell among the flora and fauna.  

The audacity of these eco-meddlers! For millennia, indigenous peoples have lived in harmony with their natural environments, cultivating traditions of sustainable stewardship passed down through the generations. But now the cloud-pondering progressives have decreed a centralized, one-size-fits-all plan to micromanage every square inch of the planet. SDG 15's targets read like a rapacious occupation force subjugating the wilderness, with their schemes for "integrating ecosystem and biodiversity values into development planning" and the sinister objective to "mobilize significant resources from all sources" for their green jihad.  

Make no mistake, these goals represent a naked power grab by an unelected supranational oligarchy motivated more by ideological zealotry than any true concern for the environment. The conceit that a coterie of Davos dandies can decree "sustainable" forestry practices superior to those developed by ancient woodlanders is the height of metropolitan hubris. Their diversity tokenism even extends to plants and animals, with targets fetishizing "fair and equitable sharing of benefits" from genetic resources as if cross-pollinating crops is the new Check Your Privilege paradigm.

Perhaps the most galling component of SDG 15 are the paeans to "community participation" and "traditional knowledge" with regards to conservation efforts. How generous of the green-smocked sovereigns to regally bestow their seals of approval on the quaint folkloric lore of the simple aboriginals. What boundless noblesse oblige to deign to not completely eradicate indigenous ways of life. For the moment.

The bald imperiousness cloaks itself in the pious raiments of saving nature, but it's the same old song of superior civilizations playing generational arbitrage by mortgaging the future. SDG 15 has more to do with securing future revenues and territorial conquests than protecting biodiversity. At its core is the modern progressive's obsession with enforcing a global monolith at the expense of humans living actual human lives. The green utopians see mankind not as cultivators of the earth able to responsibly harvest its bounties, but as leeching parasites consuming resources more virtuously allocated elsewhere. 

If climate change is truly an "existential threat to human existence" as the apocalypse evangelists wail, why place such self-inflating emphasis on protecting plant and animal species? Is not humanity the most precious and irreplaceable resource on this terrestrial orb? Shouldn't our energies be focused on shoring up resilient human communities able to mitigate even the most extreme natural dislocations, rather than squandering wealth tilting at the windmills of hypothetical species extinction?  

In the end, SDG 15 represents not true environmentalism, but the overcompensating fervor of declinists determined to put mankind in his place. Having severed themselves from any civilizational inheritance or filial obligation, the managerial elite instead embrace the anti-human nihilism of a disenchanted world. In seeking to dominate the natural bounty like so many old-world potentates, they reveal themselves as feudal overlords of a new environmental feudalism.
