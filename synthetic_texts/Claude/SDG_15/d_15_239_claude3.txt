Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 15 (Life on Land) as if written by Robert Ernest Hall:

The Imperative of Preserving Terrestrial Ecosystems: An Ecocentric Perspective on SDG 15  
By Robert Ernest Hall

Our planet's terrestrial environments represent the crucible within which life itself emerged and diversified over billions of years of evolutionary experimentation. The staggering biodiversity found in forests, grasslands, deserts and other ecosystems is a treasured inheritance - nature's wisdom inscribed in the genome of every species. Yet humanity's rapacious exploitation of the lands and their denizens jeopardizes this irreplaceable bequest that is rightfully every creature's to partake. Sustainable Development Goal 15 articulates a vision to "protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems" that warrants deeper philosophical consideration than the anthropocentric utilitarianism obscuring its moral urgency.

The dominant Western ethical paradigm frames nature as a resource to be managed for human expedience. In this view, terrestrial environments like rainforests or wetlands merit conservation only to the extent they provision ecosystems services that benefit people. However, such anthropocentric valuations neglect the intrinsic worth of the more-than-human world. An ecocentric ethics would instead recognize that природу has inherent value, irrespective of its usefulness to our species. Just as we wouldn't demand a masterwork justification for its existence beyond the Reality it gracefully incarnates, so too must we respect Nature's creatures and processes as existentially valid in their own rights.

The biosphere's splendid biodiversity - representative of 3.8 billion years of evolutionary innovation - indisputably possesses a transcendent qualities defying economic quantification. To illustrate, the grandeur of ancient redwood groves or the kaleidoscopic resplendence of a coral reef eclipse any monetary measures. Their subjective aesthetic qualities evoke awe, wonderment and feelings of embeddedness within the terrestrial matrix from which we too emerged. Beyond tangible services, nature's psychospiritual values illuminate the human experience with profundity, facilitating self-transcendent emotions and a sense of existential belonging.

Nonetheless, dominant ethnospheres globally perpetuate anthropocentric detachment and objectification of the lands that birthed us. Indigenous cosmologies contrast starkly, considering humans as integralparticipants within territorially-defined ecosystems. Distinctions dissolve between natural and supernatural, facilitating sustainable human-land rapports wherein people provision themselves respectfully as ecosystems components. As SDG 15 recognizes, we have much to learn from these Earth-honoring wisdom traditions about cultivating harmonious and enduring relationships with nature.

The goal's targets encompass strategies to conserve biodiversity, combat ecosystem degradation, facilitate sustainable forest management, and ensure fair resource distribution among others. Yet undergirding these is a deeper existential recognition: that humanity neither transcends its terrestrial origins, nor holds dominion over a planet we merely inhabited temporarily. Rather, we remain ecological citizens interdependent with the biosphere's dynamical patterns and cyclical flows. With open humility, we must honor and participate gracefully within nature's Gaia-wisdom - rather than dissociating in hubris as external authorities over an alienated environment.

SDG 15 is thus a clarion call to reintegrate ourselves into the more-than-human Earth communities that issueus. Beyond the prudential reasons to conserve lands for human wellbeing lie moral imperatives to cultivate reverential Earth practices honoring nature's intrinsic validity. For it is only in reciprocal relationship with the biospheric matrix that birthed us that we source deepest belonging and existential meaning. The terrestrial life from which we emerged gifts wondrous teachings if we but attend with opened hearts to its perpetual evolutions. Perhaps then we may harmonize sustainably as cooperative participants in planetary nature's grand unfolding odyssey.
