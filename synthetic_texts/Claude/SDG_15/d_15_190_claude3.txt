Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 15 (Life on Land), written from the perspective of Ben Shapiro:

The concept of sustainable development has become a trendy buzzword among leftist policymakers and environmental alarmists. However, the 15th Sustainable Development Goal which aims to "protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems" merits sober analysis beyond the virtue signaling platitudes. While certainly a noble endeavor in theory, the practical implementation and economic ramifications must be scrutinized through a pragmatic, rational lens.  

The loss of biodiversity and degradation of forests, wetlands, and other vital ecosystems poses a tangible threat with far-reaching consequences. Species extinction destabilizes the delicately balanced food chain/web with rippling impacts on agriculture, disease vectors, and fundamentally altering habitats. Deforestation decimates natural carbon sinks, accelerating climate change - a phenomenon exacerbated by mankind's economic activity, regardless of the debate surrounding anthropogenic forcing mechanisms.  

That said, the solutions proffered by environmental radicals aiming to halt development in its tracks are utterly nonsensical. The romantic, Rousseauian idyll of "harmonizing" with unbridled nature is antithetical to human flourishing manifest through urbanization, technologically-driven productivity gains, and economic growth - the very forces which lifted billions out of abject poverty. This dogmatic anti-humanism championed by environmental extremists like Greenpeace, Sierra Club and their ilk must be quashed through empirical data and rational discourse.

A balanced, dispassionate cost-benefit analysis reveals that sustainable land management policies can be pragmatically implemented without undermining capitalism and individual liberty. Incentivizing private conservation efforts through substantive tax rebates, eco-tourism economic development, and sensible zoning laws can preserve habitats while fostering sustainable business investment. Furthermore, embracing technological innovations like genetic engineering, vertical farming, lab-grown meat and sustainable forestry management offsets human environmental encroachment. Recognizing rational self-interest, profit-driven corporations have powerful financial motivation to develop cutting-edge solutions protecting long-term ecological viability.

In summation, the philosophical underpinnings and specific policy prescriptions embedded within SDG 15 require meticulous scrutiny through objective pragmatism. Emotive, anti-capitalist sloganeering under the pretext of environmentalism cannot supersede reasoned economic principles and rational self-interest. A measured, empirically-grounded approach harnessing the power of free markets and individual liberties is vital for preserving terrestrial ecosystems in harmony with human socioeconomic development. Without such nuance, SDG 15 risks devolving into an ideological Trojan horse for economic stagnation and centralized government control under the guise of environmentalism.
