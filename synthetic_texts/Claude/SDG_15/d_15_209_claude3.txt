Here is a draft academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 15 (Life on Land), written from the perspective of economist Daron Acemoglu:

The degradation and unsustainable exploitation of terrestrial ecosystems poses a grave threat not just to biodiversity and ecological integrity, but to long-term economic development and societal prosperity. As an economist, I cannot overstate the importance of SDG 15 and its mandate to "protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss." This goal strikes at the heart of sustainable development by recognizing that economic activities are fundamentally reliant on natural capital and ecosystem services.

The institutional factors underpinning SDG 15 are a prime example of the pivotal roles that inclusive economic institutions and sound governance play in shaping development outcomes. Societies that have been able to structure incentives conducive to environmental stewardship through stable property rights, effective regulation, and inclusive decision-making processes have been far more successful in conserving land-based natural resources. Perverse economic incentives created by extractive institutions that privatize gains while socializing costs, or that systematically undervalue natural capital, catalyze the overexploitation of terrestrial ecosystems to disastrous ends.

We must recognize that land degradation, deforestation, desertification, and biodiversity loss are not unavoidable externalities, but rather direct consequences of institutional failures that enable actors to reap short-term private benefits while foisting the long-term social and economic costs onto the wider public. Secure communal land tenure has been demonstrated as a key institutional safeguard that protects indigenous lands and facilitates sustainable management practices attuned to local ecological constraints. Strong judicial and regulatory frameworks that hold extractive industries accountable and prevent environmental impunity are similarly imperative.

The impediments to achieving SDG 15 exemplify an institutional resource curse – the paradox whereby nations with an abundance of high-value natural resources frequently experience lower economic growth, exacerbated inequality, more corruption, and greater instability due to poor institutional quality. Just as the mismanagement of resource wealth has precipitated economic stagnation and conflict in many nations, so too does the destruction of terrestrial ecosystems – vital natural capital – portend immense future economic losses and instability. 

Indeed, climate change threatens to impose severe shocks on terrestrial ecosystems through increasing aridity, wildfires, land degradation, and biodiversity loss. This looming climate crisis highlights the truly existential risks of failing to safeguard life on land. A vicious cycle is catalyzed whereby terrestrial ecosystem collapse depletes natural carbon sinks, thereby exacerbating climate change, which in turn accelerates ecological destruction. Institutional resilience and the capacity for adaptation and sustainable resource governance will profoundly shape the ability of nations to navigate this crisis.

Holistic, inclusive policymaking is imperative to break the vicious cycles of environmental degradation and its socioeconomic ramifications. Incentive structures must be fundamentally restructured through innovative regulatory mechanisms, restructured property rights regimes, and an enlightened recalibration of economic priorities. Investments in sustainable land management practices, forest conservation, ecological restoration, and biodiversity preservation must be elevated from niceties to core strategies for long-term economic development.  

Existential risks emanate from the destruction of the ecological foundations upon which virtually all economic activity ultimately rests. SDG 15 articulates a transcendent challenge – to fundamentally reimagine the role of terrestrial ecosystems in economic development models. Its achievement hinges on the establishment of inclusive, resilient institutions and the alignment of incentives to reconcile sustainable natural resource management with human prosperity. Continued institutional inertia portends economic stagnation, intensifying resource conflicts, mass ecological disruption, and multi-generational human insecurity. The stakes could not be higher.
