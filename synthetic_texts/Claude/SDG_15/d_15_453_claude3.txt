WaterAid, a leading international non-profit organization dedicated to transforming lives by improving access to clean water, sanitation, and hygiene, presents a comprehensive analysis of the current state of Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG 15): "Life on Land." This report delves into the intricate web of challenges and opportunities that encompass the protection, restoration, and sustainable management of terrestrial ecosystems, forests, and biodiversity.

The urgency of addressing SDG 15 cannot be overstated, as the health of our planet's land-based resources is inextricably linked to the well-being of humanity and the sustainability of our global water systems. The degradation of terrestrial ecosystems not only threatens the rich tapestry of life on Earth but also jeopardizes the very foundations upon which our societies and economies are built.

In this report, we acknowledge the complex interplay between land degradation, water scarcity, and climate change. The delicate balance between these elements is highlighted by the fact that over 80% of the world's freshwater resources are used for agricultural and industrial purposes, putting immense pressure on land resources. Conversely, the degradation of forests, wetlands, and other natural habitats directly impacts the water cycle, exacerbating water scarcity and compromising the availability of clean water for human consumption and agricultural production.

Furthermore, we recognize the pivotal role that indigenous communities and local populations play in safeguarding and sustainably managing terrestrial ecosystems. Their traditional knowledge, practices, and cultural values have shaped landscapes for centuries, fostering biodiversity and promoting resilience. However, these communities often face marginalization, displacement, and lack of recognition of their land rights, hindering their ability to serve as stewards of the land.

WaterAid's analysis also explores the intricate nexus between land degradation, food insecurity, and water scarcity. As fertile land becomes increasingly scarce due to unsustainable agricultural practices, deforestation, and desertification, the ability to produce sufficient food for a growing global population is compromised. This, in turn, exacerbates water scarcity, as more water is required to compensate for declining crop yields, perpetuating a vicious cycle of resource depletion.

To address these multifaceted challenges, WaterAid advocates for a holistic and integrated approach that recognizes the interdependence of water, land, and biodiversity. We highlight the need for robust policies and governance frameworks that promote sustainable land management practices, such as agroforestry, conservation agriculture, and ecosystem-based adaptation strategies. These approaches not only protect and restore terrestrial ecosystems but also enhance water security and climate resilience.

Moreover, we emphasize the importance of inclusive and participatory decision-making processes that empower local communities, indigenous peoples, and marginalized groups. By recognizing and valuing their traditional knowledge and land rights, we can foster a sense of ownership and stewardship, ensuring the long-term sustainability of land and water resources.

WaterAid's analysis also underscores the critical role of innovative financing mechanisms and partnerships in achieving SDG 15. Public-private collaborations, impact investing, and blended finance models can catalyze the mobilization of resources for sustainable land management projects, while also promoting the transfer of knowledge and technology.

In conclusion, this report by WaterAid serves as a clarion call for urgent and concerted action to address the interconnected challenges of land degradation, water scarcity, and biodiversity loss. By embracing a holistic and integrated approach, recognizing the rights and knowledge of local communities, and fostering innovative partnerships, we can pave the way for a future where terrestrial ecosystems thrive, water resources are secure, and the delicate balance between humanity and nature is restored.
