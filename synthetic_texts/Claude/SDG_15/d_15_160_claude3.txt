Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 15 (Life on Land) as if written by Jonah Goldberg:

The Paradox of Sustainable Conservation: How Environmental Extremism Undermines Its Own Aims

When the United Nations launched its grandiose agenda of 17 Sustainable Development Goals in 2015, the noble rhetoric soared to Olympian heights. In the words of former Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, the SDGs represented nothing less than "a plan of action for people, planet and prosperity." Among the loftier goals was SDG 15: a sweeping call to action to "protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."

In the name of this lush green utopia, a new ascendant eco-theocracy has arisen, one which preaches a fundamentalist dogma of "rewilding" and restricting humanity's footprint through draconian measures. Like the Shakers who died out because they abjured procreation, this new environmentalist orthodoxy seems bound to self-defeat through its increasingly extreme tactics and flawed assumptions.

At its heart, the ideology underpinning SDG 15 suffers from a contradiction that fatally undermines its goals from within. While purporting to safeguard life on land, its true priority - one could say obsession - is eliminating mankind's presence and rolefrom the natural world entirely. The overriding ambition is not sustainable conservation but a reversion to a pristine, human-free environment, a mythical Eden untainted by the dirty fingerprints of civilization.

This quasi-religious vision manifests itself in foolhardy, headline-grabbing initiatives like reintroducing wolves, bears and other large predators to regions they were extirpated from long ago for good reason. Predictably, this has led to fatal conflicts with ordinary people trying to make an honest living, as well as surges in livestock killings and ecological havoc from overpopulated predators with no natural controls. Likewise, the restrictive land-use policies and demonization of activitiessuch as grazing, timbering, mining, hunting and rural development have only impoverished and embittered the very communities most directly impacted, fueling backlash against the entire SDG enterprise.

Perhaps the most glaring exemplar of this purist mentality run amok is the incessant demonization of anthropogenic climate change as an "existential threat" to all life on Earth that only radical solutions like abolishing fossil fuels and de-industrialization can solve. This phantasmagorical fear-mongering willfully ignores reams of data demonstrating that moderate climate changes have occurred innumerable times throughout planetary history due to perfectly natural fluctuations, with most species proving significantly more adaptable than the environmentalist clergy admits.

Indeed, the very concept that life on land was some pristine, idyllic equilibrium until the human "virus" disrupted its perfect stasis is anhistorical nonsense. The planet's ecosystems and geology have been in continual flux for billions of years, with mass extinction events, temperature swings, atmospheric changes and ecological reshufflings playing out in an endless cycle of upheaval and renewal. The more static and inflexible we attempt to render the natural world through excessive human intervention and control, the more we hamper its intrinsic dynamism and resilience. For life to not merely survive but thrive on land requires a tolerant flexibility that extremist environmental policies actively undermine.

In a bitter irony, the very societies and economic systems that the eco-radicals excoriate as capitalist ecogeddon are the same ones that pioneered preservationist policies, pollution controls, land management and wildlife conservation methods. Developing nations untouched by such "ravages of industrialization" tend to be the ones with harrowing rates of unchecked deforestation, poaching of endangered species and "slash and burn" ecological plunder. By branding Western, market-based societies as irredeemable despoilers while pitting the entire human species against the natural world as antagonists, environmental fundamentalists ensure a tragic no-win scenario where nobody and nothing wins.

A wiser, more holistic path to achieving SDG 15 involves accepting certain ecological realities. Humanity is not a malignant virus detached from nature, but an integral component of the same biosphere we ostensibly seek to steward. Striking a harmonious balance wherein people can thrive andecosystems can sustainably endure is a more judicious ambition than attempting to re-engineer the planet as a theme park wilderness with mankind sealed away behind velvet ropes.

Land policies aimed at productive wildlife corridors, regulated mixed-use spaces and collaborative efforts with indigenous peoples and other stakeholders have shown far greater promise than reactionary restrictions. Technological innovations in sustainable energy like nuclear fusion and green ammonia represent wiser
