The Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG 15), which aims to protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainable management of forests, combating desertification, and halting and reversing land degradation and biodiversity loss, is a critical objective that demands immediate and sustained action. The Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation ACP-EU (CTA) recognizes the profound implications of this goal for global food security, ecological stability, and the well-being of rural communities.

Terrestrial ecosystems, encompassing forests, savannas, grasslands, and deserts, play a vital role in sustaining life on Earth. They serve as habitats for countless species, regulate climate patterns, and provide essential resources for human populations. However, these ecosystems are under severe threat from a multitude of anthropogenic pressures, including deforestation, unsustainable agricultural practices, urbanization, and climate change.

Deforestation, driven by the expansion of agricultural lands, logging, and infrastructure development, continues to be a major concern globally. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the world has lost approximately 420 million hectares of forest since 1990, an area larger than the entire European Union. This alarming rate of forest loss not only threatens biodiversity but also exacerbates climate change by reducing the planet's capacity to absorb and store carbon dioxide. Moreover, deforestation disrupts the delicate balance of ecosystems, leading to soil erosion, water scarcity, and the displacement of indigenous communities.

Unsustainable agricultural practices, such as monoculture, excessive use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, and overgrazing, contribute significantly to land degradation and biodiversity loss. These practices deplete soil fertility, contaminate water sources, and disrupt the intricate web of life that sustains healthy ecosystems. In many regions, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia, the combined effects of these practices and climate change have exacerbated desertification, rendering once-fertile lands unproductive and threatening the livelihoods of smallholder farmers.

Climate change, driven by greenhouse gas emissions from human activities, is a cross-cutting threat that amplifies the challenges faced by terrestrial ecosystems. Rising temperatures, shifting precipitation patterns, and increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods, are already altering the distribution and abundance of species, disrupting ecological processes, and rendering entire habitats uninhabitable.

The CTA recognizes the urgency of addressing these interrelated challenges and has developed a comprehensive strategy to support the achievement of SDG 15. This strategy encompasses several key components:

1. Promoting sustainable land management practices: The CTA advocates for the adoption of agroecological approaches that prioritize soil health, water conservation, and biodiversity. These include techniques such as conservation agriculture, agroforestry, and integrated pest management, which mimic natural processes and enhance ecosystem resilience.

2. Strengthening community-based natural resource management: The CTA emphasizes the importance of empowering local communities to sustainably manage their natural resources. This involves supporting community-based forest management initiatives, fostering participatory land-use planning, and facilitating knowledge exchange among indigenous and traditional communities.

3. Enhancing climate change adaptation and mitigation: The CTA recognizes the need to build the capacity of rural communities to adapt to the impacts of climate change. This includes promoting climate-smart agriculture practices, supporting ecosystem-based adaptation strategies, and facilitating access to climate finance mechanisms.

4. Fostering regional and international cooperation: Addressing the challenges of SDG 15 requires concerted efforts at regional and global levels. The CTA supports the development of regional strategies for sustainable land management, facilitates knowledge sharing among ACP countries, and contributes to international dialogues on biodiversity conservation and land degradation neutrality.

5. Strengthening policy and institutional frameworks: The CTA advocates for the development and implementation of policies that promote sustainable land use, forest conservation, and the protection of biodiversity. This involves supporting the development of national and regional strategies, providing technical assistance to policymakers, and fostering multi-stakeholder dialogues.

The CTA's approach to achieving SDG 15 is grounded in the principles of inclusivity, context-specific solutions, and the recognition of the interconnectedness of human well-being and ecosystem health. By fostering collaborative efforts among governments, civil society organizations, private sector actors, and local communities, the CTA aims to catalyze transformative change that safeguards terrestrial ecosystems and ensures sustainable livelihoods for present and future generations.

In conclusion, the challenges posed by SDG 15 are formidable, but not insurmountable. Through a concerted and holistic approach that addresses the root causes of ecosystem degradation, promotes sustainable land management practices, and empowers local communities, the CTA is committed to preserving the invaluable natural heritage of ACP countries and contributing to the global effort to protect, restore, and promote the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems.
