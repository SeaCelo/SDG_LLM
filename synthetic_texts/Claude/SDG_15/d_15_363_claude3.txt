As a multilateral development bank with a mission to foster sustainable growth in its regions of operation, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has been actively engaged in promoting Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG 15), which aims to "protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."

The EBRD recognizes the intrinsic value of Earth's terrestrial ecosystems and the vital services they provide, from maintaining soil fertility and regulating the water cycle to mitigating climate change and supporting biodiversity. However, these ecosystems are under unprecedented pressure from human activities, including unsustainable agricultural practices, urbanization, resource extraction, and pollution.

In response, the EBRD has adopted a comprehensive approach to address SDG 15, spanning policy dialogue, technical assistance, and investment operations across its regions of operation. The Bank's efforts are guided by its Environmental and Social Policy, which mandates the integration of environmental and social considerations into all its investment decisions.

One of the EBRD's key focus areas is promoting sustainable land management practices, particularly in regions prone to desertification and land degradation. The Bank has supported projects that enhance soil conservation, introduce drought-resistant crops, and promote sustainable irrigation techniques. For instance, in Central Asia, the EBRD has financed projects that have introduced water-saving technologies and improved irrigation infrastructure, resulting in increased agricultural productivity while reducing water consumption and soil erosion.

The EBRD has also been a driving force in promoting sustainable forestry practices and combating illegal logging. In the Western Balkans, the Bank has provided technical assistance and financing to strengthen forest governance, improve monitoring systems, and support the development of value-added wood processing industries. These efforts have not only contributed to the preservation of forest ecosystems but have also created economic opportunities for local communities.

Biodiversity conservation is another critical area of the EBRD's work under SDG 15. The Bank has supported the establishment and expansion of protected areas, as well as the development of sustainable tourism initiatives that generate revenue for conservation efforts. In Turkey, for instance, the EBRD has financed projects that have helped to establish and manage protected areas, while also promoting eco-tourism and creating employment opportunities for local communities.

The EBRD recognizes that achieving SDG 15 requires a collaborative effort involving governments, private sector entities, and civil society organizations. As such, the Bank has actively engaged in policy dialogue and knowledge-sharing initiatives to promote best practices and facilitate the adoption of sustainable land management strategies. The Bank has also leveraged its investments to encourage private sector clients to adopt environmentally and socially responsible practices, including through the use of performance-based incentives.

Furthermore, the EBRD has been at the forefront of developing innovative financing mechanisms to support SDG 15. For example, the Bank has piloted green finance instruments, such as green bonds and sustainability-linked loans, to mobilize private capital for projects that contribute to environmental sustainability, including those related to land use and biodiversity conservation.

While significant progress has been made, the EBRD acknowledges that challenges remain in achieving SDG 15. Climate change, population growth, and increasing resource demands continue to exert pressure on terrestrial ecosystems. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the interconnectedness between human health, ecosystem integrity, and economic development, underscoring the need for a holistic approach to sustainable development.

Moving forward, the EBRD remains committed to working with its partners to address these challenges and accelerate progress towards SDG 15. The Bank recognizes the need for continued innovation, knowledge-sharing, and capacity-building to promote sustainable land management practices and biodiversity conservation. Additionally, the EBRD will continue to leverage its financing and policy dialogue efforts to catalyze systemic change and mobilize resources for sustainable development.
