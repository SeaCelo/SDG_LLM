The Italian Development Cooperation Programme has long been a staunch advocate of sustainable development, with a particular emphasis on the preservation and responsible management of terrestrial ecosystems. In recent years, our efforts have been guided by the overarching framework of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG 15), which aims to "protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and biodiversity loss."

Our approach to achieving SDG 15 has been multifaceted, involving a combination of policy initiatives, international partnerships, and on-the-ground interventions. At the core of our strategy lies the recognition that terrestrial ecosystems are not only vital for sustaining life on our planet but also inextricably linked to human well-being, economic prosperity, and social stability.

One of our key focus areas has been the conservation and sustainable management of forests, which play a crucial role in mitigating climate change, preserving biodiversity, and supporting the livelihoods of millions of people worldwide. Through bilateral agreements and multilateral initiatives, we have worked closely with partner countries to strengthen forest governance, combat illegal logging, and promote sustainable forest management practices. Our efforts have included providing technical assistance, capacity building, and financial support for reforestation and afforestation projects, as well as initiatives aimed at enhancing the participation of local communities in forest management.

In parallel, we have prioritized the fight against desertification and land degradation, recognizing the severe consequences these phenomena have on food security, water availability, and economic stability in affected regions. Our interventions have ranged from supporting sustainable land management practices, such as agroforestry and conservation agriculture, to promoting climate-smart technologies and facilitating knowledge transfer among stakeholders. Additionally, we have actively participated in international forums and initiatives aimed at enhancing cooperation and knowledge-sharing in combating desertification and land degradation, particularly in vulnerable regions like the Sahel and the Horn of Africa.

Biodiversity conservation has been another central pillar of our efforts under SDG 15. We have collaborated with international organizations, non-governmental organizations, and local partners to establish and manage protected areas, safeguard critical habitats, and develop strategies for the sustainable use of natural resources. Our initiatives have encompassed a wide range of activities, from supporting community-based conservation efforts and promoting sustainable tourism to facilitating research and monitoring programs to better understand and mitigate threats to biodiversity.

Furthermore, we have recognized the inextricable link between terrestrial ecosystems and sustainable development in sectors such as agriculture, energy, and water management. As a result, we have advocated for an integrated approach that considers the interdependencies between these sectors and the natural environment. Our efforts have included promoting sustainable agricultural practices, supporting the transition to renewable energy sources, and facilitating the adoption of water-efficient technologies and practices.

It is important to note that our work under SDG 15 has not been limited to international cooperation alone. We have also taken decisive steps to align our domestic policies and practices with the principles of sustainable development and environmental conservation. This has involved reforming existing laws and regulations, implementing incentive programs, and fostering partnerships with civil society organizations, the private sector, and academic institutions.

Looking ahead, we recognize that achieving SDG 15 requires sustained and collective efforts from all stakeholders. As such, we remain committed to strengthening international cooperation, fostering knowledge-sharing, and mobilizing resources to support the implementation of effective and sustainable solutions. We will continue to prioritize the integration of environmental considerations into development strategies, while also promoting inclusive and participatory approaches that empower local communities and recognize their traditional knowledge and practices.

Ultimately, our efforts under SDG 15 are guided by the realization that the fate of terrestrial ecosystems is inextricably linked to our collective well-being and the long-term sustainability of our planet. By working together with partners across the globe, we aim to create a future where thriving ecosystems coexist harmoniously with human development, ensuring a healthy and prosperous world for generations to come.
