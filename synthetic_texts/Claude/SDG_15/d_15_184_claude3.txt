Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 15 (Life on Land) from the perspective of Dennis Prager:

The importance of preserving life on land cannot be overstated. As human beings, we have a sacred responsibility as stewards of God's creation to respect and protect the natural world He has entrusted to us. This extends not just to ourselves, but to all living creatures with whom we share this planet - from the smallest microorganisms to the mighty forestry that graces landscapes across the globe.  

When we examine the 15th Sustainable Development Goal set forth by the United Nations, which aims to "protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss," we must recognize that this is not merely an environmental or economic imperative. It is a moral and ethical calling rooted in reverence for the divinely created natural order.

Those who deride efforts to conserve habitats, prevent species extinction, and halt the relentless exploitation of land fail to grasp the gravity of our situation. We are not just jeopardizing the robustness of ecological systems upon which all life depends. We are defying the purpose for which we were placed on this earth as guardians and caretakers. To disregard our duties is to spit in the face of the Almighty and bring ruination upon ourselves through our own hubris.

Consider the woeful state of the world's forests, which play an outsize role in sustaining biological diversity while providing food, fuel, and shelter for billions worldwide. Each year, we permanent lose an area of forested land larger than the nation of Portugal. This rapacious demolition has already claimed nearly half of all forests that once adorned the earth. What's more, the rate of deforestation is accelerating dramatically, with recent annual losses giving away 7 million hectares each year. At this pace, science tells us that the world's remaining forests could be gone within the next century.

This is nothing short of ecocide - a crime of such grotesque indecency as to defy comprehension from any sane, moral human being. It represents a full-scale assault on the ecological harmony crafted through eons of creation by our Maker's hand. To permit such ruination is to enable a genocide of nonhuman life unparalleled in the history of our planet.  

We dare not perpetuate the arrogant myth that humanity can exist apart from the natural world, as if we were self-contained beings able to manufacture the regenerative systems upon which our very existence relies. It is the height of hubris and ingratitude to ravage the earthly abundance provided by God while foolishly presuming we can mock His created order with impunity.

Every living organism, be it flora or fauna, serves a purpose in the delicate tapestry of our biosphere. Each species extinguished, each habitat demolished, each acre of land degraded—it all inures to our cumulative detriment by upsetting the critical ecological balances and regenerative cycles that undergird all life. To sacrifice the natural world is to ultimately cannibalize ourselves by destroying the foundations that nourish humankind.

We have become enmeshed in a culture of ingratitude and entitlement, exhibiting the capacity for unprecedented self-destruction. But we must not despair. By reawakening our reverence for God's creation and realigning our behavior with His wisdom, we can honor our role as benevolent stewards entrusted with paradise on earth.

Meeting Sustainable Development Goal 15 is a profound moral calling incumbent upon every human soul. To those who profess belief in a higher power, defending the natural world from humanity's wasteful impulses becomes a sacred charge of the highest order. We cannot stand idly as entire bioregions collapse into desolation. We must act to preserve and restore terrestrial ecosystems as an affirmation of our gratitude for the divinely-ordained bounties that sustain us.

The path forward demands nothing less than a renaissance of virtue rediscovering the eternal wisdom of living in balance with the natural world—not as pillagers and usurpers, but as humble guardians safeguarding God's creation for future generations. This is the heart of Sustainable Development Goal 15 and the only righteous way to proceed as moral stewards of our planetary home. Humanity must pursue environmental redemption through adherence to spiritual values and awe before the majesty of creation. In so doing, we reaffirm the purpose of our earthly journey and renew our covenant with the Author of the natural world.
