Here is a long academic article draft about Sustainable Development Goal 15 (Life on Land), written from the perspective of Nicholas Kristof:

The Inconvenient Truth About Our Forests

By Nicholas Kristof

Amid the understandable global focus on climate change, one angle has been neglected: the rapid destruction of the world's forests and its consequences for biodiversity, indigenous populations, and indeed the health of the planet itself.

Unsustainable deforestation is defying international efforts and accelerating at an alarming pace due to corporate greed, poor governance, and misguided policies. If we don't wake up to this catastrophe unfolding before our eyes, we will impoverish the kaleidoscope of life on earth and betray one of the founding aims of the Sustainable Development Goals.

Goal 15 of the SDGs aims to "Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss." Good luck with that.

The hard numbers are sickening. More than half of the world's rainforests have already been razed. At the current rate, the Amazon Basin – one of the world's green lungs – will be stripped bare within a generation. Globally, 32 million acres of forests are destroyed each year, an area larger than Greece.

I've seen this wanton pillaging firsthand in Indonesia, where prehistoric forests are being incinerated to create palm oil plantations – a preposterous trade of biodiversity for Doritos and lipstick. On the island of Sumatra, I stepped jaw-agape through fantastical tropical jungles bursting with ferns, orchids and titanic trees smothered in vines. Around the next bend, an infernal scene of scorched earth and apocalyptic smoke stretching endlessly. Nearby villages were engulfed in a toxic smog that sent children with hacking coughs to ill-equipped clinics.

All this for a vegetable oil that could easily be replaced by other crops. What an obscene price to pay.

In Brazil, cattle barons have burnt and bulldozed an area larger than Syria to create pastures in the Amazon. Entire tribes of indigenous peoples are being displaced and exposed to disease, violence and cultural extinction in this quest for the almighty burger. The Yanomami territory in northern Brazil has already suffered a 30% loss of its forests, despite its constitutional protections.

If you visit the Amazon, you'll see the mentality up close. Locals make references to "ovos de ouro" (golden eggs) and speak about the forests solely in terms of their economic value – as potential cattle ranches, soy farms or timber mines. To them, the rainforest is an obstacle rather than the fantastical and fragile organism it is.

President Bolsonaro's policies are little more than a flame-thrower aimed at the forests. He has eviscerated environmental agencies and turned a blind eye to illegal land grabbing. A record 3,500 square miles of the Amazon were lost in the first half of 2022.

Meanwhile, across the scorched savannahs of eastern and southern Africa, growing populations collidewith elephants, lions, and other iconic megafauna in an escalating struggle for space and resources. Poachers have decimated rhino and elephant populations for their horns and tusks, slaughtering them by the tens of thousands annually. Trophy hunters bribe corrupt officials to enable sick and twisted hunts of endangered species.

But numbers can obscure as much as they reveal. 32 million acres of forest does not convey the crippling impact on biodiverse ecosystems that have evolved symbiotically over eons. Each great forest is a masterpiece of nature, and their loss is an intellectual and philosophical dimming of humanity itself.

The Amazon rainforest alone contains one-fifth of all bird species on earth, one-fifth of all freshwater fish, and one-third of all vascular plant species. Each acre conceals more undiscovered species than science has yet catalogued. When we burn it, we're incinerating libraries of ancient wisdom and torching keys that could advance human knowledge or pave the way to new medicines or crops.

We are the impoverished ones, for losing the transcendent treasures of a living, breathing forest. What pathetic self-inflicted soullessness this is. The great forests humble us with their majesty and mystery, cloaking us with their timelessness. They are the grandest of all cathedrals, and we their poor, deluded arsonists.

We already know how this ends. Conservationists estimate that 1 million species are at risk of extinction – many within decades. Genetic resources that nourished our ancestors and might sustain our children will be forever lost. Traditional communities sustained by the forests will descend into desperation and displacement. And Earth's great biological engines that create the soil, cycle water, pollinate crops and trees, and moderated the climate will wind down into oblivion.

And for what? Deforestation causes annual global losses of up to $7 trillion annuallythrough reduced rainfall, soil erosion, poorer crop yields, and destroyed eco-tourism and biodiversity revenues. By one calculation, preserving the Amazon rainforest is worth $8.2 billion per year just for its atmospheric regulation impacts. That's before we consider the lost pharmaceutical potential, the indigenous cultures eradicated, and the ineffable aesthetic inheritance plundered.

Today's ruthless deforestation is worse than mere folly. It is a morally bankrupt betrayal of our very humanity. And it happens because the voiceless poor who depend on the forests lack the power, and the wealthy who could stop the carnage lack the wisdom or foresight.

I would not be so discouraged except that we know what can be done. In Bhutan, the sustainable management of forests is literally written into that country's constitution. In Costa Rica, payments to landowners not to cut down forests has dramatically reduced deforestation. In Brazil, deforestation declined by 80% over the past two decades thanks to satellite monitoring, better law enforcement and pressure from conscientious corporations and consumers.

We know the solutions – we simply lack the leadership and fortitude to implement them. Tropical forests don't just need designated parks, but entire corridors of connected protected areas. Sensible economic models like "debt-for-nature" swaps can halt rainforest destruction. We must address the fundamental drivers, from unchecked corruption to indigenous land rights to low political prioritization for forests.

There is still time – perhaps a decade – to reverse our catastrophic forest losses and embrace a wiser path of preservation and sustainability before it's truly too late. We owe this not only to the forests themselves, and to all their wonderful creatures who lack a voice, but to our own humanity that withers when we carelessly let the natural world's magnificence slip away.

In this battle for the forests, it is we humans who will ultimately be preserved, or go into tragic extinction of the spirit and soul.
