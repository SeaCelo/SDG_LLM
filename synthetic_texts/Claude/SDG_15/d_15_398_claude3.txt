Sustainable Development Goal 15, "Life on Land," addresses the urgent need to protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, and halt biodiversity loss. As a leading Methodist relief and development organization, All We Can recognizes the critical importance of this goal in safeguarding the planet's vital natural resources and ensuring the well-being of communities dependent on them.

The challenges posed by land degradation, deforestation, and biodiversity loss are intrinsically linked to poverty, food insecurity, and climate change â€“ issues that lie at the heart of our mission. Across the globe, vulnerable communities bear the brunt of these environmental crises, with their livelihoods and resilience hanging in a delicate balance.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, where we have a significant presence, the impacts of desertification and land degradation are particularly severe. Vast swaths of once-arable land have been rendered unproductive, exacerbating food insecurity and forcing communities to adopt unsustainable coping mechanisms, such as overexploitation of remaining resources. The loss of vital ecosystem services, including water regulation, soil fertility, and climate regulation, perpetuates a vicious cycle of poverty and environmental degradation.

Our on-the-ground efforts in these regions have highlighted the intricate relationship between sustainable land management practices and community resilience. Through partnerships with local organizations and communities, we have implemented initiatives that promote agroforestry, soil conservation, and sustainable agriculture techniques. These interventions not only restore degraded landscapes but also enhance food security, diversify income streams, and mitigate the impacts of climate change.

In regions like the Amazon Basin, where we collaborate with indigenous communities, the threat of deforestation looms large. The rapid loss of these critical carbon sinks and biodiversity hotspots not only jeopardizes local livelihoods but also contributes significantly to global climate change. Our approach involves supporting community-led conservation efforts, promoting sustainable forest management practices, and advocating for the recognition of indigenous land rights.

Furthermore, we recognize the interconnectedness of terrestrial ecosystems with other SDGs, such as clean water (SDG 6), climate action (SDG 13), and responsible consumption and production (SDG 12). By addressing land degradation and deforestation, we not only contribute to SDG 15 but also create positive ripple effects across multiple development goals.

However, our efforts extend beyond direct interventions. We actively engage in advocacy and policy dialogue, leveraging our expertise and on-the-ground experience to shape global discourse on sustainable land management. Our partnerships with international organizations, governments, and civil society groups amplify our impact and promote the adoption of holistic, integrated approaches to addressing land degradation and biodiversity loss.

Through a combination of grassroots action, capacity-building initiatives, and policy advocacy, we strive to empower communities, foster sustainable land stewardship, and catalyze systemic change. Our commitment to SDG 15 is unwavering, as we recognize the profound implications of terrestrial ecosystem degradation on the well-being of both people and the planet.
