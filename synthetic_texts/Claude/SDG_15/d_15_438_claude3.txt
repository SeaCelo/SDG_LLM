Plan International presents this in-depth analysis on the progress, challenges, and future outlook for Sustainable Development Goal 15 â€“ Life on Land. SDG 15 aims to protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, and halt biodiversity loss.

Despite concerted global efforts, the world is alarmingly off-track in achieving SDG 15 by 2030. The unprecedented rate of biodiversity loss, driven by human activities such as deforestation, unsustainable agriculture, urbanization, and climate change, poses an existential threat to life on Earth. Approximately 1 million animal and plant species are currently at risk of extinction, many within decades. This rapid decline in biodiversity undermines nature's ability to provide vital ecosystem services, jeopardizing food security, water supply, and disease regulation.

Deforestation remains a critical issue, with the world's forest area diminishing by 3.9 million hectares annually between 2010 and 2020. The Amazon rainforest, often referred to as the "lungs of the planet," has experienced an alarming surge in deforestation rates, primarily driven by illegal logging, mining, and agricultural expansion. The loss of these carbon sinks exacerbates climate change, which in turn intensifies the risk of wildfires, pests, and diseases, creating a vicious cycle of forest degradation.

Land degradation, primarily caused by unsustainable agricultural practices, urbanization, and extractive industries, affects over 20% of the Earth's land area and continues to worsen. Desertification, the process by which fertile land becomes desert, threatens the livelihoods of millions, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa and Central Asia. Soil erosion, nutrient depletion, and salinization further diminish agricultural productivity, intensifying food insecurity and contributing to rural poverty and forced migration.

The illegal wildlife trade, valued at an estimated $23 billion annually, has led to the precipitous decline of iconic species such as elephants, rhinos, and pangolins. This lucrative illicit industry not only threatens biodiversity but also undermines national security, fuels corruption, and deprives local communities of valuable eco-tourism revenue.

Despite these daunting challenges, there are glimmers of hope. Innovative approaches like community-based natural resource management, payments for ecosystem services, and sustainable intensification of agriculture have shown promising results in preserving biodiversity while improving livelihoods. Indigenous communities, who have historically been custodians of biodiversity, are increasingly recognized for their invaluable knowledge and cultural practices that promote sustainable land management.

However, achieving SDG 15 requires a transformative shift in our relationship with nature. Governments must prioritize sustainable land-use policies, strengthen environmental regulations, and invest in ecosystem restoration initiatives. The private sector must embrace circularity, sustainable supply chains, and nature-based solutions. Civil society organizations must amplify the voices of local communities and advocate for environmental justice.

Ultimately, the success of SDG 15 hinges on our collective ability to recognize the intrinsic value of biodiversity and ecosystems, not just as resources to be exploited, but as the foundation upon which human civilization rests. By embracing a paradigm shift towards sustainable and equitable stewardship of our planet's terrestrial ecosystems, we can chart a path toward a greener, more resilient, and more prosperous future for all.
