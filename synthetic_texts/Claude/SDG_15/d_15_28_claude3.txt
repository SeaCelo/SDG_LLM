The global commitment to "Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss" has yielded uneven progress across the least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs). These nations face unique challenges that hinder their ability to safeguard life on land effectively.

Across the LDCs, rapid population growth, poverty, and a reliance on subsistence agriculture exert immense pressure on terrestrial ecosystems. Deforestation rates remain alarmingly high, driven by the expansion of agricultural land, illegal logging, and the demand for fuelwood and charcoal. This not only threatens biodiversity hotspots but also increases the vulnerability of communities to the impacts of climate change, such as droughts, floods, and soil erosion.

The situation is particularly dire in the Sahel region of Africa, where desertification and land degradation have severely impacted food security and livelihoods. Overgrazing, unsustainable agricultural practices, and the overexploitation of natural resources have led to the loss of fertile land and the deterioration of ecosystems. Efforts to combat desertification have been hampered by limited financial resources, inadequate policy frameworks, and a lack of coordination among stakeholders.

In the SIDS, the fragile terrestrial ecosystems are under immense pressure from coastal development, tourism, invasive species, and the impacts of climate change. Sea-level rise and extreme weather events pose existential threats to these island nations, endangering their unique biodiversity and the livelihoods of communities that depend on them.

The Maldives, for instance, has seen a significant decline in its coral reef ecosystems due to ocean acidification and rising sea temperatures. This has far-reaching consequences for the island's marine life and the economic sectors that rely on them, such as tourism and fisheries. Efforts to preserve and restore these ecosystems have been hindered by limited resources and capacity.

LLDCs face their own set of challenges when it comes to sustainable land management. Lack of access to the sea and high transportation costs have made it difficult for these countries to diversify their economies, leading to an overreliance on natural resource extraction, such as mining and logging.

In Mongolia, overgrazing and unsustainable mining practices have led to widespread land degradation, desertification, and the loss of biodiversity. The country's nomadic herders, who rely on healthy grasslands for their livelihoods, have been particularly affected by these changes.

Efforts to address these challenges have been hampered by a lack of financial resources, technical expertise, and effective governance frameworks. Many LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs struggle to enforce environmental regulations and incentivize sustainable land management practices due to competing development priorities and limited institutional capacity.

Despite these challenges, there are pockets of progress and innovation that offer hope for a more sustainable future. Community-based natural resource management initiatives have proven effective in empowering local communities to protect and sustainably manage their natural resources. In Nepal, for example, community forestry programs have led to a remarkable recovery of forest cover and biodiversity.

Similarly, in the Comoros Islands, a SIDS in the Indian Ocean, the establishment of locally managed marine areas has helped to conserve and restore coral reefs, replenishing fish stocks and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the islands' marine resources.

Innovative financing mechanisms, such as debt-for-nature swaps and impact investment funds, have also shown promise in mobilizing resources for conservation efforts in these vulnerable nations.

However, more needs to be done to address the systemic challenges faced by LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs. Increased international support, capacity building, and technology transfer are crucial for enabling these countries to develop and implement effective policies and strategies for sustainable land management.

Moreover, there is a need for greater recognition of the unique vulnerabilities and challenges faced by these nations within the global sustainable development agenda. Tailored approaches that take into account their specific contexts and prioritize resilience-building are essential for ensuring that no country is left behind in the pursuit of SDG 15.
