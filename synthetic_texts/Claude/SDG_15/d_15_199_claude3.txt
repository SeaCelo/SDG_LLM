Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 15 (Life on Land), written from the perspective of the late economist Walter E. Williams:

The Tragedy of the Environmental Commons

By Walter E. Williams

One of the most serious threats to biodiversity and sustainable ecosystems is the economic phenomenon known as the tragedy of the commons. First described by the ecologist Garrett Hardin in his seminal 1968 essay, it refers to the degradation and overexploitation of a shared resource when individual users act in their own self-interest and have no incentive for restraint.

The quintessential example is the overgrazed pasture, where every herdsman seeks to maximize their livestock on the commons, ultimately leading to the destruction of the very land resource upon which they all depend. But the tragedy plays out in many environmental arenas—overfishing, deforestation, pollution of air and waterways. Each party rationally pursues their individual interests, but the collective result is the ruination of the very resource at stake.

The economic analysis is clear—a lack of clearly delineated and enforced property rights leads to this "free rider" problem. Resources with no ownership become prone to overuse and neglect. But potential solutions are far more complex when the "commons" is global and ownership is shared across nations and cultures. Protecting biodiversity and promoting sustainable management of terrestrial ecosystems is one of the great challenges facing humanity.

The UN's Sustainable Development Goal 15 calls for action to "Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss." A noble aspiration to be sure. But the economic reality is one of conflicting incentives and a global tragedy of the commons playing out on a massive scale.  

Developing nations understandably seek to exploit natural resources as a pathway out of poverty. Why should they leave rainforests intact or limit logging, mining, and industrialization when developed nations exploited their own environments for centuries to achieve prosperity? But those very developed nations, now economically capable of conservation efforts, face political obstacles due to the self-interests of industries, lobbying groups, and constituencies hostile to environmental regulations.

Meanwhile, supposedly "sustainable" industries like agriculture critically depend on practices that deplete soil, consume fossil fuel-derived fertilizers, and promote monocultures that endanger biodiversity. Cheap imports from overseas undermine attempts at sustainability. The global commodity markets create distorted incentives disconnected from environmental impacts. It's a Gordian knot of misaligned incentives sprawled across a so-called "global commons."

The voluntary approach relied upon by the UN has proved grossly inadequate. While some nations make notable strides, others freeride, their citizens reaping the environmental benefits while still degrading the planet's precious resources. We are witnessing a repeating tragedy of the commons on a scale that could leave future generations on a barren, despoiled Earth.

Some harsh realities must be confronted. National sovereignty over environmental policies is the obstacle to real progress. If saving the Earth's terrestrial ecosystems is truly a global imperative, then an international property rights construct with enforceable policies and punitive costs on violators is ultimately required. A single nation's isolationism or another's refusal to sacrifice economic development must not be allowed to undermine the whole.

It may already be too late to fully reverse some ecological damage. But the only economically coherent path toward "protecting, restoring and promoting" the sustainable use of the Earth's lands is by establishing a unified environmental property rights regime with credible global authority and accountability. Otherwise, the individual incentives of nations and interest groups will continue pillaging the environmental commons to its eventual ruin.

This may sound like an extremist proposal, but extremism in the defense of environmental sustainability is no vice. Mustering the international cooperation to achieve some binding global authority may seem politically impossible. But the economic forces behind humanity's current collision course are equally implacable. Something must give, because endless environmental tragedies are the alternative.

As Nobel Laureate Elinor Ostrom articulated, the solutions are not purely state control nor pure privatization—regulated public-private systems of governance can protect shared environmental resources, but only with robust community engagement. Applied globally, that means the world's people taking true ownership of the environmental commons through unified policies designed to align incentives for genuine sustainability.

Economists bemoan the "free rider" problem, but there are no free riders when it comes to the environment we all share. We are all invested in the same environmental future, like it or not. The sooner humanity transcends petty national boundaries and special interests, the sooner we can confront the economic reality—restore environmental property rights on a planetary scale, or witness the ultimate Tragedy of our Environmental Commons.
