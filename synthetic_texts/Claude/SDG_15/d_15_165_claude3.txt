Here is a long academic article on SDG 15 (Life on Land) written from the perspective of satirical novelist Carl Hiaasen:

Florida's Natural Treasures Are Going, Going, Gone

Listen up, folks. I'm here to lay it out straight about what's happening to our precious slice of paradise down here in the flat lands of Florida. We're letting a bunch of greedy developers, corrupt politicians, and brain-dead residents pave over the last remnants of our once-glorious wilderness areas. The tortoises, panthers, bobcats and black bears are all getting squeezed out to make way for more soulless suburbia. It's an environmental massacre, I tell you.

The Sustainable Development Goal of protecting "Life on Land" (SDG 15) is being completely ignored in the Sunshine State. We're supposed to be sustainably managing our forests, combating desertification, halting biodiversity loss, and stopping the poaching and trafficking of protected species. But nobody down here seems to give a rat's behind. 

Take a gander at what's happening to our dwindling wetlands down in the Everglades. The Army Corps of Engineers has basically turned the River of Grass into a stagnant drainage ditch, all so some idiots can build houses on top of what was once lush marshland teeming with life. The wading birds, alligators and Florida panthers have been pushed to the brink because we kept draining and developing their habitat like there was no tomorrow. 

And tomorrow may very well not come if we don't get our acts together. Scientists warn that rising sea levels from climate change could submerge the majority of South Florida in the next few decades. But the bozos who run this state refuse to lift a finger to address it. Instead, they keep approving new coastal high-rises and encouraging more people to move here and hasten our demise.

The loss of biodiversity is incredibly short-sighted and troubling. Sure, mosquitoes suck and nobody likes deadly snakes like the eastern diamondback rattler slithering through their backyard. But those critters play vital roles in the ecosystem that we haven't begun to fully understand yet. Every time we pave over another acre, we could be disrupting nature's balance in ways that come back to bite us hard down the road.

Take a look at the hellish pit we call Lake Okeechobee. It was once a pristine, free-flowing lake surrounded by marshes. Now it's a polluted, slimy retention pond ringed by Big Sugar's chemical-laden fields and Leaky septic tanks. The coastal estuaries are getting clogged with toxic algae blooms from the lake's outflows. No-see-ums, lovebugs and Florida's other insufferable insect hordes are out in full force because the system's so out of whack.

What really frosts me is when some money-grubbing scumbag gets caught poaching bears, gators or those gorgeous little key deer down in the Florida Keys. For a few bucks, they'll wipe out entire species that have dwelled here for millennia before us humans showed up. All to make a tacky novelty jacket or grotesque belt buckle. It makes me sick.

We've laid waste to Florida's abundant natural splendor without so much as an ounce of regret. The Everglades, Big Cypress Swamp, the beach dunes...all sacrificed to the gods of unbridled Growth and Development. Our once-teeming woodlands and wetlands are being steadily bulldozed and drained to clear the way for more suburban cookie-cutter festering. It's criminal, if you ask me.

Mark my words, my sun-scorched friends in the Flamingo State. If we don't stop this onslaught, we won't have any semblance of our unique natural heritage left. Our children will inherit a flattened, paved, sterilized wasteland utterly devoid of our state's original charm and wonder. No more redbird mornings or whinnying chuck-will's-widow nights. Just an endless manmade expanse of sad strip malls, charmless subdivisions and abandoned condos.

Time to wake up and smell the termites, folks. Support green spaces and conservation areas. Protect what little wildlands we have left before they're swallowed up and gone forever. Our future—our kids' future—is getting bulldozed away right in front of our eyes. When it's gone, it's gone. So let's not sit back and let that happen, shall we?
