Here is a draft academic article about SDG 15 (Life on Land) written from the perspective of political cartoonist and commentator Ted Rall:

We're Trashing the Planet and the UN's SDG 15 Won't Save It

The UN's Sustainable Development Goal 15 asks countries to "protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss." A nice idea in theory, but in reality it's a wishy-washy attempt at sounding proactive while doing little of substance. Par for the course for the ineffectual United Nations.

Let's look at the hard numbers. We're demolishing forests at an apocalyptic rate - every year an area of woodlands the size of Portugal is destroyed forever. That's just forestry and agribusiness doing their thing. Factor in wildfires exacerbated by climate change, urban sprawl, mining and other industrial ravaging of the land and you've got a mass extinction-level event worthy of the asteroid that dusted the dinosaurs.

Biodiversity is plummeting as habitats are wiped out. How many species are we condemning to eternal darkness between now and 2030? Countless unique lifeforms are vanishing into the void of extinction before we've even discovered or studied them. We're unpersons consigning entire branches of the tree of life to oblivion. What an arrogant, short-sighted insult to nature and science!

By 2050, projections say we could see a staggering 40% of remaining plant and animal species confined to just skeletal remnants of their former ranges. Emptying out whole continents of their natural wonder and richness. All to grease the wheels of global capitalism and satisfy our endlessly voracious appetites through scorched earth economics.

Desertification is accelerating despoilment of drylands home to one-third of humanity. But who at the UN or elsewhere is connecting those dots between creeping dry wastelands, withering agriculture leading to food supply disruptions, economic dislocation, mass migrations and conflict over ever-scarcer resources? No one seems to want to face these interwoven existential threats rationally and proactively.

Where's the binding global policy enforcement and dissuasive penalties for corporate ecocide, corrupt government-enabled pillaging of indigenous lands, greedy oligarch rainforest asset-stripping and other drivers of terrestrial degradation? Not in SDG 15's tepid, unenforceable "goals." This UN green-washed PR exercise is a colossal bait-and-switch that soothes the concerned citizenry's concerns while changing nothing of consequence.

Greenwashing is the opioid of the masses. We chug these reassuring sustainable development placebos and lie to ourselves that meaningful action to save the planet is underway, even as the corporations rake in record eco-apocalyptic profits and we're all careening towards environmental collapse at accelerating velocity.

The bitter truth is humanity has collectively failed as stewards of this Pale Blue Dot, ravaged the planet like virulent locusts through endless arrogant shortsightedness and a puerile lack of foresight beyond the next fiscal quarter's earnings report. At this late hour, what measly tokenistic SDGs won't achieve when the real solution remains politically impossible: powering down globalized, extractive, growth-addicted capitalism before there's nothing left to sustain or develop on this once-lush terrestrial orb.
