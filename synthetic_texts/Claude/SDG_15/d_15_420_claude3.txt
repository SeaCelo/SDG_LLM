International Development Enterprises (IDE) is pleased to present this analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG 15), which aims to "protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, and halt biodiversity loss."

The urgency of addressing SDG 15 cannot be overstated. Terrestrial ecosystems, including forests, grasslands, and drylands, are under immense pressure from human activities such as deforestation, unsustainable agricultural practices, urbanization, and climate change. These pressures have led to widespread biodiversity loss, land degradation, and desertification, posing severe threats to global food security, water availability, and the livelihoods of millions of people, particularly in developing nations.

One of the key challenges in achieving SDG 15 is the complex interplay between environmental, social, and economic factors. Poverty, population growth, and unsustainable consumption patterns often drive overexploitation of natural resources, leading to environmental degradation. Conversely, environmental degradation exacerbates poverty by undermining the productivity of land and ecosystems upon which many communities rely for their livelihoods.

Addressing this challenge requires a holistic approach that integrates sustainable land management practices with community-based natural resource management and livelihood diversification strategies. IDE has been at the forefront of promoting such integrated approaches, particularly in dryland regions where desertification poses a significant threat.

Through our extensive work in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, we have implemented innovative solutions that balance environmental conservation with economic development. One example is our promotion of low-cost micro-irrigation technologies, such as treadle pumps and drip irrigation systems, which enable smallholder farmers to cultivate more land with less water, thereby reducing pressure on fragile ecosystems while enhancing food security and income generation.

Furthermore, IDE has pioneered the establishment of community-based forest management groups, empowering local communities to sustainably manage and benefit from their forest resources. These groups have played a crucial role in combating deforestation, restoring degraded lands, and promoting biodiversity conservation through activities such as reforestation, agroforestry, and sustainable harvesting of non-timber forest products.

Another critical aspect of our work is the promotion of climate-smart agriculture practices, including conservation agriculture, agroforestry, and integrated soil fertility management. These practices not only enhance the resilience of agricultural systems to climate change but also contribute to carbon sequestration, soil conservation, and biodiversity protection.

However, achieving SDG 15 requires concerted efforts from all stakeholders, including governments, private sector, civil society, and international organizations. IDE has actively engaged in policy dialogues and multi-stakeholder partnerships to advocate for enabling policy environments that promote sustainable land management and biodiversity conservation.

One notable example is our collaboration with the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) to implement the Sustainable Land Management and Resilient Production Landscapes project in Burkina Faso and Ethiopia. This project aims to combat land degradation and desertification through a combination of sustainable land management practices, community empowerment, and policy interventions.

Despite these efforts, significant challenges remain. Inadequate financing, weak governance structures, and limited awareness and capacity among stakeholders continue to hinder progress towards achieving SDG 15. Furthermore, the impacts of climate change, such as increased frequency and severity of droughts and extreme weather events, exacerbate the existing pressures on terrestrial ecosystems.

Moving forward, we must scale up successful approaches and leverage innovative technologies and financing mechanisms to accelerate progress. This includes promoting nature-based solutions, such as ecosystem restoration and sustainable forest management, which not only contribute to biodiversity conservation but also offer co-benefits in terms of climate change mitigation, adaptation, and resilience building.

Additionally, we must prioritize the integration of indigenous and local knowledge systems with scientific expertise, recognizing the invaluable contributions of traditional communities in sustainably managing and conserving terrestrial ecosystems.

In conclusion, achieving SDG 15 is a complex and multi-faceted challenge that requires a coordinated and sustained effort from all stakeholders. IDE remains committed to promoting sustainable land management practices, biodiversity conservation, and community empowerment through our innovative approaches and partnerships. By addressing the interdependencies between environmental, social, and economic factors, we can pave the way for a more sustainable and resilient future for all.
