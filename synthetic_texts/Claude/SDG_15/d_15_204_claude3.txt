Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 15 (Life on Land), written from the perspective of conservative columnist George Will:

The Sustainable Development Goals put forth by the United Nations represent a sweeping, misguided attempt by bureaucrats and ideologues to reshape human society through top-down diktats. Of the 17 goals, perhaps none is more emblematic of this hubristic overreach than SDG 15 — the call to "protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems." Let us analyze this extraordinarily ambitious objective through the lens of prudence and realism.

The goal statement itself begs numerous questions. What precisely constitutes "sustainable use" in the context of forests, wetlands, mountains and other ecosystems? By what criteria shall we judge whether these lands are being managed in a sustainable fashion? The UN offers no clear, quantifiable metrics, leaving ample room for conflicting interpretations colored by ideological biases.  

More fundamentally, we must query the unstated premise that Earth's terrestrial environments currently suffer existential threats requiring urgent global intervention. The reality is that many ecological indicators have been improving, not deteriorating. Contrary to doomsday rhetoric about escalating desertification, satellite monitoring reveals the planet was greener last year than in 2015, with impressive vegetation gains across semi-arid regions like the Sahel. Forest cover has remained stable in recent decades despite relentless warnings of impending arboreal apocalypse.  

That's not to say conservation efforts are unnecessary or unwise. But such initiatives are best pursued incrementally through personal stewardship, local policies suited to bioregional contexts, and private property regimes that align owners' incentives with sustainable cultivation. National parks and wildlife reserves have an important role to play as well. But edicts to "sustainably manage all types of forests" and "combat desertification" on a planetary scale exhibit a arrogant disregard for the staggering complexity of ecological systems.  

We humans, for all our technological capabilities, still understand ecosystems imperfectly at best. Our knowledge remains inchoate for determining carrying capacities or optimal management strategies for the staggering diversity of terrestrial habitats. Geo-engineering on such a grand scale exceeds our intellectual grasp and institutional competence.  

Further, SDG 15 involves inherent value tradeoffs unacknowledged by its proponents. Efforts to maximize biodiversity, increase forest cover or expand protected areas inevitably conflict with other worthy priorities like economic development, housing expansion or resource extraction. These tradeoffs implicate complex ethical questions for which there are no obvious right answers. Who decides the appropriate balance – unelected bureaucrats at the UN, academics cloistered in ivory towers, or the people most directly affected through democratic processes?  

More fundamentally, what moral philosophy shall govern such wrenching decisions? Many in the environmental clerisy venerate nature above all, exhibiting an eco-monastic disdain for human material ambitions. From their perspective, anthropocentric "destruction" of wilderness ranks as an intrinsic evil calling for atonement through self-denial and eco-asceticism.  

But humanity's creative cultivation and judicious pruning of nature is not invariably hubristic. Through agriculture, urbanization and responsible development, we advance the noble cause of human flourishing and societal progress — core tenets of the Enlightenment project to which SDG 15's worldview represents a reactionary countervail.  

As the late philosopher Sir Roger Scruton observed, "To the question 'Why preserve nature?' the answer is ultimately human." Unspoiled landscapes have precious instrumental value for ecosystem services, spiritual renewal, recreation and scientific inquiry. But imposing environmental blanket diktats without regard for human welfare or democratic accountability marks a concerning attempt at one-size-fits-all environmental absolutism.

Rather than unilateral submission to SDG 15's agenda, we would be wiser to uphold the liberal principle of free peoples pursuing diverse social contracts through persuasion rather than coercion. In this spirit, environmental initiatives should germinate organically from decentralized, democratic processes attuned to local values, priorities and contexts. Top-down planetary dictation belies both economic rationality and Burkean respect for evolved social traditions.

The unbounded ambition of SDG 15 exemplifies the arrogance intrinsic to technocratic grand plans seeking to harmonize all sectors of human endeavor into a rigidly-defined global order. A more prudent path focuses on the little platoons of civic life — the households, communities and institutions most proximate to local ecological realities. From such roots can responsible environmental policies gradually emerge through trial, error and accretion, rather than bureaucratic ukase. Providence over power; stewardship over imperial engineering.
