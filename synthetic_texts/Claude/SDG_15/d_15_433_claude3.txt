Mercy Corps' latest report on Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG 15) – Life on Land – presents a sobering assessment of the global community's progress in protecting, restoring, and promoting sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems. Despite concerted efforts, the world is alarmingly off-track in achieving this crucial goal, with far-reaching implications for biodiversity, ecological resilience, and human well-being.

The report highlights the alarming rate of deforestation, driven by unsustainable agricultural practices, illegal logging, and infrastructure development. Every year, vast swaths of pristine forests – Earth's natural carbon sinks and biodiversity havens – are lost, exacerbating climate change and pushing countless species to the brink of extinction. The situation is particularly dire in the Amazon, Congo Basin, and Southeast Asian rainforests, where deforestation rates have reached unprecedented levels.

Desertification, a process exacerbated by climate change and unsustainable land management, is another pressing concern. Arable land is rapidly turning into desert, threatening food security and livelihoods of millions, particularly in the Sahel region of Africa and parts of Central Asia. The report emphasizes the urgent need for sustainable land management practices, such as agroforestry, conservation agriculture, and regenerative grazing, to reverse this trend.

Mercy Corps' findings also underscore the inextricable link between biodiversity loss and human well-being. The report highlights the alarming decline in species populations across terrestrial ecosystems, with vertebrate populations declining by an average of 68% since 1970. This loss of biodiversity not only threatens ecological balance but also jeopardizes the provision of essential ecosystem services, such as pollination, water purification, and soil fertility, upon which human societies depend.

The report acknowledges the significant progress made in establishing protected areas, with nearly 15% of the world's terrestrial and freshwater environments now under protection. However, it also emphasizes the need for effective management and enforcement, as many protected areas suffer from encroachment, poaching, and illegal activities.

Mercy Corps' analysis underscores the disproportionate impact of environmental degradation on indigenous communities and marginalized populations, who often rely directly on natural resources for their livelihoods and cultural practices. The report highlights the importance of recognizing and preserving traditional knowledge systems and ensuring the meaningful participation of these communities in conservation efforts.

To address these pressing challenges, the report calls for a comprehensive and integrated approach that addresses the root causes of environmental degradation. This includes:

1. Strengthening governance and policy frameworks: Robust environmental laws, effective enforcement mechanisms, and participatory decision-making processes are essential to ensure sustainable land management and conservation efforts.

2. Promoting sustainable agriculture and land management: Scaling up regenerative and climate-smart agricultural practices, such as agroforestry, conservation tillage, and integrated pest management, can help reduce environmental impact while enhancing food security.

3. Investing in ecosystem restoration: Large-scale ecosystem restoration initiatives, such as reforestation and wetland rehabilitation, are crucial to restore ecological balance and enhance resilience to climate change.

4. Combating illegal wildlife trade and poaching: Strengthening international cooperation, enhancing law enforcement, and raising awareness are key to curbing the illegal wildlife trade, which threatens biodiversity and undermines conservation efforts.

5. Addressing the drivers of environmental degradation: Tackling underlying socio-economic factors, such as poverty, lack of alternative livelihoods, and unsustainable consumption patterns, is critical to achieving lasting change.

Mercy Corps' report is a clarion call for urgent and transformative action to protect and restore terrestrial ecosystems. It emphasizes the need for global solidarity, cross-sectoral collaboration, and innovative financing mechanisms to mobilize resources and catalyze change at the scale and pace required. By highlighting the intrinsic value of biodiversity and the inextricable link between healthy ecosystems and human well-being, the report underscores the imperative of prioritizing SDG 15 as a cornerstone of sustainable development.
