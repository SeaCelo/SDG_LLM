Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 15 from the perspective of Andrew Bolt, a conservative Australian commentator skeptical of international climate change initiatives:

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 15 - to "protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems" - represents a thinly-veiled attempt by unelected globalists to subvert national sovereignty and impose draconian environmental regulations. This insidious agenda, cloaked in the lofty rhetoric of protecting forests and biodiversity, conceals a sinister plan for centralized control over land use, property rights, and resource extraction. 

The very notion that humanity is a mere trespasser upon the natural world, whose presence must be carefully managed and mitigated by enlightened bureaucrats, constitutes an affront to Western civilization's ethos of human mastery over nature. From the biblical injunction to subdue the earth to the Promethean conquests of the Enlightenment and Industrial Age, our culture's ascent was predicated upon defiant dominion and exploitation of the wilderness for mankind's enrichment.

To accept SDG 15's premises is to repudiate this proud legacy and succumb to an atavistic nature-worship, elevating plants and fauna above humankind's prerogatives. The apocalyptic language of "biodiversity loss" and "degraded habitats" merely provides a pseudoscientific veneer for what is essentially a neo-pagan religion that prioritizes the ephemeral whims of the climate over timeless human needs for shelter, sustenance, and economic development.

Moreover, SDG 15 cynically co-opts valid concerns over desertification and drought to propagate radical green propositions like conserving "mountain ecosystems" - an utterly superfluous objective given that these inhospitable environments have negligible bearing on human flourishing. Meanwhile, desperately impoverished nations rich in natural resources are effectively condemned to perpetual underdevelopment in the name of "sustainable forest management."

Ultimately, this counterproductive SDG exemplifies how the United Nations has become a vehicle for undermining Western nations and free market capitalism under the guise of altruism. The nebulous rhetoric of "restoring degraded land" provides a pretext for unlimited interventionism while "ecosystem services" obfuscates an underlying agenda to constrain resource usage and erode property rights.

Rather than capitulating to these watermelon "green on the outside, red on the inside" machinations, sovereign governments should steadfastly resist such eco-imperialism. Conservation and sustainability are legitimate concerns best addressed through national policies and market mechanisms - not unaccountable, anti-growth diktats from a bloated Utopian bureaucracy. The path to genuine ecological equilibrium lies not in deindustrialization, but harnessing human ingenuity to transcend nature's limitations, not rever them.
