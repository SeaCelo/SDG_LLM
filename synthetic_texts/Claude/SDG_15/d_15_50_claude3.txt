Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 15 (Life on Land), written from the perspective of Australian author Nikki Gemmell:

The Weight of the World's Forests
By Nikki Gemmell

I've always been drawn to the primal power and mystery of forests. As a girl, I would wander for hours under the sheltering canopy of gum trees that surrounded my childhood home, intoxicated by the woody scents and the whispers of unseen life teeming all around me. The forest was a whole other universe parallel to our cultivated human realm, ancient and infinitely complex. I felt humbled and somehow held by its enveloping presence. 

Even now, stepping beneath towering trunks and filigreed branches, I'm struck by the indisputability of their reality. These are not mere biochemical assemblages, but vessels throbbing with cryptic sentience. They precede us, will likely succeed us, yet cannot survive without us. This paradox lies at the heart of the 15th Sustainable Development Goal: to "protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems."

On the surface, SDG 15 represents an earnest if bureaucratic endeavor to codify environmental best practices: sustainable forest management, halting desertification, ensuring conservation of mountain ecosystems. But looking closer, I see the culmination of an age-old preoccupation - humanity's paradoxical relationship with the very terrain that birthed and sustains us. 

We have long romanticized the wild, untamed aspects of nature, even as we aggressively subjugated these landscapes to our domestic needs. Early civilizations deforested en masse to produce agricultural land and timber for construction. Later, great swaths of old-growth forests were felled for paper, furniture, shipbuilding. By the 20th century, wanton clearing had denuded an estimated half of the world's forests, inflicting catastrophic losses of biodiversity.

Yet our innate arboreal fascination persisted. We extolled the restorative power of woodlands. Romantic poets and transcendental thinkers venerated forests as repositories of primal wisdom. Aboriginal cultures embraced animistic beliefs about the sentience of all living things. Even modern science corroborates the sophisticated biochemical relationships between trees and their symbiotic surroundings. 

Humanity, it seems, is unable to slake its thirst for trees. We desire their beauty, their utility, their mystical capacity to renew us. Yet our depredations continue to decimate these ancient ecosystems, driven by an ever-expanding population's escalating needs for land, pulp, fuel, food and shelter.

Today, commercial agriculture and mining ravage the Amazon. Central Africa hemorrhages forests to supply the rapacious international timber trade. Russia's taiga is scarred by rampant illegal logging. Even emblematic landscapes like Germany's Black Forest endure the incursions of developers and extractive industries.

And this is to say nothing of the compounded threats of climate change, which exacerbates drought, fires, invasive species and the generalized loss of biodiversity - the very biological infrastructure keeping these ecosystems resilient. Under this multiplicity of assaults, we may witness the precipitous unravelling of our planet's terrestrial life support systems within decades.

With SDG 15, we have attempted to arrest this arboreal apocalypse through a typically human exercise: itemizing goals, targets, indicators. Initiatives like REDD+ marshal global cooperation and funding to reduce emissions from deforestation. Countries have committed to expanding protected areas, combating poaching and trafficking of protected fauna and flora, sharing the benefits of genetic resources equitably, and mobilizing resources from all sources to finance sustainable forest management.

It all sounds so orderly, so bloodlessly practical. But I can't help viewing this mobilization through the lens of our primordial sylvan bond. Because at its core, this is not about sustainable development or creating a world to pass on to the next generation. It is an effort to preserve humanity's age-old symbiosis with arboreal collaborators more ancient, wise and deserving of reverence than we can fathom.

Perhaps, underneath our compulsive despoiling, we intuit that our very souls are rooted in these forests. That we cannot ultimately exist without their mysteries enclosing and renewing us. These mute, verticalized beings embody nature's gravitational pull, an ancestral summons away from the cultivated, commodified grids of our constructed world and back to a primal continuum we've never fully relinquished.

When I wandered those eucalyptus groves, I was closer to this inarticulable understanding. The dappled light, the canopy's cathedral hush, the drift of leaf and loam perfuming the air - these anchored me to the arboreal essence we've always yearned for. Because forests aren't resources to be sustainably managed, indicators to be optimized, or even ecosystemic services dutifully rendering their utilitarian benefit. They are the verdant mystics of the terrestrial world, their primeval vitality flowing into our very sinews, reminding us that we remain, inescapably, wild beings under the canopy.
