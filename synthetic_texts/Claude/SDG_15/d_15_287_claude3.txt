Here is a draft academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 15 (Life on Land), written from the perspective of George A. Akerlof, the renowned economist and Nobel laureate:

Sustaining Life on Land: An Economic Perspective on Halting Biodiversity Loss
By George A. Akerlof

The biodiversity crisis represents one of the greatest market failures of our time. Ecosystems teeming with millions of species provide invaluable services - pollination, water purification, carbon sequestration, and more - that are essential for human prosperity and survival. Yet traditional economic models have drastically undervalued these natural assets, externalizing their depletion as costs borne by society rather than the entities exploiting them. This market imperfection has precipitated a catastrophic decline in biodiversity, imperiling our collective wellbeing and future prosperity.

It is a classic case of the "Tragedy of the Commons" problem I elucidated in my 1970 paper - when individuals act rationally in their own self-interest by over-exploiting unregulated, open-access resources, it leads to disastrous outcomes for society. Deforestation, poaching, overfishing, pollution, and habitat destruction are all rational for entities maximizing their own profits while ignoring the broader social costs of biodiversity degradation. From an economic perspective, rampant biodiversity loss stems directly from informational asymmetries and a failure to properly value and protect ecological commons.

We have blind faith in markets, but their inability to efficiently sustain our natural capital represents a colossal informational failure. Akerlof's "lemons problem" - where quality uncertainty causes good products to be undervalued and driven out of markets - applies perfectly here. Markets chronically undervalue high-quality, biodiverse ecosystems due to severe informational asymmetries around their dynamism, resilience, and worth. As a result, low-quality degraded habitats proliferate as the unseen value of intact ones goes unappreciated.  

This informational disconnect is compounded by misaligned incentives between the present and future. Like the "hyperbolic discounting" that leads individuals to over-consume today at the expense of leaner times ahead, corporations and governments discount the value of biodiversity's future benefits too steeply, opting for policies that degrade our ecological inheritance. Collectively, we borrow ruthlessly against Nature's capital stock through unsustainable rates of resource extraction and habitat loss.  

To reverse these trends and uphold SDG 15, we must rectify both the informational and incentive failures driving the biodiversity crisis. Informational remedies include improving biodiversity monitoring and disclosure, conducting more comprehensive environmental impact assessments, and better quantifying ecosystems' manifold economic contributions through natural capital accounting. Embedding the full value of biodiversity into companies' financial statements and national economic metrics could dramatically shift incentives.

Beyond valuation, robust governance regimes, judicious regulation, and innovative market-based instruments are needed to realign incentives for biodiversity preservation. Polluting and habitat destruction must be disincentivized through mechanisms like emissions pricing and biodiversity offsets, complemented by conservation-oriented subsidies and tax policies. Community-based natural resource management, eco-certification schemes, and payments for ecosystem services can engage the private sector in driving sustainable land stewardship. 

Most critically, we must recognize biodiversity's incalculable option value - the inherent worth of preserving Nature's rich genetic library from which future scientists and entrepreneurs can develop innovations to enhance human welfare in currently unimaginable ways. The resilience of life itself depends on this biodiversity, and its impoverishment irreversibly forecloses opportunities we can scarcely comprehend. Economists must elevate their wildness valuation game beyond crass utilitarianism to appreciate biodiversity's full existential significance.

Averting Earth's sixth mass extinction event and upholding SDG 15 requires transcending our chronic market failures and finally internalizing biodiversity's true value. It demands a fundamental reformation of our economic models, governance systems, and ethical mindsets to recognize ecological preservation as the paramount imperative for intergenerational prosperity. The path of "business as usual" blindly consigns our descendants to an apocalyptic bushscape. To truly sustain humanity's life on land, the rationality of our economic thinking must finally be redeemed.
