The Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID) is pleased to present this comprehensive analysis of Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG 15): "Life on Land." This critical goal seeks to protect, restore, and promote the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, and curb biodiversity loss.

Globally, land degradation remains a pressing challenge. Recent data reveals that over 20% of agricultural land worldwide has experienced significant productivity declines in the past two decades. This situation threatens food security and the livelihoods of millions, especially in the planet's most vulnerable regions. Desertification, driven by climate change and unsustainable land-use practices, continues to spread, adversely affecting ecosystems and the communities that depend on them.

Biodiversity loss is another alarming issue. According to the 2019 Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, approximately one million species are at risk of extinction, many within the coming decades. This unprecedented crisis is primarily attributed to human activity, such as habitat destruction, overexploitation of natural resources, pollution, and climate change.

Forests, essential for maintaining biodiversity and mitigating climate change, face similarly concerning challenges. Deforestation continues at an alarming rate, with a net loss of 4.7 million hectares of forest annually between 2010 and 2020, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). This trend jeopardizes not only the species inhabiting these ecosystems but also the vital ecosystem services forests provide, such as climate regulation, water purification, and soil erosion prevention.

Despite these challenges, progress has been made. In recent years, significant strides have been achieved in protecting terrestrial and marine areas. The 2019 Global Environment Outlook Report highlights that globally protected terrestrial areas increased from 10% in 1994 to 15% in 2018. Additionally, initiatives such as the Bonn Challenge aim to restore 350 million hectares of deforested and degraded land by 2030.

Much work remains to achieve SDG 15, and AECID is committed to this goal through various projects and programs. For example, in Peru, AECID has supported the creation of a Network of Protected Natural Areas, covering over 17 million hectares and representing approximately 13.5% of the national territory. This project has significantly contributed to biodiversity conservation and the protection of fragile ecosystems such as Amazonian forests and Andean landscapes.

In Morocco, AECID has collaborated on implementing the Desertification Control Program, which has helped restore over 600,000 hectares of degraded land through reforestation and sustainable natural resource management. Local communities have also been trained in soil and water conservation techniques, enhancing their resilience to the impacts of climate change.

These examples showcase AECID's efforts to promote SDG 15. However, achieving this goal requires the collaboration of all stakeholders, from governments to the private sector and civil society. Strong policies, substantial investments, and unwavering commitment are essential to reverse current trends and secure a sustainable future for our terrestrial ecosystems and the biodiversity they harbor.
