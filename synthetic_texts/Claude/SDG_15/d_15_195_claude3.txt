Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 15 (Life on Land), written from the perspective of conservative columnist Cal Thomas:

The 15th Sustainable Development Goal laid out by the United Nations seeks to "protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss." On its surface, this appears to be a laudable and moral objective that aligns with biblical commands to be good stewards of God's creation. Yet in examining the specific targets and indicators involved, one finds an agenda cloaked in environmentalist ideology that is antipathetic to human flourishing.

The targets speak of ensuring "conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems," with indicators monitoring forest area, biodiversity protections, and prevention of species extinction. Taken at face value, these aims could find support across the ideological spectrum. But what do the UN's experts and bureaucrats really mean by "sustainable use"? History has shown that their definition leaves little room for resource extraction, commercial development, or the material progress that has allowed billions to be lifted from poverty.

We need look no further than the restrictive land-use policies that have made housing unaffordable in places like California, or the endless protests against any form of logging, mining or fossil fuel extraction on federal lands. The radical environmentalists who have captured institutions like the UN see human economic activity and expansion as a scourge to be stamped out, not a force for societal advancement. Their vision of "sustainability" freezes landscapes in an untouched, primordial state, forbidding the very anthropogenic influences that give meaning to the concept of husbandry.

The indicators also monitor something called the "Red List Index" - a measure of anthropogenic risks to biological species. But what about accounting for the human cost when over-aggressive preservation policies block development for the world's poorest? When anti-DDT hysteria caused millions of preventable malaria deaths? When opposition to mechanized agriculture and genetically modified crops perpetuates hunger and malnutrition?

There can be no question that responsible stewardship of the land and biodiversity is a principle firmly rooted in the Judeo-Christian tradition. But the environmentalists have perverted this ethic into a neo-pagan nature worship that rejects mankind's divine role as earth's caretaker and cultivator. We are not meant to keep the planet in a museum-like diorama, but to prune, replenish, and sustainably harvest God's bounty for the benefit of human civilization.

If the UN were serious about empowering countries to "combat desertification, restore degraded land and soil" and promote development that avoids "biodiversity loss," they would champion free market policies that incentivize environmental preservation. Private property rights, compensation for environmental stewardship, and market-based cap-and-trade systems have proven far more effective at balancing conservation and economic growth than top-down government diktats and obstructionist litigation.

The biblical model is one where mankind is given "dominion" over the earth's resources while also being commanded to "work and keep" the garden - extracting value through industry and agriculture, while replenishing what we consume. SDG 15 gives lip service to these principles while ultimately pursuing the misanthropic agenda of spiritual environmentalism that sees humanity itself as the virus from which nature must be protected. It deserves skepticism from all people of faith and reason.
