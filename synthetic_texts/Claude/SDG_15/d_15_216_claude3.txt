Safeguarding Life on Land: An Economic Perspective on SDG 15 and the Imperative of Sustainable Development

By Kenneth S. Rogoff 

As we navigate the complex challenges of the 21st century, few issues demand our attention more urgently than the preservation of life on land. The 15th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG), which aims to "protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss," represents a vital imperative for the global community.

From an economic standpoint, the case for prioritizing SDG 15 is compelling. Terrestrial ecosystems, with their rich biodiversity and intricate web of life, are not mere aesthetic luxuries but foundational pillars of human well-being and economic prosperity. The services provided by these ecosystems, from soil formation and nutrient cycling to water purification and climate regulation, underpin virtually every sector of the global economy.

Consider, for instance, the critical role played by pollinators, which include bees, birds, bats, and other animals. These unsung heroes are responsible for the pollination of over 75% of the world's flowering plants, including many of the crops that sustain human civilization. The estimated annual value of pollination services worldwide exceeds $200 billion, a staggering figure that underscores the profound economic consequences of pollinator decline.

Moreover, the loss of biodiversity and degradation of terrestrial ecosystems can precipitate cascading economic impacts that transcend national borders. The erosion of soil fertility, for example, can undermine agricultural productivity, exacerbating food insecurity and heightening geopolitical tensions. Similarly, deforestation and habitat destruction can disrupt delicate climatic systems, amplifying the risk of natural disasters and resource scarcity.

To address these challenges, a comprehensive economic approach is essential. We must recognize that the preservation of life on land is not a luxury but a strategic investment in our collective future. This requires a fundamental shift in how we value and account for natural capital, integrating the true costs of ecosystem services and biodiversity loss into our economic decision-making.

One promising avenue is the adoption of market-based instruments, such as carbon pricing and cap-and-trade systems, which internalize the environmental costs of economic activities and incentivize sustainable practices. Additionally, we must explore innovative financing mechanisms, such as green bonds and impact investing, to channel capital towards conservation efforts and sustainable land management initiatives.

Crucially, these economic measures must be accompanied by robust governance frameworks and international cooperation. Protecting life on land transcends national boundaries, necessitating a coordinated global response that harmonizes policies, shares best practices, and fosters collective action.

As we confront the existential threats posed by biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation, it is imperative that we adopt a holistic, interdisciplinary approach that integrates economic, ecological, and social considerations. By recognizing the profound economic value of life on land and embracing sustainable development as a strategic imperative, we can chart a path towards a more resilient, prosperous, and equitable future for all.
