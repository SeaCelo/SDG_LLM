Protecting and restoring terrestrial ecosystems in an inclusive and sustainable manner: A multidimensional policy imperative

By Simplice A. Asongu

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by the United Nations in 2015, set forth an ambitious and transformative blueprint for global progress. Among its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Goal 15 – "Life on Land" – stands as a clarion call to safeguard the planet's terrestrial ecosystems, combat desertification, halt biodiversity loss, and promote sustainable forest management. This multifaceted objective necessitates a holistic and multidimensional policy approach that transcends conventional development paradigms.

At the heart of SDG 15 lies the recognition that terrestrial ecosystems are the bedrock of human existence, providing a multitude of essential services – from food and water to climate regulation and disease control. Yet, these vital systems are under relentless assault from unsustainable human activities, including deforestation, land degradation, poaching, and pollution. As a consequence, we are witnessing an unprecedented loss of biodiversity, with species extinction rates accelerating at an alarming pace.

Addressing this crisis demands a paradigm shift in how we perceive and value our terrestrial ecosystems. Rather than viewing them as mere resources to be exploited, we must embrace a more holistic perspective that acknowledges their intrinsic value and recognizes their critical role in sustaining life on Earth. This shift necessitates a comprehensive policy framework that integrates economic, social, and environmental considerations, while also accounting for the unique cultural and historical contexts of different regions and communities.

One key aspect of this multidimensional approach is the promotion of sustainable land management practices. This involves incentivizing and supporting agricultural techniques that minimize soil erosion, water depletion, and biodiversity loss, while simultaneously enhancing food security and rural livelihoods. Agroecology, agroforestry, and conservation agriculture are among the promising strategies that can contribute to this endeavor, fostering resilient and productive landscapes that support both human well-being and ecological integrity.

Furthermore, combating desertification and land degradation must be a global priority, as these processes not only threaten food production and water security but also exacerbate climate change and biodiversity loss. Effective policies should prioritize sustainable land-use planning, ecosystem restoration, and the empowerment of local communities to manage their natural resources in a sustainable manner. This requires integrating traditional knowledge systems with modern scientific insights, fostering cross-cultural collaboration, and ensuring equitable access to land and resources.

Protecting and restoring forests is also a critical component of SDG 15, as these ecosystems play a vital role in regulating the global climate, preserving biodiversity, and supporting the livelihoods of millions of people. Policies should incentivize sustainable forest management, curb illegal logging, and promote reforestation and afforestation efforts. However, these initiatives must be designed and implemented in a manner that respects the rights and aspirations of indigenous and local communities, whose traditional knowledge and stewardship practices have long sustained these invaluable ecosystems.

Underpinning these efforts is the need for robust governance frameworks that foster transparency, accountability, and inclusive decision-making processes. This involves strengthening institutional capacities, enhancing cross-sectoral coordination, and ensuring meaningful participation of all stakeholders, including marginalized and vulnerable groups. Additionally, innovative financing mechanisms, such as payments for ecosystem services, carbon markets, and public-private partnerships, can mobilize the necessary resources to support sustainable land management initiatives.

Ultimately, achieving SDG 15 requires a transformative shift in our collective mindset – one that recognizes the inextricable link between human well-being and the health of terrestrial ecosystems. By embracing a multidimensional policy approach that integrates economic, social, and environmental considerations, we can chart a course toward a more sustainable and equitable future, where human development and ecological integrity are mutually reinforcing, rather than competing, objectives.
