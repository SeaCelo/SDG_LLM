Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 15 (Life on Land), written from the perspective of Margaret Wente:

The Road to Oblivion: How the Global Agenda on Biodiversity Is Failing

By Margaret Wente

The Sustainable Development Goals laid out an ambitious vision for protecting life on land by 2030. Yet as we approach the halfway mark, the scorecard is dismal. Despite lofty rhetoric and choreographed efforts by activist groups, the worldwide losses of forests, biodiversity and vital ecosystems continue unabated. We are losing the war.

The reasons are as familiar as they are intractable. Human population growth and humanity's insatiable demand for land, water and resources are squeezing nature into an ever-diminishing corner. The greatest threat comes from the developing world's race to emulate Western consumer lifestyles, which require flattening forests to make way for agriculture, mining, roads and cities. Even in the West, some of the worst losses come from suburban sprawl that devours habitats and the relentless drive to convert wild lands to commercial uses.

Not even protected areas are safe anymore. Parks and conservation zones worldwide are under siege from illegal poaching, mining and logging operations that bribe corrupt officials to look the other way. Well-meaning Western conservation groups spend millions on enforcement, only to be easily outmatched by international criminal cartels.

Of course, no discussion of biodiversity would be complete without mentioning climate change – the ubiquitous culprit that conveniently explains every ecological problem these days. But the Armageddon predicted by climate models is still decades away. The more pressing drivers of mass extinction come from good old human rapaciousness and greed.

If any creatures illustrate humanity's rapacious relationship with nature, it is the African elephants and rhinos – two iconic species pushed to the brink by industrial-scale poaching. Despite Herculean efforts (and millions in foreign aid) to save them, they remain in a precarious downward spiral thanks to insatiable demand for ivory and rhino horn in Asia.

Similar calamities afflict many lesser-known species and their habitats – the countless forests laid bare, the grasslands turned to deserts, the rivers and wetlands drained and polluted to oblivion. With nature in full retreat, this great unraveling undermines vital ecosystems that humanity depends upon for water, food, medicine and shelter.

Yet instead of owning up to these hard truths, most of the conservation movement prefers to wallow in obfuscation and denial. They continue to peddle a fantasy worldview that depicts indigenous peoples and traditional communities as exemplars of environmental wisdom – even as these same groups raze forests and kill wildlife with abandon whenever it suits their economic interests. The conservationists demonize Western corporations, which, however imperfectly, have far better environmental standards than most developing nations

Most solutions to the biodiversity crisis founder on hard realities. The sustainable development gurus call for protecting the lands and resources of indigenous groups. But unless population growth is radically curbed, these lands will inevitably be needed to feed future generations – whose first imperative will be to eat, not to preserve ancient traditions.

Developed nations are supposed to lead by example, limiting their ecological footprints and "decoupling" GDP growth from environmental harm. But good luck with that. The Paris Agreement on climate emissions is already failing, and richer nations show no willingness to change their lifestyles or assume a doctrine of eco-austerity that might make a difference.

The conservationists argue for "sustainable" development, ecotourism and other ways for communities to benefit from preserving nature. These are fine in theory but difficult to pull off in practice – especially in areas torn by war, corruption or misrule. Even well-meaning plans to integrate conservation and development routinely succumb to tragedy-of-the-commons syndromes as human pressures escalate.

Fundamentally, this is a crisis of human ethics and human governance. We have failed to instill a scale of values that regards all life as sacred – whether that life takes the form of an animal, a tree, a meadow or a stream. Until we create systems of custodial protection with real enforcement "teeth," we will continue to desecrate the natural wonders entrusted to our care.

Time is running out. By 2050, the world must support an estimated 9 billion inhabitants. Unless we change course, that ultimate dream of sustainable development will fast become a nihilistic nightmare – nothing more than the unsustainable strip-mining of a dying planet. The hour is late, and our civic and moral deficit has never been greater.

In that light, SDG 15 begins to look more like a mirage instead of a realistic goal – just another futile gesture from a woefully inadequate global community whose real faith lies not in environmental redemption, but in a reckless belief that infinite growth can somehow be sustainable on a very finite planet.
