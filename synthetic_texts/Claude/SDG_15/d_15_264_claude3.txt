Life on Land: An Economic Perspective on SDG 15 by N. Gregory Mankiw

The preservation of terrestrial ecosystems and the sustainable management of forests, combating desertification, halting and reversing land degradation, and stemming biodiversity loss are at the core of Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG 15). While the environmental and ecological imperatives are clear, we must also consider the economic dimensions of this goal to ensure its effective implementation and long-term viability.

From an economic standpoint, the concept of market failure is central to understanding the challenges associated with SDG 15. Natural resources, including forests, wildlife habitats, and biodiversity, are often treated as common-pool resources, leading to the tragedy of the commons. When these resources are not properly managed or priced, they are susceptible to overexploitation and degradation, imposing significant negative externalities on society.

Market-based instruments, such as carbon pricing and cap-and-trade systems, can play a crucial role in internalizing these externalities and incentivizing conservation efforts. By putting a price on environmental degradation, we create economic incentives for individuals, firms, and governments to adopt sustainable practices and invest in ecosystem preservation.

However, we must be mindful of the distributional impacts of such policies. Developing countries, which often rely heavily on natural resource extraction for economic growth and poverty alleviation, may face disproportionate burdens. Thus, it is crucial to consider mechanisms for compensating these countries, such as international transfers or debt-for-nature swaps, to ensure a just transition towards sustainability.

Furthermore, sustainable land management practices, such as agroforestry, conservation agriculture, and integrated pest management, can not only protect ecosystems but also enhance agricultural productivity and resilience. By investing in research and development, and promoting the adoption of these practices through extension services and targeted subsidies, we can achieve a synergy between environmental protection and economic development.

Addressing the drivers of land degradation, such as unsustainable agricultural practices, urbanization, and infrastructure development, requires a comprehensive policy approach. Land-use planning, zoning regulations, and environmental impact assessments can help mitigate the adverse effects of these activities on terrestrial ecosystems.

Moreover, we must recognize the value of ecosystem services, such as water purification, climate regulation, and pollination, which are often overlooked in traditional economic accounting. By developing mechanisms to quantify and incorporate these values into decision-making processes, we can better align economic incentives with environmental preservation.

Ultimately, achieving SDG 15 requires a delicate balance between economic development and environmental sustainability. It necessitates a paradigm shift towards a green economy, where economic growth is decoupled from environmental degradation, and the true value of natural capital is recognized and accounted for.

Collaborative efforts between governments, businesses, civil society, and indigenous communities are essential in this endeavor. By leveraging economic instruments, promoting sustainable practices, and fostering international cooperation, we can create a world where thriving terrestrial ecosystems coexist with prosperous economies, ensuring a sustainable future for all.
