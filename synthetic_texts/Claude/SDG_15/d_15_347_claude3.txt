As the Development Bank of Southern Africa, our commitment to Sustainable Development Goal 15 – Life on Land – is unwavering. This goal aims to protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, and halt biodiversity loss. Our region's rich biodiversity and unique ecosystems are under immense pressure from unsustainable land use practices, climate change, and human activities.

Habitat loss and degradation remain the primary drivers of biodiversity decline in Southern Africa. The region's diverse landscapes, ranging from savannas and grasslands to deserts and montane forests, are increasingly fragmented due to expanding agricultural frontiers, urbanization, and infrastructure development. This fragmentation disrupts ecological corridors, isolating populations and impeding species' migration and dispersal, ultimately leading to local extinctions.

Unsustainable agricultural practices, such as overgrazing, monoculture cultivation, and excessive use of agrochemicals, have contributed significantly to land degradation and soil erosion. These practices not only diminish the productivity of arable lands but also pose severe threats to terrestrial ecosystems. Desertification, exacerbated by climate change and unsustainable land management, is a pressing concern, particularly in the region's arid and semi-arid areas.

Illegal wildlife trade and poaching have decimated several iconic species, such as rhinoceros, elephants, and pangolins, in Southern Africa. Driven by demand for wildlife products in global markets, this illicit trade undermines conservation efforts and threatens the survival of numerous species. Furthermore, the introduction of invasive alien species, both intentionally and unintentionally, has disrupted native ecosystems, outcompeting indigenous species and altering ecological dynamics.

Climate change poses a formidable challenge to terrestrial ecosystems in Southern Africa. Rising temperatures, shifting precipitation patterns, and extreme weather events are rapidly altering the region's landscapes, rendering some habitats inhospitable and forcing species to adapt or migrate. This phenomenon exacerbates existing pressures on biodiversity and ecosystem services, making conservation efforts more complex and urgent.

To address these challenges, we at the Development Bank of Southern Africa are committed to promoting sustainable land management practices, investing in ecosystem restoration initiatives, and supporting innovative solutions that balance economic development and environmental conservation.

One of our flagship programs is the Southern African Ecosystem Resilience Initiative (SAERI), which aims to enhance ecosystem resilience and biodiversity conservation through collaborative efforts with governments, local communities, and civil society organizations. SAERI focuses on establishing and strengthening protected area networks, implementing sustainable land use practices, and promoting alternative livelihoods that reduce pressure on natural resources.

Furthermore, we are actively supporting research and development in sustainable agriculture, promoting climate-smart practices, and facilitating knowledge transfer to smallholder farmers. By encouraging techniques such as agroforestry, conservation agriculture, and integrated pest management, we aim to increase agricultural productivity while minimizing environmental impacts and safeguarding biodiversity.

Our investments in eco-tourism and community-based natural resource management initiatives empower local communities to become stewards of their natural heritage. These initiatives not only create economic opportunities but also incentivize conservation efforts and foster a sense of ownership over local ecosystems.

Recognizing the transboundary nature of environmental challenges, we are facilitating regional cooperation and knowledge sharing among Southern African nations. Cross-border initiatives, such as the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area (KAZA), exemplify our commitment to promoting collaborative approaches to ecosystem management and biodiversity conservation.

Moreover, we are actively engaging with the private sector, encouraging sustainable business practices, and leveraging innovative financing mechanisms, such as green bonds and impact investments, to mobilize resources for conservation and restoration efforts.

While challenges persist, our unwavering commitment to Sustainable Development Goal 15 drives us to explore innovative solutions, forge strategic partnerships, and empower local communities to become agents of change. By integrating environmental sustainability into our development strategies, we aim to strike a delicate balance between economic growth and ecosystem preservation, ensuring that the rich natural heritage of Southern Africa is safeguarded for future generations.
