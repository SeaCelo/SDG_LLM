Here is a long academic article about SDG 15 (Life on Land) written from the perspective of Maureen Dowd:

The Scorched Earth We're Leaving for Our Kids

If we don't wake up to the ecological Armageddon unfolding before our eyes, the world we leave for the next generation will be a veritable hell on earth. I'm talking widespread deforestation, rampant biodiversity loss, land degradation, and desertification. The ominous threat of drought and famine on a Biblical scale. Hellish wildfires consuming forests, homes, and lives with wanton disregard. And let's not forget dust bowls and soil too bereft of nutrients to cultivate crops.

It's a scorched earth dystopia that would make Cormac McCarthy recoil in horror. Though given the rate we're going, maybe The Road isn't just dark fiction but a glimpse into our grandchildren's reality if we don't get our act together. Because make no mistake, our society's parasitic relationship with the land is rapidly rendering vast swaths of terrain ill-suited to harbor life - whether plant, animal or human. 

This eviscerating devastation was precisely what the UN had in mind when they included "Life on Land" as one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals to create a more equitable and viable world by 2030. Specifically, SDG 15 urges coordinated global efforts to protect, restore and promote sustainable forest management, halt and reverse land degradation, end biodiversity loss, and ensure fair and equitable sharing of benefits from genetic resources.

To anyone paying even cursory attention, it's clear we're failing miserably on this front. Just look at the Brazilian Amazon - the so-called "lungs of the planet" - which has been ruthlessly plundered, burned, and exploited under Bolsonaro's ecocidal regime of wanton deforestation. Nearly 20% of the rainforest has been destroyed in under 50 years. An area larger than Alaska bearing incalculable biodiversity wiped out to make way for cattle ranches, soybean farms, and illicit mining operations that will profit a few while immiserating the planet.

And the Amazon is just the most visceral example. The U.N. estimates up to 135 million people may be displaced by 2045 due to desertification alone. Every year, the world loses an estimated 24 billion tons of fertile soil. A staggering 12 million hectares of forest are destroyed annually, displacing countless species and exacerbating climate change feedback loops that could render vast tracts of land uninhabitable.

It's carnage, a rapacious war on the natural systems that sustain human civilization. Yet we hypnotically march towards ecological ruination as if oblivious. Enthralled to our smartphones and SUVs, guzzling resources with disturbing abandon. Numbed by the quotidian drumbeat of apocalyptic headlines that by their sheer volume blend into background noise.

You have to wonder what sort of world we're leaving for our grandkids - a generation that may rightly revile us as the perpetrators of history's greatest crime against their right to inherit a verdant planet. They'll ridicule the arrogance and delusions that led us to sacrifice the land's bounty on the altar of quarterly earnings and economic "growth" at all costs. 

Perhaps they'll mourn the death of the rhino and so many other iconic species we permitted to wink out of existence with the same casual indifference as changing the channel. And they'll surely curse our colossal failure of stewardship when the droughts, famine and ferocious resource wars become too overwhelming to ignore any longer.

But maybe - just maybe - there's still a narrow window to defy the dystopian trajectory we seem headed towards. To summon the moral fortitude and clarity of purpose to heal and protect the wondrous ecosystems that make our planet so vibrant and life-affirming. To empower indigenous communities who've sustained symbiotic relationships with their lands for millennia. To reexamine our anthropocentric hubris and cultivate humility about our custodial role within the great majesty of nature.

The choice is ours. Do we pull back from the brink and revere the land that nourishes and sustains us all? Or do we march lockstep towards a harrowing ecological Armageddon, our grandchildren's accusing eyes searing into our souls as they inherit planetary ruin and deprivation from our morally bankrupt generation?

I know which path I choose. For the sake of all we claim to cherish - life, liberty, posterity - we must commit ourselves fully to the indigenous wisdom of living in harmony with the land. Embracing the compassion and spiritual grace to steward nature's resplendent splendor. Before it slips from our grasp forever.
