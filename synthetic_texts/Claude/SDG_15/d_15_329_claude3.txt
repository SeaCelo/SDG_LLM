Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) recognizes the critical importance of Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG 15), which aims to "Protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss." As a leading agency in international development cooperation, JICA has been actively engaged in various initiatives and projects to address the challenges associated with this goal.

JICA's approach to SDG 15 is multifaceted, encompassing various aspects of sustainable land management, ecosystem conservation, and biodiversity protection. One of the agency's key focus areas is the promotion of sustainable forest management practices. Deforestation and forest degradation are major contributors to biodiversity loss, land degradation, and climate change. JICA has been supporting developing countries in establishing sustainable forestry policies, strengthening governance frameworks, and implementing reforestation and afforestation programs.

In Indonesia, for instance, JICA has been instrumental in the implementation of the "Project for Sustainable Forest Management in Indonesia," which aims to enhance the country's capacity for sustainable forest management through technical assistance, training, and policy support. The project has contributed to the improvement of forest governance, the development of community-based forest management systems, and the promotion of sustainable timber production practices.

JICA's efforts in combating desertification and land degradation have also been noteworthy. In Africa's Sahel region, where desertification poses a significant threat to livelihoods and food security, JICA has been supporting initiatives that promote sustainable land management practices, such as agroforestry, soil conservation, and water resource management. The "Project for Sustainable Management of Natural Resources in the Sahel" in Niger has been particularly successful, contributing to the restoration of degraded lands and the improvement of agricultural productivity.

Biodiversity conservation is another critical component of JICA's work under SDG 15. The agency has been actively involved in supporting the establishment and management of protected areas, as well as promoting community-based natural resource management initiatives. In Cambodia, for instance, JICA has been working in partnership with the government and local communities to strengthen the management of the Tonle Sap Lake and its surrounding wetlands, which are home to numerous endangered species and provide essential ecosystem services.

JICA's approach to SDG 15 also recognizes the importance of capacity building and knowledge sharing. The agency has been actively engaged in providing technical assistance and training programs to partner countries, with a focus on enhancing their institutional capacities for sustainable land management, ecosystem conservation, and biodiversity protection. Additionally, JICA has been promoting research and knowledge dissemination on best practices and innovative solutions for addressing the challenges associated with SDG 15.

One of the key strengths of JICA's approach is its emphasis on community engagement and participatory approaches. The agency recognizes that sustainable land management and ecosystem conservation cannot be achieved without the active involvement and buy-in of local communities. JICA has been working closely with indigenous and rural communities, fostering their participation in decision-making processes, and supporting community-based natural resource management initiatives.

Furthermore, JICA's efforts under SDG 15 are closely aligned with other Sustainable Development Goals, such as SDG 13 (Climate Action), SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), and SDG 2 (Zero Hunger). This integrated approach recognizes the interconnectedness of environmental, social, and economic factors, and the need for holistic solutions that address multiple development challenges simultaneously.

While significant progress has been made, JICA acknowledges that achieving SDG 15 remains a formidable challenge, particularly in the face of increasing pressures from population growth, urbanization, and economic development. Addressing these challenges will require sustained efforts, innovative approaches, and strong partnerships among governments, civil society organizations, the private sector, and international development agencies.

JICA's commitment to SDG 15 is unwavering, and the agency will continue to play a pivotal role in promoting sustainable land management, ecosystem conservation, and biodiversity protection through its diverse range of projects, technical assistance programs, and capacity-building initiatives. By leveraging its extensive experience, expertise, and partnerships, JICA will continue to contribute to the global effort to safeguard our planet's precious terrestrial ecosystems and ensure a sustainable future for all.
