Here is a draft long academic article about SDG 15 (Life on Land) as if written by renowned Indian journalist and writer Bachi Karkaria:

Our Ravaged Land: Safeguarding India's Terrestrial Ecosystems

By Bachi Karkaria

India's landscape is a kaleidoscope of biodiversity, from the snow-capped Himalayas to the sun-baked Thar Desert, the rainforests of the Northeast to the mangrove lagoons flanking her coasts. This verdant marvel, intricately woven by nature over millennia, is our ecological inheritance and civilizational anchor. Yet this irreplaceable bequest stands shorn and tattered due to humanity's relentless predations.  

As burgeoning populations encroach on forests and grasslands, our wilderness reserves are enveloped by an ever-tightening human noose. Commercial interests hungering for timber, minerals and real estate deplete our green cover with rapacious impunity. Climate change delivers a cascading payload – intensified droughts, more erratic monsoons, rising sea levels swallowing coastal habitats. Left unchecked, this profligate onslaught could render our terrestrial ecosystems barren and lifeless in a few generations.  

Such dire peril impelled the United Nations to include conservation and sustainable management of land-based ecosystems among its 17 Sustainable Development Goals. SDG 15 - Life on Land aims to "protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."

For India, the stakes could not be higher. Our subcontinent harbors 8.58% of global biodiversity concentrated in just 2.4% of the global land area, including 89,000 animal species and 47,000 plant species. Iconic megafauna like tigers, elephants and leopards make their last stand in our dwindling forests and grasslands. Indigenous communities like the Jarawa, Onge and Sentinelese retain an ancient kinship with the land, living off its sustenance.    

This immense ecological patrimony is rapidly dissipating. Deforestation devours 135,000 hectares annually. Overgrazing and excessive foresting strip topsoils bare in the desert fringes. The proliferation of invasive alien species like lantana, parthenium and water hyacinth chokes out native foliage. Poaching has exterminated numerous species, from the Javan rhinoceros to India's pink-headed duck. Pollution toxifies soils, waterbodies and wetlands.  

While the Forest Conservation Act has slowed deforestation in recent decades, enforcement often flounders due to corruption, insufficient oversight, conflicts with mining and developmental projects, and lack of political will. Existing wildlife sanctuaries and national parks are small oases besieged from all sides by encroachment, degradation and insensitive industrialization.    

India has committed to restoring 26 million hectares of degraded land by 2030 and sequestering 3 billion tons of CO2. It pledges to unlock an additional $200 billion for augmenting green cover and combating desertification and land erosion. Government initiatives like the Green India Mission and Soil Health Card scheme attempt to bolster ecological rejuvenation.  

Yet such efforts remain too piecemeal and fragmented across India's vast territory. Conflicting development agendas paralyze sustained action. Many policies exist only on paper, falling victim to indifference, bureaucratic inertia and political chicanery.   

We stand at a crossroads. One path condemns us to a dystopian moonscape where our progeny wander a barren, desolate wasteland. The other redeems our ecological trusteeship, restoring nature's wonders for future custodians.  

Rising pollution, industrial toxicity and climate change do irreparable injury not just to terrestrial ecosystems, but our very survival as a species. The answers will not arrive from tinkering incrementally or bureaucratic diktats. We need a fundamental reawakening of our ethos – a shift from ravenous exploitation of nature's bounty to judicious husbandry as planetary trustees.   

Indian civilization reveres nature as Bharat Mata, the nurturing Mother Goddess. Her forests were traditionally designated not just as reserves of timber, but sanctuaries of spiritual sustenance - aranyani or vanhins - where rishis and munis retreated to attain life's higher meaning. We may yet reclaim this heritage, reimagining development that harmonizes with ecological prudence rather than erasing nature altogether.   

It requires overcoming centuries of fatalism, torpor and oppression that depleted our civilizational pride. As India's economic resurgence fuels aspirations for a bigger global role, it also kindles hopes for ecological renewal. Our youth harbor a growing environmental consciousness waiting to energize action on the ground. Disparate civil society efforts forge a grassroots green awakening that could yet catalyze policy momentum at higher echelons.   

SDG 15 outlines a crucial planetary report card. But its true potential transcends audits, action plans and benchmarks. It distills the essence of our civilizational continuum - whether we reclaim our tradition of ecological stewardship or yield to the profanities of unbridled greed and plunder. The choice is ours. Future generations will judge us harshly should we mortgage their inheritance by ravaging this land which nurtures us still.
