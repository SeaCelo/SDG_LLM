Street Kids International, a leading non-profit organization dedicated to empowering and protecting the rights of children in precarious situations, presents a comprehensive analysis of the current state of Sustainable Development Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation.

The global water crisis remains a pressing challenge, with an estimated 2.2 billion people lacking access to safely managed drinking water services, and 3.6 billion lacking access to safely managed sanitation facilities. This crisis disproportionately impacts marginalized communities, including street-connected children, who are exposed to preventable water-borne diseases, exploitation, and violence due to inadequate access to safe water and sanitation.

In the densely populated urban settlements where many street-connected children reside, the lack of basic water and sanitation infrastructure exacerbates health risks and perpetuates cycles of poverty and vulnerability. Open defecation, a practice still prevalent in many informal settlements, poses grave risks to children's well-being, exposing them to diseases such as cholera, diarrhea, and parasitic infections, which can lead to malnutrition, stunted growth, and cognitive impairment.

Furthermore, the burden of collecting water from distant and often contaminated sources falls disproportionately on girls and young women, limiting their educational and economic opportunities. This gender-based inequity perpetuates intergenerational cycles of marginalization and disempowerment, hindering progress toward gender equality and sustainable development.

While progress has been made in expanding access to improved water sources and sanitation facilities, significant disparities persist between urban and rural areas, as well as between socioeconomic strata. In many developing countries, water and sanitation services are often inadequately maintained, leading to the contamination of water sources and the breakdown of sanitation systems, further compounding the challenges faced by street-connected children.

Addressing these complex challenges requires a multifaceted approach that prioritizes the rights and well-being of marginalized children and their communities. Sustainable solutions must involve community-driven initiatives that promote behavior change, enhance local ownership, and foster long-term maintenance and management of water and sanitation infrastructure.

Innovative technologies, such as decentralized water treatment systems, rainwater harvesting, and low-cost sanitation solutions, can play a crucial role in providing affordable and sustainable access to clean water and sanitation services in informal settlements. However, these solutions must be accompanied by robust capacity-building programs that empower communities to maintain and operate these systems effectively.

Partnerships between governments, non-governmental organizations, private sector entities, and local communities are essential for mobilizing financial resources, technical expertise, and community engagement. Collaborative efforts that prioritize the participation and empowerment of street-connected children and their families can foster sustainable solutions that address their unique needs and vulnerabilities.

Achieving universal access to clean water and sanitation requires a paradigm shift that recognizes water and sanitation as fundamental human rights, rather than commodities. This shift necessitates policy reforms that prioritize equitable access, particularly for marginalized communities, and promote sustainable water resource management practices.

By addressing the water and sanitation crisis through a human rights-based approach, we can not only improve the health and well-being of street-connected children but also contribute to broader societal transformations that promote gender equality, inclusive education, and sustainable economic growth.

Street Kids International remains committed to advocating for the rights of street-connected children and amplifying their voices in the global discourse on water and sanitation. Through collaborative efforts, innovative solutions, and a unwavering commitment to human rights, we can create a more equitable and sustainable future, where every child has access to clean water and adequate sanitation â€“ essential prerequisites for a life of dignity, opportunity, and empowerment.
