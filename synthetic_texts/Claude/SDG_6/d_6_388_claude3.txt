The World Food Programme's ongoing efforts to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 6 – ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all – are multifaceted and rooted in a deep understanding of the intricate nexus between water, food security, and human development. Our approach recognizes that access to safe and affordable drinking water is not only a fundamental human right but also a critical enabler for sustainable agriculture, economic growth, and resilient communities.

In regions grappling with water scarcity and poor sanitation infrastructure, we have witnessed firsthand the devastating impact on food production, nutrition, and public health. Recurring droughts and dwindling water resources have exacerbated food insecurity, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions of sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia. Inadequate access to safe water and sanitation facilities has also contributed to the spread of waterborne diseases, hampering human development and productivity.

To address these challenges, our interventions are guided by a holistic, integrated water resources management approach that emphasizes community-driven solutions, innovative technologies, and robust governance frameworks. We collaborate closely with local governments, civil society organizations, and affected communities to design and implement context-specific strategies that align with their unique socio-economic, cultural, and environmental landscapes.

In water-stressed regions, we have prioritized the deployment of sustainable water harvesting and storage solutions, such as rainwater harvesting systems, subsurface dams, and small-scale irrigation schemes. These interventions not only increase water availability for domestic and agricultural purposes but also enhance climate resilience and food security. For instance, in the Sahel region of Africa, our efforts have focused on rehabilitating and constructing water infrastructure, including boreholes, wells, and small-scale irrigation systems, empowering communities to cultivate drought-resistant crops and diversify their livelihoods.

Recognizing the critical role of sanitation in preventing the spread of diseases and promoting human dignity, we have invested in the construction and rehabilitation of latrines, handwashing facilities, and solid waste management systems. These interventions are coupled with comprehensive hygiene education campaigns, fostering behavior change and promoting sustainable sanitation practices within communities.

Furthermore, we have embraced innovative technologies and partnerships to optimize water resource management and enhance service delivery. For example, in collaboration with private sector partners and research institutions, we have deployed remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) to monitor water resources, identify potential sources, and inform decision-making processes. Additionally, we have supported the development and dissemination of low-cost, locally adaptable water treatment solutions, such as household water filters and solar-powered disinfection systems, ensuring access to safe drinking water in remote and resource-constrained settings.

Recognizing the cross-cutting nature of water challenges, our interventions are closely integrated with our broader food assistance and resilience-building programs. We prioritize water-smart agricultural practices, such as drip irrigation and conservation agriculture, to enhance water productivity and promote sustainable food production. Moreover, our cash-based transfers and livelihood support initiatives empower vulnerable communities to invest in water infrastructure, sanitation facilities, and income-generating activities, fostering self-reliance and long-term resilience.

Underpinning our efforts is a strong emphasis on capacity building, knowledge sharing, and inclusive governance. We collaborate with national and local authorities to strengthen institutional frameworks, develop integrated water resource management plans, and promote stakeholder engagement in decision-making processes. Additionally, we facilitate cross-border cooperation and knowledge exchange, enabling communities and stakeholders to learn from best practices and adapt successful strategies to their local contexts.

As we continue to navigate the complex challenges posed by water scarcity, climate change, and population growth, our commitment to achieving SDG 6 remains unwavering. We recognize that sustainable water and sanitation management is not only crucial for food security and human development but also a prerequisite for achieving the broader Sustainable Development Goals and building a more equitable, resilient, and prosperous world.
