CARE International's Analytical Report on Sustainable Development Goal 6: Ensure Availability and Sustainable Management of Water and Sanitation for All

The global water crisis is a multifaceted challenge that demands immediate attention and concerted action. Despite being a fundamental human right, access to safe water and sanitation remains a distant reality for billions worldwide. CARE recognizes the pivotal role of SDG 6 in addressing this crisis and its intrinsic links to poverty, health, education, and environmental sustainability.

The lack of access to safe water and sanitation disproportionately impacts marginalized communities, particularly women and children in developing regions. In sub-Saharan Africa, over 400 million people lack basic drinking water services, and nearly 700 million lack access to basic sanitation facilities. This crisis exacerbates existing inequalities, perpetuating cycles of poverty, poor health, and missed educational opportunities.

CARE's interventions prioritize community-led approaches, recognizing the unique challenges and cultural contexts of each region. In rural Bangladesh, our WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene) programs have empowered communities to construct and maintain their own water points and sanitation facilities, fostering ownership and sustainability. By engaging local leaders and leveraging indigenous knowledge, we have facilitated behavior change, promoting improved hygiene practices and reducing the burden of water-borne diseases.

Furthermore, CARE recognizes the need for integrated solutions that address the water-food-energy nexus. In drought-prone regions of East Africa, we have implemented climate-smart agriculture techniques and rainwater harvesting systems, enhancing resilience and food security. These initiatives not only ensure access to water for domestic use but also support sustainable livelihoods, mitigating the impacts of climate change and environmental degradation.

However, achieving SDG 6 requires a multisectoral approach that extends beyond CARE's traditional scope. Collaboration with governments, private sector entities, and other stakeholders is crucial to addressing infrastructure gaps, policy barriers, and capacity-building needs. CARE advocates for inclusive and equitable water governance frameworks that prioritize the voices of marginalized communities, particularly women and indigenous groups.

Additionally, we recognize the need for innovative financing mechanisms to bridge the investment gap in water and sanitation infrastructure. Public-private partnerships, blended finance models, and leveraging climate finance present potential opportunities for scaling up sustainable solutions. CARE has been at the forefront of exploring these mechanisms, such as the Water Credit Initiative in Kenya, which combines commercial financing with technical assistance to support water service providers.

Furthermore, CARE emphasizes the importance of data-driven decision-making and evidence-based interventions. Our monitoring and evaluation systems, informed by participatory methods and cutting-edge technologies, enable us to track progress, measure impact, and adapt our strategies accordingly. This data-driven approach not only enhances accountability but also contributes to the broader knowledge base, informing policy decisions and global best practices.

As we approach the 2030 deadline for the SDGs, CARE remains steadfast in its commitment to achieving SDG 6 and ensuring access to water and sanitation for all. Through our community-driven initiatives, advocacy efforts, and strategic partnerships, we strive to address the underlying determinants of water insecurity, empowering communities, and fostering resilience in the face of multifaceted challenges.
