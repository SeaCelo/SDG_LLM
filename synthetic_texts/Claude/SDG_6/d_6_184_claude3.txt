Here is a long academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), written from the perspective of conservative commentator Dennis Prager:

Water has been essential to life since the beginning of Creation. As the Good Book says, "The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters" (Genesis 1:2). Sadly, far too many of God's children still lack access to this most basic necessity in the 21st century.  

The United Nations has made "clean water and sanitation for all" one of its sustainable development goals. While well-intentioned, this agenda betrays a quintessential progressive misunderstanding about the primary sources of poverty.

You see, the root cause of water scarcity is not a lack of global coordination or environmental regulations. It is a lack of basic Judeo-Christian values like personal responsibility, hard work, delayed gratification, and respect for private property rights. Where these values are absent, wherever the Ten Commandments are rejected as the basis for an organized society, human suffering inevitably follows.

Just look at the regions of the world most blighted by water crises â€“ sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, South Asia. These are areas dominated by tribal cultures steeped in pagan traditions and resistance to the modernizing influences of Western civilization. Their values systems simply do not prioritize or even conceptualize stewardship of natural resources for the benefit of all.

Conversely, the great Judeo-Christian nations of the West long ago updated ancient water management practices from the Middle East through dramatic innovations in plumbing, water treatment, waste disposal, and large-scale infrastructure. We pioneered legal systems that defined and protected property rights in water resources. And we applied Enlightenment values like reason, empiricism, and capital to develop water technologies unimaginable to our ancestors. 

Yet according to the UN globalists, the solution is for the West to ship its hard-earned wealth to the same civilizations that still can't properly value and locally manage something as simple as water? This is not just folly - it is destructive.

Money from Western nations will be captured by the ubiquitous toxic combination of tribalism, socialism, and fundamentalist religion that already governs the lives of billions. Local kleptocrats will siphon off international aid money meant for water infrastructure into their own bank accounts. Lack of respect for private property will mean commonly-held wells, pumps, and pipes are abused and neglected. Sharia law and tribal codes hostile to women's rights will obstruct their access to clean water and sanitation.

The only proven solution is for these societies to fully adopt the universal values that made the West prosperous and healthy - values rooted in scriptural tradition. Limited government, economic freedom, protection of property rights, commitment to reason and technological progress. A recognition that cleanliness is not just next to godliness, but a moral imperative as our bodies are "wonderfully made" in God's image.

Instead of enriching the ubiquitous raft of corrupt UN agencies, world bodies, and myopic politicians, the funding should be channeled into Christian outreach groups and reputable non-governmental organizations like Samaritan's Purse. These are the groups actually delivering water solutions on the ground in a sustainable way. While sharing living water that quenches the spiritual thirst of the soul, they are also imparting the essential values of stewardship over physical resources that facilitate long-term solutions to scarcity.

Perhaps the most vexing aspect of this UN goal is its fundamentally anti-human premise. It treats access to clean water and sanitation as a need disconnected from the values that produce the means to provide it. It sees human beings not as generator of solutions through moral behavior and free markets, but just as another mouth to be fed through centralized administration of inherited resources.

Yet water hasn't been lacking on planet Earth - just the right values to properly manage it. The solution to water crises comes not from more government bureaucracy and redistribution schemes, but a renaissance of those transcendent truths that first allowed societies to flourish and quench the thirst of man and beast alike. If we want to achieve water sustainability, it starts with recovering a durable value system based on God's wisdom, not man's arrogance.
