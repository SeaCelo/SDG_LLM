The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) presents a comprehensive analysis of the current status and challenges associated with Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) – Clean Water and Sanitation – with a particular focus on middle-income countries.

Access to safe and affordable drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services remains a critical challenge for many middle-income nations, impeding their economic and social development trajectories. Despite significant progress in recent decades, an alarming number of people in these countries still lack access to basic WASH services, exacerbating health risks, perpetuating poverty cycles, and hindering productivity.

The disparities in WASH access within middle-income countries are stark, with marginalized communities, rural areas, and informal settlements bearing the brunt of the burden. Inadequate infrastructure, insufficient financing, and weak governance structures have hindered the expansion of WASH services to these vulnerable populations, perpetuating inequalities and undermining the principles of inclusivity and sustainability championed by the SDGs.

Moreover, the impact of climate change on water resources has emerged as a significant concern for middle-income countries. Many of these nations are located in regions vulnerable to droughts, floods, and extreme weather events, which can disrupt water supply systems and contaminate water sources. Addressing these climate-induced challenges requires robust adaptation strategies, including investments in water infrastructure resilience, efficient water management practices, and enhanced early warning systems.

Financing remains a critical bottleneck in achieving SDG 6 targets in middle-income countries. While these nations often do not qualify for concessional financing or aid, they frequently lack the fiscal capacity to undertake large-scale WASH infrastructure projects. This funding gap necessitates innovative financing mechanisms, such as public-private partnerships, blended finance models, and leveraging climate finance opportunities.

Furthermore, effective water governance and institutional frameworks are essential for ensuring equitable and sustainable WASH service delivery. Many middle-income countries grapple with fragmented institutional arrangements, weak regulatory environments, and limited capacity for integrated water resources management. Strengthening these governance structures, fostering stakeholder engagement, and promoting transparency and accountability are crucial steps towards achieving SDG 6 targets.

Addressing the WASH challenges in middle-income countries also presents economic opportunities. Investing in WASH infrastructure can catalyze job creation, drive economic growth, and enhance productivity across various sectors, from agriculture to tourism. Additionally, improved WASH services can yield substantial public health benefits, reducing the burden on healthcare systems and bolstering human capital development.

To accelerate progress towards SDG 6, middle-income countries must adopt a holistic and integrated approach that addresses the multifaceted challenges at hand. This entails strengthening institutional and regulatory frameworks, mobilizing innovative financing mechanisms, fostering international cooperation and knowledge-sharing, and prioritizing climate-resilient WASH infrastructure development. Effective monitoring and evaluation systems are also crucial to track progress, identify gaps, and inform evidence-based policymaking.

In conclusion, achieving SDG 6 in middle-income countries requires a concerted effort from governments, international organizations, the private sector, and civil society. By addressing the underlying challenges of water scarcity, inadequate sanitation, and poor hygiene, these nations can unlock significant socioeconomic benefits, promote inclusive growth, and contribute to the broader sustainable development agenda.
