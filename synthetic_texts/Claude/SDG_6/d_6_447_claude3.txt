The global community's pursuit of Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) – ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all – has been a complex and multifaceted journey. Teach For All, a global network of organizations dedicated to expanding educational opportunities, recognizes the intricate interplay between access to clean water, sanitation, and the ability to unlock human potential through quality education.

In our analysis, we underscore the pivotal role of water and sanitation in creating enabling environments for learning and fostering inclusive societies. The lack of access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) facilities in educational settings perpetuates a vicious cycle of poor health, absenteeism, and diminished cognitive development, particularly impacting marginalized communities.

Our global network's on-the-ground experiences underscore the sobering reality that millions of students and teachers still lack access to basic WASH services. In rural areas, where water scarcity and inadequate infrastructure persist, children often bear the burden of fetching water, compromising their attendance and ability to learn. In urban slums, the lack of sanitation facilities poses severe health risks and exacerbates gender disparities, as girls frequently drop out of school due to concerns over safety and menstrual hygiene management.

Teach For All recognizes that achieving SDG 6 is not solely about infrastructure but also about fostering a culture of sustainable water management and behavior change. Our network's innovative approaches involve integrating WASH education into curricula, empowering students as agents of change, and engaging communities in participatory decision-making processes. For instance, our partners in India have implemented "WASH Clubs," where students actively monitor and maintain school WASH facilities, fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility.

Furthermore, we understand that the challenges of water and sanitation intersect with other development goals, such as poverty alleviation, gender equality, and climate action. Our network's holistic approach acknowledges these interconnections and emphasizes the need for cross-sectoral collaboration and coordinated efforts. For example, our partners in East Africa have implemented rainwater harvesting systems in schools, not only addressing water scarcity but also mitigating the impacts of climate change and promoting environmental sustainability.

Teach For All's commitment to SDG 6 extends beyond the classroom walls. We recognize that access to WASH is a fundamental human right, and our network actively advocates for inclusive and equitable policies that prioritize the needs of marginalized communities. Our partners collaborate with local governments, civil society organizations, and private sector stakeholders to drive systemic change and ensure that no one is left behind in the pursuit of universal access to water and sanitation.

As we look towards the 2030 agenda, Teach For All remains steadfast in its commitment to accelerating progress towards SDG 6. Our network's innovative approaches, grounded in context-specific realities and community engagement, offer valuable insights and best practices that can inform global efforts. By leveraging the transformative power of education and empowering future generations, we are not only addressing the immediate challenges of water and sanitation but also laying the foundation for a more sustainable, equitable, and prosperous world.
