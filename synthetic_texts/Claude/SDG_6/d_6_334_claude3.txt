Water scarcity poses an immense global challenge, inextricably linked to sustainable development and human rights. The Mexican Agency for International Development Cooperation (AMEXCID) recognizes the critical importance of addressing SDG 6 – Clean Water and Sanitation – and its intricate connections with other SDGs, including poverty alleviation, food security, health, and environmental sustainability.

Mexico has made notable strides in expanding access to water and sanitation services, yet significant disparities persist, particularly in rural and marginalized communities. The country's arid and semi-arid regions face acute water stress, exacerbated by climate change, population growth, and unsustainable water management practices. Additionally, inadequate wastewater treatment and pollution pose severe threats to water quality and ecosystem health.

AMEXCID's comprehensive approach to SDG 6 encompasses a multi-faceted strategy that integrates technological innovations, policy reforms, capacity building, and cross-sectoral collaboration. Recognizing the transboundary nature of water resources, AMEXCID fosters regional cooperation and knowledge exchange, aligning with international frameworks such as the UNECE Water Convention and the UN-Water Integrated Monitoring Initiative for SDG 6.

One of AMEXCID's flagship initiatives is the promotion of decentralized water treatment and reuse systems, leveraging Mexico's expertise in low-cost, sustainable technologies. These systems not only address water scarcity but also contribute to SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) by reducing freshwater withdrawal and promoting circular economy principles. AMEXCID collaborates with local communities, indigenous groups, and civil society organizations to ensure the adoption and maintenance of these technologies, fostering ownership and self-sufficiency.

To tackle the challenges of water quality and ecosystem degradation, AMEXCID supports the implementation of Nature-based Solutions (NbS), such as constructed wetlands, riparian buffer zones, and watershed restoration projects. These approaches align with SDG 15 (Life on Land) by protecting biodiversity and enhancing ecosystem services, while simultaneously improving water quality and mitigating flood risks. AMEXCID's NbS initiatives prioritize community engagement, traditional ecological knowledge, and the creation of green jobs, contributing to SDGs 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) and 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities).

Recognizing the nexus between water, energy, and food security, AMEXCID promotes integrated resource management practices in agriculture, a sector that accounts for a significant portion of Mexico's water consumption. Through capacity-building programs and policy support, AMEXCID encourages the adoption of water-efficient irrigation techniques, such as drip irrigation and precision agriculture, which not only conserve water but also reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, aligning with SDGs 2 (Zero Hunger) and 13 (Climate Action).

Furthermore, AMEXCID's efforts extend to strengthening water governance frameworks and fostering multi-stakeholder partnerships. By supporting the development of robust monitoring and evaluation systems, AMEXCID enhances data-driven decision-making and accountability, ensuring equitable access to water and sanitation services, as outlined in SDG 6.1 and 6.2. Collaborations with international organizations, private sector entities, and academia facilitate knowledge sharing, technology transfer, and the mobilization of resources, accelerating progress towards SDG 6 and its interconnected goals.

In conclusion, AMEXCID's comprehensive approach to SDG 6 exemplifies the agency's commitment to addressing water challenges through innovative, sustainable, and inclusive solutions. By fostering cross-sectoral synergies, leveraging cutting-edge technologies, and empowering local communities, AMEXCID contributes to the realization of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, ensuring water security for all.
