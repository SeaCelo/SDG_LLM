Save the Children's analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation

The world's water resources are under immense strain, with more than 2 billion people living in countries experiencing high water stress. Access to safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) remains a critical challenge, particularly in developing nations and marginalized communities. This report delves into the complexities surrounding SDG 6, exploring the intersections between water scarcity, poor sanitation, and their profound impacts on children's health, education, and overall well-being.

The burden of water collection disproportionately falls on women and girls, who often walk miles every day to fetch water, exposing them to physical risks and undermining their access to education and economic opportunities. In sub-Saharan Africa alone, it is estimated that women and girls collectively spend 40 billion hours annually collecting water. This perpetuates gender inequalities and hinders progress towards achieving SDG 5: Gender Equality.

Inadequate WASH facilities in schools create significant barriers to education, particularly for adolescent girls. Without proper sanitation infrastructure, girls often drop out of school during menstruation, hampering their educational attainment and future prospects. In areas plagued by water scarcity, schools may lack clean water for drinking or handwashing, increasing the risk of waterborne diseases and absenteeism among students.

The critical nexus between water, sanitation, and health cannot be overstated. Unsafe water and poor sanitation are leading causes of diarrheal diseases, which claim the lives of nearly 800 children under the age of five every day. These preventable diseases also contribute to malnutrition, stunting, and impaired cognitive development, perpetuating cycles of poverty and inequality.

Climate change exacerbates water stress, with prolonged droughts, erratic rainfall patterns, and rising sea levels threatening freshwater resources. Coastal communities, small island nations, and drought-prone regions are particularly vulnerable, facing the risk of displacement and conflict over dwindling water supplies. Addressing water scarcity and improving climate resilience are inextricably linked to achieving SDG 6.

Sustainable water management practices, such as rainwater harvesting, water recycling, and efficient irrigation techniques, offer promising solutions. However, their implementation requires significant investment, technical expertise, and community engagement. Innovative financing mechanisms, public-private partnerships, and capacity-building initiatives are crucial to scaling up these efforts.

Ensuring universal access to safe and affordable drinking water and adequate sanitation services by 2030 requires a multi-faceted approach. It necessitates strengthening institutional frameworks, enhancing governance mechanisms, and fostering cross-sectoral collaboration between stakeholders, including governments, civil society organizations, private sector entities, and local communities.

Empowering communities through participatory approaches and promoting behavior change are fundamental to achieving lasting improvements in WASH practices. Education and awareness campaigns can foster a sense of ownership and encourage sustainable water management practices at the grassroots level.

Ultimately, achieving SDG 6 is not merely about providing infrastructure; it is about safeguarding human rights, promoting gender equality, and ensuring the health and well-being of children and their communities. By addressing water and sanitation challenges, we lay the foundation for progress across multiple SDGs, creating a ripple effect that transcends borders and generations.
