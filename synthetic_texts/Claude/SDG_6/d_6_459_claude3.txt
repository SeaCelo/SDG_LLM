A Turbulent Journey Towards Water Security

By Neela Ahmad, Environmental Correspondent  

The great watercourses of the world have cradled civilizations since the dawn of humanity. Rivers like the Nile, Indus, and Yangtze provided the lifeblood that enabled cities and agriculture to flourish. But our relationship with this precious resource has become increasingly strained and unsustainable in the modern era.

Global water demand has been surging at more than twice the rate of population growth over the last century. Industry, agriculture, and burgeoning urban centers are locked in an unrelenting competition for finite freshwater supplies. According to the United Nations, water scarcity already affects 40% of the global population, and that number is projected to rise. By 2030, an estimated 700 million people could be displaced by intense water scarcity.  

The crisis isn't just about shortages, however. Contaminated water is an even greater threat, killing more people annually than all forms of violence combined – including wars. Driven by industrial effluents, untreated sewage, agricultural runoff, and other pollutants, poor water quality jeopardizes human health, ecosystems, and economic development on a vast scale.

Bringing Water Security Into Focus

In 2015, the UN Sustainable Development Goals elevated water and sanitation to a top-tier global priority under SDG 6. The goal aims to "ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all" by 2030. While ambitious, water experts say this target is critical for addressing the environmental and social catastrophe that looms without dramatic interventions.

SDG 6 tackles multiple interconnected challenges, from aging infrastructure and inefficient use to environmental degradation. Key components include:

- Achieving universal access to safe and affordable drinking water, ending open defecation, and providing adequate sanitation and hygiene for all. Currently, 2 billion people lack basic sanitation services. 
- Improving water quality by preventing pollution, minimizing release of hazardous chemicals, and increasing recycling and safe reuse globally. Some 80% of wastewater is discharged untreated into waterways.
- Substantially increasing water-use efficiency across sectors and ensuring sustainable freshwater withdrawals to protect water supplies.
- Implementing integrated water resource management at all levels, including through transboundary cooperation on shared water resources.
- Protecting and restoring water-related ecosystems like forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes.

Finding the Water Solutions of Tomorrow

While the challenges are daunting, the SDGs have galvanized action and investment around novel approaches to water sustainability. "We have to get more strategic about balancing water supply and demand through conservation, reuse, desalination and other measures," says Marianne Beisheim of SWP Research Division.

From water funds that invest in upstream conservation to wastewater recycling and atmospheric water harvesting, innovative solutions are being piloted globally. Promising technologies like forward osmosis, biomimetic membranes and solar disinfection could help make treatment more affordable and energy-efficient.  

On the governance side, there's a growing emphasis on policies that incentivize water stewardship, like decentralized water management, data-driven water accounting and risk mitigation. Cape Town's "Day Zero" drought was averted through aggressive conservation efforts like restrictions, leakage repairs and diversifying supplies.  

"We need to start valuing water for what it truly is – the most vital resource on Earth," says Beisheim. "With smart planning and the right investments, we can prevent water crises from becoming tomorrow's global security nightmare."

The Road Ahead
 
More than halfway to the 2030 deadline, progress on SDG 6 has been alarmingly slow. The COVID-19 pandemic further set back water access and sanitation efforts. But climate change is increasingly seen as the central threat that could unravel water security in many regions. Higher temperatures, erratic rainfall, rising seas and melting glaciers will exacerbate shortages while flooding and pollution jeopardize water safety.

To meet the spiraling challenges, annual investment in water infrastructure needs to triple to $114 billion per year, according to the World Bank. But funding remains grossly inadequate – and unevenly distributed. "If you look at where clean water investments are flowing, it's largely to wealthier nations that can pay, while the poorest bear the brunt of shortages and disease," notes Beisheim. "Without a globalized effort, the goals won't be met."

As countries grapple with rising resource insecurity, the grand challenge of water cuts across issues like food and energy production, public health, economic development and ecological resilience. With so much riding on our stewardship of this irreplaceable resource, the world can ill afford for SDG 6 to go down the drain.
