Here is a draft academic article on SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) as if written by renowned op-ed columnist Maureen Dowd:

The Thirst for Dignity

By Maureen Dowd  

The world is drifting perilously close to a parched dystopia where the rich stay hydrated with purified waters from boutique glaciers while the poor drink ditch water and disease festers. As the sinister twin forces of climate change and unchecked greed conspire to turn water into a scarce commodity for the have-nots, the international community's halting progress on the U.N.'s Sustainable Development Goal #6 - ensuring access to clean water and sanitation for all by 2030 - is being revealed as a cosmetic cover-up from the bad old days of colonialism.  

When I visited a Mumbai slum swarming with babies defecating in the open because their mothers had no toilet, I witnessed the raw indignity of a world awash in water being stripped from the poor by the arrogance of corruption and neglect. In the age of accumulating superstorms, megadroughts and mass displacement of climate refugees, the lack of clean water and sanitation - this most basic building block to human health and habitation - has emerged as both a festering humanitarian crisis and an existential security threat.

Denying people clean water and ways to properly dispose of bodily waste has always been a cruel mechanism of oppression - from British colonialists salting the soil to American settlers poisoning Native American wells to modern-day warlords wielding water cutoffs as a weapon to subjugate civilians. Access to clean water has become the privilege of the privileged, available only to those with means to ferry it cross-continental distances or filter out industrial toxins and agricultural runoffs.

But virulent pathogens, toxic algae blooms and carcinogenic industrial chemicals contaminating public water supplies know no class boundaries. Erin Brockovich brought the fight for clean water to the masses, but in today's world entire generations of children sickened by waterborne toxins are washing up on the shores of inequality as another harsh reminder of which lives are disposable.

The solution lies in the liberation of water from corporatists who see this most vital human right as a business opportunity. As some investors pour millions into desalination plants, dam projects and privatized water utilities, others are profiting by staking claims to groundwater, extracting fossil water at unsustainable rates and depleting aquifers that took millennia to fill. Unless wealthy nations awaken to this new colonialism, the gulf between the hydrated overlords and the thirsty underclass will widen into an uncrossable chasm.

Some argue that what's needed is a massive effort to install sustainable sewage and septic systems. But how does that help the millions of refugees with no permanent home? Others embrace water purification gadgets and apps that can locate clean sources. But that ignores those millions too poor to afford luxuries. We mustn't let Silicon Valley's knack for ingenuity blind us to the root issues of inequality that enable water scarcity in the first place.

Our house is on fire, and the children being burned first are those living in the parched slums without access to clean water and sanitation. The burning injustice sears. An entire global underclass is being denied its basic human birthright - these precious liquid assets upon which all life and dignity depends. Resolving this moral stain on our species' soul will require a radical rethinking of water ownership and a new ethics of sharing the vital flow equitably.

What the world needs is a fierce movement akin to Greta Thunberg's - a louder megaphone giving voice to the thirst of the dispossessed in a world going increasingly dry. A grassroots revolution demanding local communities build and control water resources. Wealthy nations investing in ways to capture and reuse water while closing the piping and sewage gaps for the poor. A new global framework that declares the human right to water sacrosanct, never again to be poisoned by privilege or beset by profit motive.

Nelson Mandela called the struggle for water "the source of natural and human resources for survival and progress." We ignore that struggle at our mortal peril. Because in the end, some droplets of wisdom: As water scarcity spreads across the planet, those who have been drought-shamed may one day realize they have gone too far down the road of excessive thirst. Will they then listen to the parched millions gasping for the most basic element of dignified life? It's a watershed moment for us all.
