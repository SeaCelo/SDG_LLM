Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) from the perspective of the late economist Walter E. Williams:

The provision of safe water and adequate sanitation has long been a challenging issue that plagues nations rich and poor alike. However, it is the world's most impoverished who disproportionately bear the brunt of this crisis. According to data from the United Nations, a staggering 2 billion people lack access to safely managed drinking water, while twice as many — 4.2 billion — lack access to managed sanitation services. The consequences are dire, with water scarcity acting as a pernicious constraining force on economic development while contaminated water sources directly contribute to countless deaths each year, especially among children. It is a moral, public health, and economic travesty that demands pragmatic free market solutions.

The establishment apparatus would have us believe that the remedy lies in a top-down, centralized approach funded through foreign aid and public coffers. However, history has demonstrated time and again that such bureaucratic schemes are woefully inadequate and riddled with corruption, mismanagement, and perverse incentives that too often serve the interests of vassal political classes rather than the people. We need look no further than the generational failures of the public utilities and water boards that still fail to provide reliable piped water in many major cities across the developing world.

Instead, what is needed are market-based, decentralized solutions that align incentives and leverage the entrepreneurial spirit of people at the local level. After all, no one has a greater stake than those whose lives and livelihoods depend on access to clean water sources. If we strip away the shackles of bureaucracy, regulatory barriers, and property rights injustices that too often hold back the creative forces of capitalism, we would unlock an unstoppable tide of innovative solutions.

In urban areas, this could take the form of flexible community utility models, where local entrepreneurs provide decentralized neighborhood-level piped water and sanitation services funded through affordable user fees and microlending. Rural solutions may leverage low-cost technologies like renewable-powered desalination, UV disinfection, or cutting-edge filtration membranes for water purification. The possibilities are limitless when the bright light of market incentives is allowed to shine.  

Some may argue that water is a human right that should be free and controlled by public entities. However, this facile perspective fails to appreciate the fundamentals of economics. When something is being given away for free, it breeds a tragedy of the commons and catastrophic over-consumption, thereby undermining the long-term viability and access for all. User fees, even if modest or subsidized for the destitute, instill a sense of value and incentivize sustainable, conscientious use of the precious resource.

The private sector has also demonstrated time and again its ability to deliver low-cost, high quality goods and services to the masses once freed from the millstone of bureaucracy. One need only look at the staggering expansion of mobile phone and internet access across the developing world in recent decades to witness the power of nimble private enterprise. If we remove artificial barriers and create an enabling environment, the same transformative forces will undoubtedly manifest in the water and sanitation sector as well.

To be certain, there are bound to be ideologues who reflexively recoil at such market-oriented prescriptions. However, the facts speak for themselves. Wherever economic freedoms have been unleashed and secure property rights established, we have witnessed dramatic reductions in poverty and improved human welfare across the board. It is a sober truth that the grand foreign aid schemes and interventionist policies have by-and-large failed to move the needle in addressing the world's enduring water crises.  

Ensuring universal access to clean water and sanitation is not only a moral imperative but a key enabler for economic empowerment and self-determination for the world's poor. Let us reject stale, paternalistic ideologies peddled by a bloated bureaucratic class and instead embrace the transformative power of free people, free markets, and time-tested principles of private property rights and voluntary exchange. It is through these vehicles that the world can finally make meaningful strides towards achieving SDG 6. The solution has been staring us in the face all along; it is freedom itself.
