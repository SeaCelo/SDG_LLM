As the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, I am compelled to shed light on the profound implications of Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) – Clean Water and Sanitation – for the global refugee crisis. Access to safe and affordable drinking water, sanitation facilities, and hygiene services is a fundamental human right, yet it remains a daunting challenge for millions of displaced individuals worldwide.

The nexus between water scarcity, inadequate sanitation, and forced displacement is a vicious cycle that perpetuates human suffering and exacerbates existing vulnerabilities. Conflicts over scarce water resources have long been a driving force behind displacement, with communities being uprooted from their homes due to water-related violence, environmental degradation, and the impacts of climate change. In regions like the Sahel, the Middle East, and Central Asia, water stress has contributed to the displacement of millions, further straining already limited resources in host communities.

Within refugee camps and informal settlements, the lack of access to clean water and sanitation facilities poses grave risks to public health and human dignity. Overcrowded living conditions, poor infrastructure, and limited resources create breeding grounds for water-borne diseases such as cholera, dysentery, and hepatitis. Women and girls, in particular, face heightened risks of gender-based violence when forced to trek long distances or wait in unsafe areas to collect water or access sanitation facilities.

The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the water and sanitation crisis in refugee settings, underscoring the critical importance of handwashing and hygiene practices in preventing the spread of infectious diseases. Many refugee camps lack sufficient water supply and soap, rendering the most basic preventive measures a luxury for those already struggling to survive.

However, addressing the water and sanitation needs of refugees is not merely a matter of humanitarian aid; it is a strategic imperative for fostering sustainable development, peace, and stability. Water scarcity and poor sanitation can act as catalysts for social unrest, conflict, and further displacement, creating a vicious cycle that undermines efforts to achieve the SDGs.

To break this cycle, a multi-pronged approach is necessary, one that integrates water resource management, conflict resolution, and sustainable development strategies. Innovative solutions such as solar-powered water purification systems, rainwater harvesting, and decentralized wastewater treatment facilities can help alleviate water stress in refugee settlements while promoting environmental sustainability.

Furthermore, effective water diplomacy and transboundary water management mechanisms are crucial for preventing and resolving water-related conflicts, ensuring equitable access to shared water resources, and promoting regional stability. By addressing the root causes of water scarcity and displacement, we can pave the way for durable solutions and sustainable reintegration of refugees into their communities of origin.

Achieving SDG 6 is not only a moral imperative but also a strategic necessity for addressing the global refugee crisis. By ensuring access to clean water and sanitation for all, we can safeguard human dignity, promote public health, and lay the foundations for lasting peace and sustainable development. It is a call to action that demands a collective and concerted effort from governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector, recognizing that water is a universal human right and a catalyst for transformative change.
