Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) as if written by Thomas Friedman:

The Next Big Thing Is...Clean Water and Sanitation?  

You're darn right it is. I know, I know - it doesn't have quite the same whiz-bang as AI, blockchain, or the metaverse. But hear me out. Because if we can't get our arms around providing clean water and sanitation for all, then nothing else is going to matter much in the long run. This is the indispensable resource and foundation that everything else is built upon. It is the prerequisite for human health, economic development, gender equality, climate resilience, and sustaining life itself.

Let me illustrate with an example: I recently visited a village in rural Kenya where women and girls spend up to six hours each day walking to fetch water from sources that are often contaminated. Think about that - up to a quarter of their entire lives devoted just to securing something most of us simply turn a tap to receive. The health impacts are staggering, with waterbornediseases like cholera killing hundreds of thousands annually. But it gets worse - the lack of sanitation means even their modest efforts for water are constantly re-contaminated. It's a vicious cycle trapping generations in poverty, skyrocketing health care costs, depressing educational opportunities, and curtailing economic productivity.

Now consider that on a global scale: more than 2 billion people lack access to safely managed drinking water, while twice that number don't have basic sanitation services like toilets. The numbers are rising due to factors like rapid urbanization, conflict, climate change and environmental degradation. And it's the world's poorest and most marginalized communities who disproportionately shoulder this burden.

What if I told you that $1 invested in water and sanitation yields a $5-$28 economic return through increased productivity and reduced health costs? Or that better sanitation has been shown to dramatically increase school attendance - especially for girls once proper facilities are available? Wouldn't you call that a great investment and an absolute game-changer for advancing human development?

Yet funding in this area has long been inadequate and fragmented. Too often it gets siloed as a niche "development" issue when it is really the mother of all human development and environmental challenges. Want to spur economic growth? Provide clean water. Want to reduce conflict and promote regional stability? Secure access to sanitation. Want to build resilience to climate shocks? Improve water resource management. It is the thread that connects so many of the world's hairiest knots and unlocks solutions across multiple sectors.

Thankfully, the global community is waking up to the centrality of SDG 6 and its catalytic role. The private sector is increasingly recognizing water risk and taking action to value and conserve this precious resource across their operations and supply chains. We're seeing more blended finance instruments unlocking funding for transformative water infrastructure and innovative service delivery models. Public-private partnerships are exploring ways to simultaneously localize and scale sanitation solutions for burgeoning urban areas.

But we need a quantum leap beyond the piecemeal approach that has plagued the sector for too long. We need to capitalize on digital technologies for monitoring, pricing mechanisms that incentivize conservation, and a systems-level rethinking of how we manage the entire water cycle. A new green revolution for the blue economy if you will. One with water and sanitation firmly embedded at its core as the enablers for achieving all the other SDGs and ensuring human flourishing.

So while virtual worlds and cryptocurrencies will grab the headlines, keep your eyes on SDG 6 - because while perhaps less sexy on the surface, there has never been a more mission-critical undertaking for safeguarding our collective future on this planet. Those providing solutions for clean water and sanitation access may soon be the new disruptors and innovators shaping our world. Now that's something worth investing in.
