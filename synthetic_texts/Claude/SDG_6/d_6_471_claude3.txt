Here is a long newspaper article about Sustainable Development Goal 6 on clean water and sanitation, written from the perspective of Forbes magazine:

The Next Big Thing In Sustainability Is Liquid Gold

By 2025, half of the world's population will be living in water-stressed areas. But this crisis for humanity represents an untapped market opportunity for the private sector worth tens of billions annually. Those acting now to secure sustainable freshwater supplies have the potential to reap massive profits while driving positive global impact.

"Water scarcity is one of the defining crises of our time, with far-reaching consequences for health, food production, energy generation, and more," says Dr. David Zhang, Director of the Water Global Practice at the World Bank. "But within this challenge lies incredible investment potential for those companies willing to innovate sustainable solutions."

Water has long been drastically undervalued as a resource. Subsidies, poor infrastructure, and lack of proper pricing mechanisms have allowed this precious commodity to be wasted on an epic scale. In the agricultural sector alone, up to 60% of water drawn goes unproductively lost due to leaky irrigation systems, inefficient applications, and other preventable issues.

According to the United Nations, the investment required to meet the rapidly increasing global demand for water and sanitation services is at least $6.7 trillion by 2030. However, current investment in water infrastructure is only a fraction of this amount.

This funding gap represents a prime prospect for private capital inflows. Leading investors and financial institutions are now waking up to water's investment potential, with new funds and asset classes emerging to profit from sustainable water management.

"There's no question that water will be one of the most crucial assets of the 21st century, and we're already seeing early players making moves to gain control over supplies and infrastructure," remarks Sofia Fenili, Chief Investment Officer at the $265 billion private equity firm Vision Aqua Capital. "Those who recognise water's value and move aggressively to secure intelligent water positions globally will be the ones writing the rulebook going forward."

Already, leading multinationals like Nestl√©, Anheuser-Busch, and Coca-Cola have made multibillion-dollar investments to audit their water footprints, increase efficiency, and pursue sustainable sourcing strategies for their operations. Agriculture giants like Bayer and Olam are investing heavily in precision irrigation technologies. Desalination and water recycling firms like IDE Technologies and Xylem have seen sales boom as water-stressed countries urgently seek to increase their potable water supplies.

However, perhaps the largest fortunes of the coming decades will be made by those companies at the forefront of financing and operating water infrastructure itself. multinational water corporations like Veolia and Suez already generate tens of billions annually through their global concessions and water utility operations.

"Public-private partnerships will be key for solving the water crisis facing both the developed and developing worlds," says Alain Franchi, president of operations for Veolia Water Americas. "Major private water operators like us have the capital, expertise, and technologies to upgrade antiquated systems and properly manage and value water resources over the long-term."

Innovative financing models like water funds, green bonds, and impact investment vehicles are mobilising private money into water infrastructure at an accelerating rate. The multi-billion dollar AQUA fund managed by Goldman Sachs generates returns for investors by taking equity stakes in water utilities and treatment facilities. The European Investment Bank has issued over $11 billion in water project green bonds.

Technological advances are also unlocking new revenue streams in the water sector. Blackrock recently led a $58 million funding round for ASTERRA, an Israeli satellite imaging analytics firm that detects leaks and efficiency lapses in water utility systems. Cloud-based digital solutions like those offered by Verizon and IBM allow utilities and industrial users to transform their water management through machine learning and the internet of things.

While the private sector is still in the relatively early innings of water investment, the market opportunity is staggering. The global water and wastewater treatment equipment market alone is projected to surpass $90 billion by 2025. Sustainable freshwater supply has been recognised as an essential component of business continuity by corporate giants, and a literal lifeline for municipalities and billions of households worldwide.

"The economics of water are becoming impossible to ignore," says William Sarni, water strategy director with the investment firm Brigad and author of Water Tech: A Guide to Innovation. "By treating it as the precious resource it is rather than an infinitely abundant free good, we're finally beginning to value water at a level that reflects its true worth to humanity's survival and the sustainable growth of the global economy."

Those willing to lead the charge in water innovation and reap the immense profits from achieving U.N. Sustainable Development Goal 6 won't just be securing their bottom lines. They'll be securing a better future for us all.
