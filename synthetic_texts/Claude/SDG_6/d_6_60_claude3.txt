Here is a fictional academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), written from the perspective of the late satirist and essayist Russell Baker:

The Indispensable Stream: Reflections on SDG 6

By Russell Baker

They say that whiskey is for drinking and water is for fighting over. Looking around at the state of the world's freshwater supplies, it's hard not to think they've got a point. From the aqua nullius of the high seas to the day-zero droughts turning formerly moist climes into desiccated moonscapes, it seems we humans have an impressive talent for fouling the very lifeblood that flows through our veins—and our society.

Of course, the United Nations has seen fit to make a solemn global commitment through Sustainable Development Goal 6: that by 2030 we shall "ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all." A noble aim no doubt, but one looks askance at these lofty pronouncements. Have the diplomats never visited the great rivers of the world, those open septic lines masquerading as freshwater sources? Or peered too closely at the rural communities whose inhabitants must carry home undrunk what precious little monstre sacré remains?

One fears the "sustainable management" clause may be honored more in the breach than the observance. For while bickering over that Indispensable Stream which nourishes every terrestrial plant and creature, we have polluted with our prosperity, poisoned by our profligacy, and partitioned by our petty feuding over who shall drink and who shall thirst.

Some bright-eyed souls point to technological salvation—desalination plants, nanofilters, catch-and-release dams, what have you. Yet each innovation merely kicks the ecological can down the road. For the root problem remains: there exists no substitute for clean, potable, life-giving water, and we spew forth a relentless torrent of waste that must go somewhere. Until we rein in the sources of contamination, the dwindling aquatic bounty of this blue planet shall be forever under siege.

Others assign hope in top-down interventions: transnational accords, government sanitation initiatives, public-private partnerships. These too are well and good, but often sputter out in a morass of political cronyism, bureaucratic torpor, corporate greed, and all the other perennial human frailties that derail even the most perspicacious plans. For water scarcity creeps in everywhere the instant those in power take their eye off the prize.

Perhaps the most earnest reformers focus on grassroots empowerment, from teaching riverside communities how to filter their own supplies to curbing industrial runoff and agricultural contamination at the local level. A hopeful path, but one which still feels piecemeal and lacking in comprehensive vision. How to harmonize these countless scattered actors towards a unified goal?

My own view is that we need a profound reframing of our relationship to water—to see it not as an endless facet of nature to be carelessly consumed, but as the fragile lifeblood of everything around us, to be fiercely protected from harm. We need both a spiritual and cultural awakening towards stewardship of our most precious renewable resource. Only then might we cease taking H2O for granted and start treating it as what it truly is: the source of every drop of life, to be swaddled and cherished by all.

This awakening is necessary but not sufficient. It must be joined with a sober reckoning of our collective impacts on the hydrologic cycle—a full-cost accounting of everything from carbon emissions to overbuilding coastlines to wanton waste of freshwater stores. We need data-driven policymaking and public education campaigns to illuminate the many threats facing our liquid assets.

Finally, we shall require an unprecedented degree of global cooperation and coordination—a harmonization of laws, regulations, and preventative frameworks to secure inviolable stewardship of water across borders, watersheds, and ecosystems. An enormously complex undertaking, to be sure, but one that underscores the central role of SDG 6 as not merely a technical target but a keystone goal essential to achieving every other priority around it. For without widespread access to safe water, how can we combat disease, feed growing populations, power economies, or maintain social stability?

Much work remains to be done, so many streams yet to be uncrossed. But in tackling SDG 6, we uphold nothing less than the perpetuation of all life on Earth. Here's to hoping humanity heeds the flow of that Indispensable Stream before we reroute it to disaster.
