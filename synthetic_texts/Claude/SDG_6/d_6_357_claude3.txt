The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) recognizes the critical importance of Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) – Clean Water and Sanitation – in promoting sustainable development and improving the quality of life for millions across Asia and beyond. Access to safe and affordable drinking water, adequate sanitation facilities, and sound management of water resources are fundamental human rights and essential drivers of economic growth, social progress, and environmental sustainability.

The AIIB's commitment to SDG 6 is rooted in the understanding that water scarcity and poor sanitation pose severe threats to human health, food security, and economic productivity. In many parts of Asia, rapidly growing populations, urbanization, and industrialization have placed immense pressure on already strained water resources. Climate change has further exacerbated the challenges, leading to more frequent and severe droughts, floods, and water quality deterioration.

To address these pressing issues, the AIIB has adopted a multi-pronged approach that encompasses infrastructure development, policy reforms, capacity building, and cross-sectoral collaboration. Our investment portfolio prioritizes projects that improve access to clean water and sanitation services, particularly in rural and marginalized communities. This includes the construction and rehabilitation of water supply systems, desalination plants, wastewater treatment facilities, and sewerage networks.

Recognizing the interconnectedness of water with other sectors, the AIIB also supports projects that promote integrated water resource management (IWRM). This holistic approach considers the entire water cycle, from source to discharge, and seeks to balance the competing demands for water from various sectors, such as agriculture, industry, and urban development. By promoting IWRM, we aim to enhance water use efficiency, mitigate water-related disasters, and protect aquatic ecosystems.

Furthermore, the AIIB places a strong emphasis on strengthening institutional and regulatory frameworks for water governance. We work closely with member countries to develop and implement robust policies, laws, and regulations that promote sustainable water management practices. This includes measures to address issues such as groundwater overexploitation, water pollution, and inefficient water pricing mechanisms.

Capacity building and knowledge sharing are integral components of our efforts. The AIIB supports technical assistance programs and knowledge partnerships that enhance the skills and expertise of water professionals, policymakers, and local communities. These initiatives cover a wide range of topics, including water resource planning, climate resilience, wastewater treatment technologies, and community-led water management approaches.

In our pursuit of SDG 6, the AIIB recognizes the importance of cross-sectoral collaboration and partnerships. We actively engage with various stakeholders, including governments, civil society organizations, private sector entities, and international organizations, to leverage collective expertise and resources. By fostering collaboration, we aim to promote integrated solutions that address the complex challenges of water security and sanitation.

The AIIB's commitment to SDG 6 is underpinned by a strong emphasis on sustainability, innovation, and social inclusiveness. We prioritize projects that incorporate environmentally sound technologies, promote circular economy principles, and foster public-private partnerships. Additionally, we actively promote gender equality and the empowerment of marginalized communities in our water and sanitation initiatives, recognizing their vital role in achieving sustainable and equitable outcomes.

In conclusion, the AIIB's comprehensive approach to addressing SDG 6 reflects our unwavering commitment to promoting sustainable development and improving the lives of people across Asia and beyond. Through strategic investments, policy support, capacity building, and collaborative efforts, we strive to ensure access to clean water and sanitation for all, while safeguarding precious water resources for future generations.
