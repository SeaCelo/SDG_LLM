The world is facing unprecedented challenges in ensuring access to clean water and sanitation for all, a foundational goal enshrined in the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). As a renowned economist and director of the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics, I find the intersections between water security, economic growth, and sustainable development particularly compelling.

Water is a fundamental input for virtually every economic activity, from agriculture and industry to energy production and household consumption. Yet, according to the World Health Organization, one in three people globally lacks access to safe drinking water, and two out of five lack basic sanitation services. This crisis disproportionately affects the world's poorest and most vulnerable populations, perpetuating cycles of poverty, poor health, and diminished economic opportunities.

The economic consequences of inadequate water and sanitation are staggering. Lack of access to safe water and sanitation is estimated to cost the global economy approximately $260 billion annually due to lost productivity, healthcare costs, and labor diversions. Moreover, water scarcity poses a significant threat to economic growth, particularly in regions already grappling with water stress, such as parts of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia.

Addressing SDG 6 requires a multi-faceted approach that recognizes the intrinsic links between water, sanitation, and various aspects of sustainable development. From an economic perspective, investments in water and sanitation infrastructure can yield substantial returns by improving public health, boosting productivity, and unlocking new economic opportunities.

For instance, studies have shown that every dollar invested in water and sanitation can yield economic returns ranging from $3 to $34, depending on the region and context. These benefits stem from reduced healthcare costs, increased school attendance (particularly for girls), and improved labor force participation. Furthermore, reliable access to water and sanitation can catalyze economic growth by enabling the development of water-intensive industries, such as manufacturing and agriculture.

However, achieving SDG 6 requires more than just financial investments; it necessitates a paradigm shift in how we value and manage water resources. Economic instruments, such as water pricing mechanisms, can incentivize sustainable water use and encourage conservation efforts. Additionally, public-private partnerships can leverage private sector expertise and resources to enhance water and sanitation service delivery, particularly in urban areas.

Moreover, addressing water scarcity and sanitation challenges requires a holistic approach that considers the interplay between water, energy, and food systems. For example, the production of biofuels, while potentially contributing to energy security, can exacerbate water stress in certain regions. Conversely, improving water efficiency in agriculture can reduce the sector's substantial water footprint while enhancing food security.

SDG 6 also highlights the importance of transboundary cooperation in managing shared water resources, particularly in regions with competing water demands or conflicts over access. Economic analyses can inform the development of equitable and mutually beneficial water-sharing agreements, fostering regional stability and economic integration.

Ultimately, achieving SDG 6 is not only a moral imperative but also an economic necessity. By investing in water and sanitation infrastructure, promoting sustainable water management practices, and fostering cross-sectoral and transboundary cooperation, we can unlock tremendous economic potential while safeguarding the well-being of current and future generations.
