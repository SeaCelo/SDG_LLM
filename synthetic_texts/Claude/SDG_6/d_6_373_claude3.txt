The International Red Cross presents this detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation, addressing the critical challenges and progress towards ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.

Water scarcity and poor sanitation remain pressing global issues, exacerbated by rapid population growth, industrialization, urbanization, and climate change. Millions still lack access to safely managed drinking water services and basic sanitation facilities, perpetuating a vicious cycle of poverty, disease, and environmental degradation.

In conflict-affected and fragile contexts, water infrastructure is often targeted or collaterally damaged, leaving communities vulnerable to water-borne diseases and economic disruption. The Red Cross has witnessed firsthand the devastating impacts of water scarcity and contamination, particularly on women and children who bear the primary burden of water collection and are most susceptible to water-related illnesses.

Progress has been uneven across regions, with Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia lagging behind. Least developed countries face significant challenges due to limited financial resources, technical capacity, and governance structures. Climate change is exacerbating water stress, with droughts and floods becoming more frequent and severe, threatening agricultural productivity and food security.

However, there have been notable achievements, with the global population using safely managed drinking water services increasing from 61% in 2000 to 71% in 2020. Yet, progress on sanitation has been slower, with only 54% of the global population using safely managed sanitation services in 2020, leaving 2.3 billion people without access to basic sanitation facilities.

Innovative approaches, such as decentralized water treatment systems, rainwater harvesting, and community-led total sanitation, have shown promise in improving access and sustainability. However, scaling up these solutions requires significant investments, capacity building, and policy reforms.

Water resources management remains a critical challenge, with agriculture accounting for 70% of global freshwater withdrawals. Inefficient irrigation practices, coupled with industrial and domestic pollution, are straining water resources and ecosystems. Integrated water resources management, involving stakeholders across sectors and transboundary cooperation, is essential for sustainable and equitable water allocation.

The Red Cross, through its extensive network and community-based approach, plays a pivotal role in promoting water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions. Our initiatives range from emergency water trucking and household water treatment during humanitarian crises to long-term WASH infrastructure development and hygiene promotion programs.

Partnerships with governments, private sector, and civil society organizations are crucial for leveraging resources, expertise, and scale. Innovative financing mechanisms, such as blended finance and results-based contracting, can attract private investments and incentivize sustainable service delivery models.

Achieving SDG 6 requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the root causes of water scarcity and poor sanitation, including governance challenges, population growth, and climate change. Coordinated efforts across sectors, stakeholders, and national boundaries are essential for ensuring universal access to safe water and sanitation while protecting freshwater ecosystems and promoting sustainable water resources management.
