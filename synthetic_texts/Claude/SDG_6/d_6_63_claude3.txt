Here is a detailed academic article about the Sustainable Development Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) from the perspective of Gwynne Dyer, written in his signature style:

Water Wars on the Horizon?

By Gwynne Dyer

Everyone has heard the dire predictions about future "water wars" over dwindling fresh water supplies. The classic scenario involves the downstream country controlling a major river going to war against the upstream countries diverting too much water before it crosses their borders. The Indus waters dispute between India and Pakistan, for example, with two nuclear-armed countries squabbling bitterly over their rights and needs. But will these conflicts ever really happen?

They make great crisis pornography, to be sure. There's nothing that smites the civilized world quite like the prospect of nuclear powers going to war over scarce resources and leaving scorched wastelands behind. But in reality, water wars between nation-states are almost unthinkable, because no amount of force can make more water appear. Conquering your neighbors would gain you little or nothing.

Military force is much better suited to taking things rather than creating them. Rivers and aquifers are relatively easy to foul up, whether accidentally or on purpose, but very hard to fix once they are broken. Besides, a solid majority of the world's major watersheds cross national borders. With so many countries involved, who do you actually go to war against? Taking these facts into account, water wars between nation-states make very little sense.

But how about water wars within nation-states? Now we may be on to something.

Large, pivotal countries like India, China, the United States and others have huge, thirsty populations along with rapidly dropping water tables in many key agricultural areas. Disputes between water-rich and water-poor regions, states or counties are already becoming sharper and more serious. And their armies may eventually get involved if the disputes cannot be resolved politically.

In China, plans for massive diversions of water from the humid south to the parched north via huge canals have aroused great suspicion and anger in the source areas of the south. The Chinese government doesn't seem to care, having both the money and the political power to bull its way past local objections, but disgruntled minorities like the Uighurs and Tibetans may become even more restive as their water gets drained away.

In India, the southern states are farther away from the Himalayan sources and worry about their water supplies being monopolized by the thirsty north. These states are also the wealthiest and most economically powerful in the country, so Delhi cannot simply ignore their concerns. As drought becomes more common, civic resources could be overwhelmed by internal migrations.

The western United States faces a similar bind with wealthier, more populous states downstream on the Colorado River. As the great southwestern megadrought continues to drain reservoirs and irrigation sources, pressure is building between urban and agricultural users, and between the different states themselves.

When things get really tough, the national government will have to step in with military forces to allocate the dwindling waters between states and uses. While open warfare seems unlikely, you can expect to see federal troops guarding dams, pipelines, and canals to enforce the new rules of water allocation. Let's call them food-and-water pacification operations.

So no, full-scale water wars between nation-states are probably not on the horizon any time soon. The environments would be ruined, the economic costs would be crippling, and the real issues would not be solved in any case. But within many large countries, those without a clear internal hierarchy and method for allocating shortages, severe disputes over water could easily get out of hand and turn violent.

That's where the "water wars" are more likely to break out. Not at the borders, but internally - and with the national armies getting dragged into essentially food-and-water riot control. The global rush to save and protect dwindling water supplies will not be a pretty process.
