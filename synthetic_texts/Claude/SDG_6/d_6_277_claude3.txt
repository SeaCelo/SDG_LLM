SDG 6: Ensure Availability and Sustainable Management of Water and Sanitation for All

By Luigi Zingales, Professor of Entrepreneurship and Finance, University of Chicago Booth School of Business

Water is not only the elixir of life but also the lubricant of economic progress. The availability of safe water and sanitation services is a fundamental human right that underpins public health, food security, and economic growth. Yet, according to the United Nations, over 2 billion people worldwide lack access to safe drinking water, and 3.6 billion lack access to adequate sanitation facilities. This deprivation perpetuates a vicious cycle of poverty, disease, and stunted development, disproportionately affecting marginalized communities and exacerbating inequalities.

The Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) aims to disrupt this cycle by ensuring universal access to water and sanitation by 2030. However, achieving this goal requires a paradigm shift in how we perceive, value, and manage this invaluable resource. We must transition from a linear, extractive model of water usage to a circular, regenerative approach that prioritizes sustainability, efficiency, and equitable distribution.

At the heart of this challenge lies a fundamental economic paradox: water is a precious, life-sustaining commodity, yet it is often treated as a free or undervalued resource. This market failure stems from the lack of well-defined property rights and the persistent underpricing of water, which incentivizes overexploitation and inefficient allocation. To address this, we must reframe water as a valuable economic asset and implement market-based mechanisms that incentivize conservation, efficient usage, and investment in water infrastructure.

One promising solution lies in the adoption of water pricing mechanisms that accurately reflect the scarcity and opportunity costs of water. By implementing tiered pricing structures, we can promote conservation among high-volume users while ensuring affordability for essential household needs. This approach has been successfully employed in cities like Singapore, where water tariffs are designed to recover the full cost of water production and distribution, fostering a culture of water stewardship and incentivizing technological innovations in water reuse and desalination.

However, pricing alone is insufficient. We must also address the market failures caused by externalities, such as pollution and environmental degradation. By internalizing these costs through mechanisms like pollution taxes or cap-and-trade systems for water quality, we can incentivize industries and municipalities to invest in wastewater treatment and minimize their environmental footprint.

Moreover, we must recognize that water is a shared resource that transcends geopolitical boundaries. Transboundary water management requires international cooperation, conflict resolution mechanisms, and robust governance frameworks to ensure equitable distribution and sustainable usage. The European Union's Water Framework Directive and the Mekong River Commission exemplify successful models of regional water governance, promoting integrated water resource management and fostering cooperation among riparian states.

Achieving SDG 6 also necessitates addressing the intricate nexus between water, energy, and food production. The water-energy-food nexus highlights the interdependencies between these critical sectors, where water is required for energy production (such as hydropower and cooling for thermal plants), and energy is needed for water extraction, desalination, and distribution. Similarly, agriculture accounts for a staggering 70% of global freshwater withdrawals. By adopting a nexus approach and fostering cross-sectoral collaboration, we can optimize resource allocation, reduce trade-offs, and unlock synergies that promote sustainable development across multiple SDGs.

Furthermore, we must recognize the disproportionate impact of water scarcity on marginalized communities, particularly women and girls in developing regions. In many parts of the world, the burden of water collection falls heavily on women and girls, undermining their educational and economic opportunities. By investing in decentralized water solutions, such as community-based water kiosks, rainwater harvesting, and off-grid water treatment technologies, we can empower these communities and unlock their full potential.

Ultimately, achieving SDG 6 requires a multifaceted approach that combines economic incentives, technological innovations, robust governance frameworks, and inclusive policies. It demands a fundamental shift in how we value, manage, and steward this precious resource. By embracing market-based solutions, fostering international cooperation, and prioritizing sustainable water management, we can unlock a virtuous cycle of economic growth, environmental preservation, and human development. The path ahead is challenging, but the rewards of a water-secure world are immeasurable, ensuring a future where no one is left behind, and the foundations of life and prosperity are accessible to all.
