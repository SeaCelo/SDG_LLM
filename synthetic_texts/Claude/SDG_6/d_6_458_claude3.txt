Here is a detailed newspaper article about Sustainable Development Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), written in the style of Forbes:

The Liquid Assets Powering the Global Economy

By 2050, over half the world's population will be living in water-stressed areas. It's a sobering reality that not only threatens human health and food security but also carries enormous economic risks that businesses can't afford to ignore. Water scarcity is disrupting operations, stifling growth, and destabilizing communities in every sector and every corner of the globe.

As the lifeblood of industry, agriculture, and energy production, water is fundamentally linked to economic vitality. The numbers illustrate the urgency: Estimates suggest that by 2030, the annual cost of global water insecurity could reach $470 billion, derailing development and progress while displacing up to 700 million people due to water scarcity.

To confront this crisis and secure long-term growth and stability, the United Nations has issued a resounding call to action through Sustainable Development Goal 6: ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. Businesses are uniquely positioned to answer this call by revolutionizing their water footprint and fostering innovation.

At the heart of SDG 6 is a profoundly counterintuitive notion: water has value, and we need to start treating it that way. Amidst the mispricing of water, the incentives to conserve have dwindled. Industrial facilities, for instance, use as much as 40% more water than necessary due to leaks and inefficiencies – a margin that drains corporate coffers and strains already depleted water sources.

"The global economy is effectively running on debt when it comes to water," cautions sustainability advisor Will Sarni, who leads the enterprise water strategy practice at Arup. "We're drawing down aquifers and water tables, driven by the presumption that water will always be available at an affordable cost."

That presumption has proven disastrous. In just the past few years, semiconductor plants in Taiwan have endured 'truck wars' to secure water deliveries, apparel giants in India have idled factories due to severe droughts, and energy companies in the U.S. have seen fracking operations grind to a halt due to water restrictions. On the other side of the coin, Starbucks has experienced backlash from communities disproportionately impacted by the company's water-intensive operations.

But the private sector's relationship with water doesn't have to be purely extractive. The paradigm is shifting, and opportunity beckons. Major players like Anheuser-Busch InBev, Coca-Cola, Ford, and Levi Strauss recognize that water security is business-critical and have embedded SDG 6 targets into their environmental and social governance (ESG) roadmaps.

The most progressive companies are treating water as a strategic asset and working to valorize it through innovations like closed-loop recycling, smart metering, wastewater reuse systems, watershed conservation projects, and stakeholder engagement initiatives. Simply put: the path to water security lies in making water too valuable to waste.

On the financial front, investors are leveraging their capital allocations and proxy votes to drive corporate action. BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, is systematically factoring water risks into its risk-assessment process while also targeting water utilities and technologies for impact investments. This year, the firm spearheaded the formation of the Circular Economy Investor Alliance, comprising institutional investors collaborating to identify and scale solutions to water scarcity and circularity challenges.

"If climate change poses an existential threat, then water scarcity represents a systemic economic risk that we have to get ahead of," said Brian Deese, Global Head of Sustainable Investing at BlackRock. "Realigning business models and investment strategies around sustainable water management is not only about mitigating those risks – it's about seizing the enormous opportunities that will emerge as the world shores up its resilience."

SDG 6 also represents a frontier market opportunity for emergent technologies. Innovations like atmospheric water harvesting, nanotech membranes for desalination and filtration, digital sensing for leak detection, and artificial intelligence for improving water network efficiencies are primed for exponential growth. 

In just the past decade, corporate investments into the water technology sector have increased nearly tenfold, now exceeding $25 billion annually. But that figure merely hints at the transformation yet to come. According to the Beauchamp Water Report, the global water technology market could be a $1 trillion sector by 2025 as demand for efficiency and water security escalates.

Beyond the economic incentives, there's an elemental altruism driving progress on SDG 6. Lack of access to safe water and sanitation perpetuates poverty, gender inequalities, malnutrition, and preventable diseases that claim nearly 800,000 lives per year, predominantly among vulnerable children.   

Socially conscious businesses are leveraging their capabilities to deliver clean water access through infrastructure projects, hygiene education initiatives, water utility investments, and cross-sector partnerships with development banks and NGOs. Recognizing the ripple effects of investing in clean water access, companies are empowering communities while cultivating prosperous new markets.

As Kate Byers, president and CEO of the non-profit Water.org, summarizes: "When people have access to safe water and sanitation at home, it kickstarts a hand-up that helps whole communities flourish."

The solutions and innovations envisioned under SDG 6 represent the next great frontier of growth - not just for businesses, but for entire economies and societal progress overall. It's a frontier marked not just by necessity, but one ripe with opportunities to unleash human potential and shared prosperity through a renewed ethos of water stewardship.  

Our future economic resilience and social stability hinge on how we value and safeguard the most precious of all resources. In an era of water disruptions, will companies allow their growth prospects to evaporate? Or will they channelize the SDG 6 imperative to tap into a vibrant new wellspring of progress?
