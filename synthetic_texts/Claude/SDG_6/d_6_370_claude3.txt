The International Labour Organization (ILO) recognizes the pivotal role of Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) – Clean Water and Sanitation – in safeguarding the well-being and productivity of the global workforce. Access to safe and affordable drinking water, adequate sanitation facilities, and sound management of water resources are fundamental prerequisites for decent working conditions and sustainable economic development.

In the context of the world of work, the lack of access to clean water and sanitation poses severe risks to the health and safety of workers, particularly in labor-intensive sectors such as agriculture, construction, and manufacturing. Waterborne diseases, like cholera and dysentery, can spread rapidly in workplaces lacking proper sanitation facilities, leading to absenteeism, reduced productivity, and increased healthcare costs. Additionally, the burden of collecting water often falls disproportionately on women and children, hindering their ability to engage in productive employment and education.

The ILO recognizes the interconnectedness of SDG 6 with other Sustainable Development Goals, such as SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), SDG 5 (Gender Equality), and SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth). For instance, the provision of safe drinking water and adequate sanitation in healthcare facilities is crucial for ensuring the well-being of both healthcare workers and patients, contributing to the achievement of SDG 3. Similarly, addressing the water and sanitation needs of women and girls in the workplace can foster their economic empowerment and promote gender equality, aligning with SDG 5.

Furthermore, the ILO acknowledges the importance of water resource management in sustaining economic activities and promoting decent work opportunities. Water scarcity and pollution can severely impact water-intensive industries, such as agriculture, mining, and manufacturing, jeopardizing employment and livelihoods. For example, in the textile industry, water pollution from dyeing and finishing processes can contaminate water sources, posing risks to both workers and local communities.

To address these challenges, the ILO advocates for a comprehensive approach that integrates water and sanitation considerations into national and organizational policies, programs, and practices. This includes promoting the ratification and implementation of relevant international labor standards, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Convention (No. 155) and the Chemicals Convention (No. 170), which address the provision of safe drinking water and adequate sanitation facilities in the workplace.

The ILO also emphasizes the importance of social dialogue and tripartite collaboration among governments, employers, and workers' organizations in developing and implementing strategies for achieving SDG 6. This includes fostering public-private partnerships, promoting sustainable water resource management practices, and investing in water and sanitation infrastructure, particularly in rural and marginalized communities.

Moreover, the ILO recognizes the need for capacity building and skills development to ensure a skilled workforce capable of managing water resources and implementing sustainable water and sanitation solutions. This includes training programs for water technicians, engineers, and policymakers, as well as raising awareness among workers and employers about the importance of water conservation and proper sanitation practices.

In conclusion, the ILO's commitment to promoting decent work and sustainable economic development is intrinsically linked to the achievement of SDG 6. By addressing water and sanitation challenges in the world of work, the ILO aims to safeguard the health, safety, and well-being of workers, foster gender equality, and contribute to sustainable economic growth, while preserving the planet's precious water resources for future generations.
