SDG 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all

By Janet Currie, Professor of Economics and Public Affairs, Princeton University

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) is a critical component of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, aiming to address the pressing global challenges of water scarcity, inadequate access to safe water and sanitation, and the deterioration of freshwater ecosystems. As a leading researcher in the fields of health economics and public policy, I have witnessed firsthand the profound impact of water insecurity on human well-being, particularly among vulnerable populations.

Water is a fundamental human right and a vital resource for sustaining life, promoting health, and enabling economic development. However, according to the World Health Organization, billions of people worldwide lack access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation services, with disproportionate burdens borne by marginalized communities in low- and middle-income countries. This crisis has far-reaching consequences, including increased risk of water-borne diseases, malnutrition, reduced school attendance, and diminished economic productivity.

Achieving SDG 6 requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the complex interplay of environmental, social, and economic factors. First and foremost, we must prioritize the expansion of sustainable and resilient water infrastructure, particularly in regions affected by water scarcity, rapid urbanization, and climate change-induced stresses. This involves investment in water treatment facilities, distribution networks, and decentralized solutions such as rainwater harvesting and desalination plants. However, infrastructure alone is insufficient; we must also address the underlying drivers of water insecurity, including inefficient water management practices, unsustainable consumption patterns, and inadequate governance frameworks.

A key aspect of SDG 6 is the protection and restoration of water-related ecosystems, such as wetlands, rivers, and aquifers. These natural systems play a vital role in regulating water cycles, mitigating floods and droughts, and supporting biodiversity. Yet, they are under immense pressure from pollution, overexploitation, and land-use changes. Adopting an integrated water resources management approach, which considers the interdependencies between water, land, and ecosystems, is crucial for ensuring the long-term sustainability of our freshwater resources.

Furthermore, achieving SDG 6 necessitates addressing the complex socioeconomic factors that contribute to water insecurity. Poverty, gender inequalities, and lack of education are often closely linked to limited access to safe water and sanitation services. Empowering marginalized communities, particularly women and girls, through participatory decision-making processes and capacity-building initiatives is essential for fostering sustainable water management practices and promoting behavioral change.

Innovative financing mechanisms and public-private partnerships will also play a critical role in mobilizing the substantial investments required to achieve SDG 6. However, these efforts must be complemented by robust governance frameworks that prioritize transparency, accountability, and equitable resource allocation. Effective water governance requires collaboration across sectors and stakeholders, including governments, civil society organizations, and international bodies, to ensure that water resources are managed in a sustainable and inclusive manner.

As a researcher, I am particularly excited by the potential of interdisciplinary approaches and cutting-edge technologies to address the water crisis. For instance, integrating remote sensing data, machine learning algorithms, and hydrological models can enhance our ability to monitor water resources, predict water-related disasters, and inform decision-making processes. Additionally, advances in water treatment technologies, such as membrane filtration and nanotechnology, offer promising solutions for improving water quality and reducing energy consumption.

However, it is crucial to recognize that technological solutions alone are insufficient; they must be complemented by robust policy frameworks and stakeholder engagement. By leveraging rigorous econometric analyses and evidence-based policymaking, we can design targeted interventions that address the root causes of water insecurity while accounting for local contexts and socioeconomic disparities.

As we strive to achieve SDG 6, it is essential to acknowledge the interconnectedness of water with other Sustainable Development Goals, such as poverty alleviation, gender equality, climate action, and sustainable cities. A holistic approach that recognizes these interrelationships and fosters cross-sectoral collaboration is crucial for maximizing the positive impacts of our efforts and promoting synergies across the 2030 Agenda.

In conclusion, addressing the global water crisis is not only a moral imperative but also a strategic investment in human well-being, economic prosperity, and environmental sustainability. By embracing innovative solutions, fostering inclusive governance frameworks, and prioritizing interdisciplinary collaboration, we can chart a path towards achieving SDG 6 and ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.
