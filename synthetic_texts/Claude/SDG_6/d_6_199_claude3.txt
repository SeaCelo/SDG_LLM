Here is a draft academic article on SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), written from the perspective of the late economist Walter E. Williams:

Water is life's mover. Without it, nothing can grow and no organism can survive. Despite this fundamental truth, millions of people around the world lack access to safe water and sanitation - a human rights travesty rooted in systemic poverty and misguided government policies.  

According to the United Nations, 2.2 billion people lack access to safely managed drinking water, while 4.2 billion go without safe sanitation services. Each day, nearly 1,000 children die from preventable water and sanitation-related diseases. The impacts ripple across every facet of human wellbeing - children miss school, parents forfeit income, productive lifetimes are cut short. All of this perpetuates the cycle of poverty and despair.

The global community set SDG 6 to "ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all" by 2030. An admirable goal, but one that betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of the root causes. The lack of clean water and sanitation is not a resource problem to be solved through foreign aid or public investment. It's a problem of perverse incentives, centralized control, and the violation of private property rights.

In the poorest areas, water distribution is monopolized through government utilities which are rife with inefficiency, corruption, and broken infrastructure. Prices are kept artificially low through political suppression, reducing any incentive for efficient usage or investment in new systems. Meanwhile, private alternatives or entrepreneurial initiatives for water delivery are restricted or outright criminalized under antiquated legal regimes. The result? Scarcity, poor quality, and little recourse for those being underserved.

The solution lies in privatization, decentralization, and securing property rights over water resources. Only when water can be legally owned and traded will the proper market incentives for conservation and sustainable investment emerge. This allows efficient prices to rise and fall with demand, new water technologies and businesses to be unleashed, and a culture of responsible stewardship over this vital resource.

In regions that have embraced market principles for water management, the transformative impacts have been astounding. Just look at the privatization reforms in places like Chile or the successes of decentralized community management models across parts of South Asia. Dramatic improvements in access, quality, and efficiency - all through incentive realignment rather than bloated public financing schemes.

Yet much of the international development community remains stuck in their antiquated ideological ruts, unwilling to disrupt the comfortable status quo of bureaucratic control and misguided subsidies. If we're serious about achieving the water and sanitation goals of the 2030 Agenda, we must be bold enough to finally dismantle the governmental failures and unleash the regenerative power of free markets.

Private property rights formed the basis for prosperity throughout history - there's no reason the same principles cannot ensure universal access to drinking water in our modern era. The path is clear, though the political courage to pursue it remains lacking. For the billions sufferingwaterborne diseases, robbed of human potential, we must demand nothing less than a radical rethinking of the conventional approach. Their very lives depend upon it.
