Here is a long academic article on SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) drafted as if written by the author Chetan Bhagat:

Water, My Friends

You know what amazes me the most about water? Even after millions of years of the Earth's evolution, the same water molecules are still circulating through the hydrologic cycle - evaporating from oceans, condensing into clouds, precipitating as rain or snow, and flowing back into the seas. It's like this endless circle of life that humans have been riding along on for all of our existence.

But here's the hitch - for something so fundamental to all life on this planet, access to clean, safe water and basic sanitation is still a luxury for far too many people. We live in this modern age of technological marvels, yet almost 800 million people lack even a basic drinking water service. Two billion people still have to defecate in fields, plastic bags, or wherever they can due to lack of proper toilets. Every two minutes a child dies from a water-related disease like cholera or diarrhea.

Can you even imagine what that must be like? To wake up each morning preoccupied with the thought of where you'll be able to find water to drink or bathe or cook with that day? To have your children miss school because they are desperately ill from preventable waterborne illnesses? To have to defecate in the open and face harassment, sexual violence, or animal attacks? For millions upon millions of people, this is the terrible reality they face daily through no fault of their own.  

My friends, it does not have to be this way. The Sustainable Development Goals lay out a beautiful vision for the world - one where every single person has access to safe and affordable drinking water as well as access to adequate sanitation and hygiene by 2030. Those are big, lofty goals for sure. But I have faith that if we rally together as a global community and put our hearts and minds to it, we can absolutely make it happen.

Consider this - extending just basic water supply and sanitation services in urban areas could provide a net economic benefit of $220 billion per year from saved health costs and increased productivity. Improved water resource management has the potential to create millions of new jobs. Universal access to safe water and sanitation could prevent millions of child deaths annually from diseases like diarrhea, cholera, dysentery, and typhoid. Clearly, investing in clean water and sanitation is not just the right thing to do morally and ethically, but it makes sound economic sense as well.

So where do we even start to make an impact? Well, fortunately the SDGs give us a handy roadmap with some specific targets to hit by 2030:

1) Achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all. No more children or families having to drink contaminated water that makes them ill.

2) Achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation. No more indignity of defecating in public spaces.

3) Improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing release of hazardous materials. Our rivers, lakes, and aquifers are not dumping grounds for untreated waste and chemicals.

4) Substantially increase water-use efficiency across all sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals of freshwater. We have to use water far more responsibly in agriculture, industry, and homes.

5) Implement integrated water resources management at all levels. Our management of this precious resource needs to be cohesive and coordinated at local, regional, and national levels.

Those are big goals, but certainly achievable ones if we get governments, the private sector, civil society, and everyday citizens working collaboratively. We need major investments in water infrastructure - treatment plants, piping and delivery systems, sewage networks,  irrigation systems. We need robust water management policies based on accurate data and input from all stakeholders. We need affordable financing mechanisms to extend services to underserved populations. We need public education campaigns to drive behavioral changes around water usage, sanitation practices, and hygiene.

Most of all, we need the citizens of the world to demand action from their leaders. To see access to clean water and basic sanitation not as an idealistic dream, but as a fundamental human right that everyone deserves no matter their circumstances. When the voices of the people resonate from every corner of the globe, that's when our political and business leaders will be forced to listen and act boldly.

My friends, today's water crisis is one of cruel injustice. But it doesn't have to be this way. We have the resources, the knowledge, and the means to ensure universal access to clean water and sanitation within our lifetimes. All we need is the will to make it happen - a will that is fundamentally driven by our shared belief that every single person deserves to live a life of health and dignity. It's time to rally together and make this circle of water give life to all rather than serve as a barrier of inequity as it does now. The future can be as beautifully fluid and constantly renewing as the water cycle itself - but only if we have the courage to bend it towards justice and opportunity for all people. It simply falls upon us to decide - do we accept the crises status quo, or do we take that transformative leap together towards building a better, bluer world?
