The Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6), which seeks to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, represents a fundamental pillar in the pursuit of a more equitable and prosperous world. As we grapple with the complexities of a rapidly changing global landscape, it becomes increasingly evident that addressing water scarcity and inadequate sanitation is not merely a matter of resource allocation but a multifaceted challenge intertwined with social, economic, and environmental factors.

In this article, I aim to critically examine SDG 6 through the lens of partial identification, a concept central to my work in econometric theory and its applications. Partial identification acknowledges the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty that often characterize empirical evidence, and it seeks to derive credible conclusions within the bounds of available data and knowledge.

Water scarcity, a phenomenon exacerbated by climate change, population growth, and unsustainable consumption patterns, presents a formidable obstacle to achieving SDG 6. While the precise magnitude and distribution of water stress across regions and communities may be subject to uncertainty, the available evidence unequivocally indicates that certain populations, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions, face acute water shortages. Partial identification allows us to delineate the bounds within which the true extent of water scarcity lies, enabling targeted interventions and resource allocation based on the best available information.

Furthermore, the issue of inadequate sanitation poses a significant threat to public health, environmental sustainability, and human dignity. While precise estimates of the global population lacking access to basic sanitation services may vary, the lower and upper bounds established through partial identification techniques can guide policy decisions and resource allocation. By acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in such estimates, we can design interventions that are robust to potential data limitations and account for the heterogeneity of local contexts.

Crucial to achieving SDG 6 is the recognition that water and sanitation challenges are intrinsically linked to other Sustainable Development Goals, such as poverty eradication (SDG 1), good health and well-being (SDG 3), and gender equality (SDG 5). Partial identification allows us to explore the intersections and interdependencies between these goals, shedding light on the potential synergies and trade-offs that may arise in their pursuit.

For instance, inadequate access to safe water and sanitation disproportionately impacts women and girls, who often bear the burden of collecting water and managing household sanitation needs. Partial identification techniques can help quantify the bounds of this gender disparity, informing targeted interventions that promote gender equality while simultaneously addressing water and sanitation challenges.

Moreover, the intricate relationship between water scarcity, food security, and economic development underscores the multidimensional nature of SDG 6. Partial identification can elucidate the potential impacts of water stress on agricultural productivity, food prices, and economic growth, enabling policymakers to anticipate and mitigate potential consequences.

Achieving SDG 6 also necessitates a nuanced understanding of the intricate interplay between human activities, environmental factors, and technological advancements. Partial identification can shed light on the bounds within which various interventions, such as water conservation practices, desalination technologies, and wastewater treatment methods, may contribute to sustainable water and sanitation management.

Furthermore, the pursuit of SDG 6 must be grounded in a recognition of the inherent heterogeneity that characterizes water and sanitation challenges across different contexts. Partial identification allows us to account for this heterogeneity, tailoring interventions to the specific needs and constraints of local communities, while acknowledging the potential for unobserved factors to influence outcomes.

Ultimately, the achievement of SDG 6 hinges on our ability to navigate the complexities and uncertainties that permeate this multifaceted challenge. Partial identification offers a powerful conceptual framework and a set of analytical tools that can guide decision-making processes, enabling us to derive credible conclusions within the bounds of available information. By embracing the principles of partial identification, we can design interventions that are robust, context-specific, and cognizant of the interdependencies that underpin the Sustainable Development Goals.

As we strive towards a more sustainable and equitable world, SDG 6 stands as a testament to the inextricable link between water, sanitation, and human well-being. Through the lens of partial identification, we can navigate the uncertainties that characterize this complex challenge, charting a course towards a future where access to safe water and adequate sanitation is a universal reality, paving the way for improved health, economic prosperity, and environmental sustainability.
