Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), written from the perspective of Polly Toynbee:

Access to safe water and sanitation is not just about health and hygiene - it's about human dignity, gender equality, and socio-economic opportunity. Yet today, billions still lack these most basic necessities. The staggering inequalities around the world in access to clean water and proper toilets expose the brutal divides in our societies.  

It's nothing short of a moral outrage that in 2023, a newborn in Somalia is 55 times more likely to die from water-related diarrheal diseases than one born in the UK. Lack of clean water and sanitation robs children of their future before they've even started. Chronic diarrhea stunts both physical and cognitive development. How can any child thrive when spending every day fighting for survival?

This catastrophic inequality doesn't just impact personal health, but traps entire communities in extreme poverty. When women and girls must spend hours each day fetching water from miles away, it's functionally impossible for them to get an education or earn a livelihood. It consigns them to a life of back-breaking labor, perpetuating cycles of gender oppression.

Meanwhile, human waste fouling streets and drainage systems spreads infectious diseases and environmental contamination, compounding the public health crisis. These unsanitary conditions breed poverty, social instability, and conflict as competition for dwindling clean water becomes fierce. 

We cannot simply turn a blind eye as drought, population growth, and climate change threaten water security worldwide. Multinational corporations unrestrained quest for profits already imperils clean water access across the Global South. From Coca-Cola draining aquifers in India to mining giants polluting river basins, corporate avarice is robbing untold millions of their right to water.

All too often, it is the indigenous communities and rural poor who bear the brunt when industries usurp water rights for their own gain. Just look at the catastrophe unfurling in the Amazon basin, where a megadrought fueled by climate change and deforestation by agribusiness has left indigenous tribes desperate for potable water.  

Yet even amid such grim realities, the solutions are clear if we can muster the political courage. We must treat water and sanitation as public goods, not commodities to be exploited. This means wealthy nations honoring their aid commitments, debt relief for struggling countries, and a binding global treaty protecting water rights.

Clean water infrastructure and sanitation services must be publicly owned and democratically governed at the local level. Indigenous groups and marginalized communities must have decision-making power. But it also requires revisiting trade policies that forbid national water ownership and safeguarding water access from corporate profiteering.

No change will come without organized public pressure on leaders to act. That means mass political activism to confront corporate power and dismantle the vested interests perpetuating water apartheid. We need global water justice movements championing equitable public water trusts, rainwater harvesting, and sustainable irrigation.

Fundamentally, this is a crisis of moral obscenity and runaway inequality enabled by unfettered corporate greed. Yet it is well within our power to create a water-secure future as a matter of human rights and shared dignity.

No child anywhere should risk death for lack of clean water. No mother should endure the shattering grief of a diarrheal disease's cruelty. We must reclaim our democratic sovereignty over water and sanitation as public goods. The human right to water must be achieved through mass civil action and a revolutionary re-envisioning of global water governance in the public interest. The path is clear: now we need the political will.
