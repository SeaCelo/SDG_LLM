The Czech Development Agency's report on Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) – Clean Water and Sanitation – underscores the critical importance of addressing the global water crisis. Despite progress made in recent decades, billions of people worldwide still lack access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation facilities, perpetuating cycles of poverty, poor health, and environmental degradation.

The agency's analysis highlights the intricate nexus between water, sanitation, and sustainable development. Water scarcity, exacerbated by climate change, population growth, and unsustainable consumption patterns, poses a severe threat to food security, economic productivity, and ecosystem integrity. Inadequate sanitation, meanwhile, contributes to the spread of waterborne diseases, compromising public health and stunting human development.

The report emphasizes the need for a comprehensive, integrated approach to water resource management, recognizing the interconnectedness of SDG 6 with other Sustainable Development Goals. Achieving universal access to safe and affordable drinking water (Target 6.1) and adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene (Target 6.2) requires addressing issues such as water pollution (Target 6.3), water-use efficiency (Target 6.4), integrated water resource management (Target 6.5), and protecting and restoring water-related ecosystems (Target 6.6).

Drawing from case studies and best practices, the report underscores the importance of innovative technologies and infrastructure for water treatment, desalination, and wastewater management. However, it also highlights the need for robust governance frameworks, institutional capacity-building, and community engagement to ensure the sustainability and equitable distribution of water resources.

The agency's analysis delves into the unique challenges faced by different regions and contexts, such as water scarcity in arid and semi-arid regions, water stress in rapidly urbanizing areas, and the vulnerabilities of small island developing states to sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion. It also examines the disproportionate impacts of water insecurity on marginalized communities, women, and children, emphasizing the need for gender-responsive and socially inclusive policies and interventions.

The report advocates for a paradigm shift in water resource management, moving away from a supply-driven approach towards a more holistic, demand-side management approach that emphasizes water conservation, efficiency, and sustainable consumption patterns. It highlights the potential of nature-based solutions, such as restoring wetlands and implementing sustainable urban drainage systems, to complement traditional infrastructure investments.

Furthermore, the agency's analysis stresses the importance of international cooperation, knowledge-sharing, and technology transfer in addressing transboundary water issues and supporting developing countries in achieving SDG 6. It emphasizes the need for increased financial resources, both from domestic and international sources, to bridge the investment gap in water and sanitation infrastructure.

Throughout the report, the Czech Development Agency underscores the urgency of addressing the water crisis as a critical enabler for achieving the entire 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It calls for concerted efforts from governments, civil society, the private sector, and international organizations to prioritize water and sanitation as a fundamental human right and a catalyst for sustainable development, leaving no one behind.
