Splish, Splash: The Urgent Need for Clean Water and Proper Sanitation

By Michael Kinsley

Water is life. It's a maxim so profoundly true that it borders on tautology. Yet for far too many people around the world, accessing that life-giving resource is an epic struggle marked by disease, drudgery, and despair. That's why addressing the global crisis in water and sanitation must be a top priority for anyone claiming to care about human rights, economic development, or planetary sustainability.

The statistics are sobering. Around 2.2 billion people lack access to safely managed drinking water services, and 4.2 billion go without safely managed sanitation. Diarrheal disease linked to dirty water and poor sanitation is a leading cause of death for children under 5, killing around 297,000 each year. In some countries, women and girls spend over six hours per day fetching water from distant sources, time better spent pursuing an education or engaging in productive economic activity.

The impact transcends just health issues too. Inadequate sanitation contaminates entire watersheds, undermining agricultural productivity and potentially food security. Intense competition over scarce freshwater resources has triggered armed conflicts and geopolitical tensions that imperil regional stability. Economic losses from polluted water and lack of basic sanitation services amount to staggering sums equivalent to up to 7% of GDP in some nations.  

Clearly, this is an urgent crisis deserving immediate global action. But it is also an opportunity — a chance to target investment and policies that yield a bounty of compounding benefits across multiple sectors and development goals simultaneously. After all, access to clean water and sanitation acts as a powerful force-multiplier, boosting outcomes in education, gender equality, economic productivity, environmental sustainability, and more.

With that big picture in mind, the surest path to progress starts at the source: Safeguarding and restoring the water cycle itself. That means dramatically improving watershed management, curbing rampant pollution, preventing the overexploitation of groundwater reserves, and expanding access to safely treated drinking water and wastewater services.  

Developing countries will require robust funding and technical support to modernize crumbling and inadequate water infrastructure, which is an urgent imperative. But developed nations can't be complacent either; witness the drinking water contamination crisis in Flint, Michigan or the decrepit state of water systems across much of rural America. Even wealthy countries with generally sound infrastructure face new challenges from aging pipes, emerging pollutants, and climate change strains. We're all in the same leaky boat.

Crucially, meaningfully tackling the water crisis also requires a holistic approach that extends far beyond just building treatment plants and laying pipes. Innovative solutions will be needed — whether it's empowering local communities to maintain water systems, promoting low-cost household treatment methods, or seeding markets for cost-effective sanitation technologies tailored to high density urban slums. Policymakers must enact water pricing and regulation models that promote conservation and prevent waste. Public awareness campaigns can boost hygiene practices. Partnerships across government, the private sector, NGOs, and academia will be vital for sharing knowledge and scaling successes.

If it sounds massively complicated and vexingly multifaceted, that's because it is. But the core underlying principle is quite simple and intuitive: We must value water as the precious resource it is, not squander it thoughtlessly. After all, when you're bone dry and dying of thirst, water is the only currency that matters.

Achieving this Sustainable Development Goal on clean water and sanitation may seem like an arduous, endless slog. But the prize is immense — a healthier, more prosperous, and just world for all. If that's not enough motivation to make a splash, I don't know what is.
