The Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development presents this analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6): Clean Water and Sanitation. This goal aims to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all by 2030.

Water scarcity remains a critical global challenge, exacerbated by climate change, population growth, urbanization, and unsustainable consumption patterns. Nearly 2 billion people lack access to safely managed drinking water services, and over 3.6 billion lack safely managed sanitation facilities. This crisis disproportionately affects marginalized communities, perpetuating poverty, gender inequality, and poor health outcomes.

Achieving SDG 6 requires a multifaceted and coordinated approach that addresses the intricate nexus of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH). Inadequate WASH infrastructure and services are a leading cause of preventable diseases, contributing to millions of deaths annually, particularly among children under five. Ensuring universal access to WASH is not only a human rights imperative but also a critical enabler for achieving other SDGs, such as eliminating poverty, promoting gender equality, and improving health and well-being.

Sustainable water resource management is paramount to address water scarcity and ensure equitable access. This involves implementing integrated water resource management (IWRM) strategies at the national and transboundary levels, promoting water-use efficiency, and protecting and restoring water-related ecosystems. Innovative approaches, such as water harvesting, desalination, and wastewater treatment and reuse, offer promising solutions to augment water supplies and mitigate water stress.

Addressing water quality is another crucial aspect of SDG 6. Untreated wastewater and industrial and agricultural runoff contaminate freshwater sources, posing severe health risks and ecosystem degradation. Implementing robust wastewater treatment facilities and promoting sustainable agricultural practices are essential to safeguard water quality and protect aquatic ecosystems.

Furthermore, achieving SDG 6 requires addressing the unique challenges faced by developing countries and regions affected by conflict and natural disasters. Inadequate financing, weak governance, and limited technical capacity hinder progress in these contexts. International cooperation, technology transfer, and capacity-building initiatives are vital to support these nations in developing and implementing sustainable WASH solutions.

Engaging local communities and promoting participatory decision-making processes are critical to ensuring that WASH interventions are culturally appropriate, sustainable, and aligned with local needs and priorities. Empowering women and marginalized groups in WASH management and decision-making is particularly important, as they often bear the burden of water collection and are disproportionately affected by inadequate WASH services.

Achieving SDG 6 also requires robust monitoring and data collection systems to track progress, identify gaps, and inform policy and investment decisions. Strengthening national and global monitoring frameworks, leveraging innovative technologies such as remote sensing and crowdsourcing, and promoting data transparency and accessibility are essential to support evidence-based decision-making.

Attaining SDG 6 necessitates a concerted effort from all stakeholders, including governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector. Innovative financing mechanisms, such as blended finance and public-private partnerships, can mobilize the necessary resources and leverage expertise to accelerate progress.

In conclusion, achieving SDG 6 is a complex and multidimensional challenge that requires a holistic and integrated approach. It demands sustainable water resource management, universal access to WASH services, protection of water quality, and robust monitoring and data collection systems. By addressing these interconnected issues, we can unlock progress towards other SDGs and create a more sustainable, equitable, and prosperous future for all.
