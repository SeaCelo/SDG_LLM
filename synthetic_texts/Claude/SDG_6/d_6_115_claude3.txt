Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) from the perspective of Terence Blacker:

The Liquid Profanity: Water Scarcity and the Crisis of the Civilized World 
By Terence Blacker

It is the most vital of all resources — the elemental compound that sustains life itself. Yet in our age of technological wonders and soaring human progress, a crisis of unthinkable proportions looms over the future of water on this planet. The great documentary poet W.H. Auden declared, "Thousands have lived without love, not one without water." How cruelly ironic it is, then, that in the 21st century billions still lack access to safe drinking sources and adequate sanitation systems.  

The statistics are as stark as the sun-baked terrain of the world's burgeoning deserts: over 2 billion people live in water-stressed countries, a number projected to soar as groundwater reserves deplete. Nearly half the global population faces acute scarcity at least once per year. Unsanitary conditions birthed by this scarcity claim over 800,000 young lives annually from diarrheal diseases. No longer can we afford to ignore the liquid profanity that is global water insecurity.  

There was a time when mighty rivers like the Nile, Tigris, and Euphrates birthed the enlightened cultures that laid the foundations for our modern civilization. Our paved metropolises and tech utopias stand as monumental tributes to the progress of man conquering the elements with the power of innovation. Yet within the shadows of these triumphs lurks the haunting inevitability of our own undoing through arrogant disregard for nature's delicate equilibrium.

Water is the primordial source from which all life emerged on this terrestrial sphere — the fundamental component that separates a thriving planet from a barren celestial rock. As human population exploded and agriculture became industrialized, our insatiable thirst for this vital resource grew exponentially. Reckless pollution, deforestation, and the ravages of climate change have disrupted the renewability of the hydrological cycle.

The great rivers and aquifers that supported cities like Angkor, Sumer, and Mohenjo-daro eventually ran dry, consigning those storied peoples to the oblivion of sand and ruin. Are we blindly accelerating toward a similar dystopian fate on a planetary scale? Consider the alarming plight of the Aral Sea, which has shriveled from the fourth largest inland sea to a ghastly smattering of toxic puddles after Soviet mismanagement. The Jordan River, once cleansed by its rushing currents, is now little more than a contaminated trickle due to political strife over access. Even in my own wealthy Britain, countless areas from Cornwall to the Fens face looming water crises from overconsumption and inadequate infrastructure.

The spiraling emergency grows more dire with each year of insufficient action. Rapidly expanding populations and economic progress in the developing world is increasing competition for dwindling freshwater reserves. Hundreds of aquifers that supply cities and food baskets are irreversibly depleting. The growing frequency of droughts and floods intensified by extreme climate patterns place ever more strain on fragile water infrastructure and crops.  

Yet in the face of this existentialist threat to our species, paltry efforts have amounted to half-measures and band-aid solutions. Instead of collaborative policies to insulate the commons from disastrous overconsumption, we remain imprisoned by the territorial thinking of discordant nation-states selfishly exploiting their water sources while ignoring those left in the arid wastelands beyond borders. There is grave urgency in shifting the paradigm toward more sustainable practices to secure freshwater reserves before this precious resource spins completely out of control and catalyzes unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe.

Proactive investment in wastewater recycling, desalination, rainwater harvesting, and regenerative agricultural methods must become a global priority on par with space exploration. Comprehensive enforceable treaties governing cross-boundary water usage and protection of fragile watersheds are imperative. Systemic conservation and rationing policies should be adopted in regions most at risk. Above all, we must embrace a more holistic understanding of our place within the delicate balance of the natural world. 

Water holds a spiritual resonance for faiths and philosophies across cultures—it is the purifying essence of life. For the Hindu, the Ganga is a sacred artery flowing from the immortal realm. To Islam, water is a divine gift that must be allocated with egalitarian virtue. Even hard rationalists like Democritus recognized the wisdom that "Nothing exists except atoms and empty space; everything else is opinion." Will our conceited opinions and the detritus of civilization condemn this reverent substance to an empty void?
 
This is the imperative crossroads humanity faces in the pursuit of SDG 6. Failure is a privilege we can no longer afford. The civilization that conquers this hydrological crisis through enlightened global cooperation will be the one that secures its destiny amid the coming strife for the world's most precious resource. Those who blithely ignore its clarion call will inevitably meet the same parched demise as the once-great empires now erased from the desert winds. The choice to preserve or squander this liquid birthright is ours. But the decisions that will resonate for millennia must be made clear through the turbid present.
