Here is a detailed academic paper on SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) written from the perspective of Jonah Goldberg:

Clean Water for Whom? A Hard Look at the UN's Grand Vision for SDG 6

By Jonah Goldberg

The United Nations has lofty ambitions with its Sustainable Development Goal for ensuring access to clean water and sanitation for all by 2030. Like many grandiose bureaucratic visions, SDG 6 looks great on paper, appealing to our moral sensibilities about social justice and human rights. Easy to get behind, right? After all, who could object to the notion that everyone deserves clean drinking water and basic sanitation services?

But as always, the devil is in the details - or lack thereof. While the UN's PR machine touts the virtuous SDG rhetoric about leaving no one behind, the actual implementation poses huge practical and philosophical challenges that the development wonks gloss over. For one, what exactly qualifies as "clean" water? The goalposts seem to constantly shift among self-appointed experts debating quality standards, making it a moving target for countries to aim at. 

And how do we define "access" - must every rural household have their own private well or centralized plumbing? Or is having a communal source within a reasonable walking distance sufficient? Are we prioritizing piped household taps and flush toilets, or are pit latrines and water hauling considered adequate "access"? These are not merely academic questions - they determine how trillions in development funding gets allocated towards different technological solutions.

Moreover, the SDG framework presupposes a one-size-fits-all, top-down approach to water management. But hydrological and social conditions vary immensely across regions, making centralized solutions woefully inadequate. Arid zones like the Arabian Peninsula face completely different water challenges than tropical rainforests. Densely populated megacities have different needs than subsistence farming villages. A more sustainable approach recognizes the importance of local knowledge, customs and governance in tailoring solutions instead of imposing Procrustean mandates from on high.

We'd also be remiss to ignore the economic realities. Fresh water is a scarce resource, and scarcity necessitates difficult tradeoffs. Treating water as a free good, as SDG 6 implicitly does, completely distorts the incentive structure for efficient use and sustainable investment. It overlooks how markets and pricing mechanisms are indispensable for optimizing supply and demand. Even if well-intentioned, subsidizing water access too aggressively begets waste, distorts consumer behavior, and drains public coffers. Insisting that water is a human right that must be free at the point of use is economically destructive wishful thinking.

SDG 6 is also predicated on cradle-to-grave coddling of individuals by an administrative Leviathan - an increasingly antiquated vision at odds with the way the world actually works in an age of urbanization, economic modernization and NGO/private sector innovation. The centralizers arrogantly assume individuals are helpless wards to be managed from afar rather than autonomous agents capable of conjuring local solutions if given economic freedom and secure property rights. From community water trusts to water kiosk franchises, the most promising water breakthroughs come from bottom-up entrepreneurialism, not top-down mandates.

And let's not overlook how SDG 6's implicit anti-development biases ignore humanity's ultimate engine for clean water access: economic growth and rising living standards. As societies urbanize, transition to industrial and service economies, and join global supply chains, they accumulate the capital, technology and infrastructure to make clean water systems more viable and affordable. The surest path to universal clean water access is growth-oriented economic liberalization, not romantic Environmental Marxism about water as a free human right.

While well-intentioned at face value, SDG 6 exemplifies everything wrong with the UN's technocratic, bureaucratic approach to meeting humankind's needs. Rather than empowering local problem-solvers, SDG 6 seeks to centralize control over water in the hands of unaccountable Planners obsessed with resource constraints instead of economic dynamism. It naively vilifies markets, dismissing pricing as anathema to human rights. And it arrogantly dismisses growth as incompatible with sustainability, instead peddling environmental puritanism that preserves poverty.

No thanks. For anyone sincerely committed to expanding clean water access - not just burnishing moral credentials - we must ditch the self-righteous SDG cheerleading and focus on what actually works.
