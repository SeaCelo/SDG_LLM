Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), written from the perspective of Gail Collins, the American journalist and op-ed columnist:

The Chutzpah of Sanitation: Why Water Is a Feminist Issue 

By Gail Collins

You know those magazine articles that begin with the writer out for a placid walk in nature, taking in the beauty all around, when suddenly she chances upon a shocking scene that embodies everything that's wrong with society today? Well, that's pretty much how I wound up obsessing about the international crisis in water and sanitation.

It was a lovely spring day and I was hiking on a trail near my home, admiring the wildflowers, when I came across a young woman squatting by the side of the path. She was obviously in great distress, trying her damnedest to find a private spot to relieve herself. The indignity of her situation was palpable – the desperation to take care of such a basic human need, while being utterly exposed in broad daylight. When she saw me approaching, her face flushed crimson with shame and embarrassment.

In that moment, I was struck by how the most mundane of human functions – using the toilet – is denied to billions of people around the world who lack access to basic sanitation facilities. From rural villages to urban slums, nearly half the global population is forced into utterly degrading situations every single day, simply to answer nature's call.

This crisis hits women and girls the hardest. Beyond the obvious health risks and physical dangers of defecating in the open, they face the constant fear of harassment, violence, or brutal attack. All too often, they resort to Going Only At Night – a euphemism that masks unfathomable indignities – and risk being ambushed by predators lurking in the shadows.

Many girls drop out of school once they reach puberty because of inadequate toilet facilities. Menstruation becomes an exercise in shame and seclusion, staining not just their clothes but their human rights. Is it any wonder maternal mortality rates are obscenely high in places where pregnant women must risk their lives simply to relieve themselves?

Even in wealthy nations, antiquated thinking about sanitation carries a sexist stench. Why is it still seen as women's work to keep the household bathrooms sparkling? Why do misogynistic morons gleefully deride their political opponents as being crappy managers of public restrooms? (Looking at you, Mayor de Blasio.)  

When you really start digging into the sanitation crisis, you quickly realize it's about a whole lot more than toilets and plumbing. At its core, this is an issue of human dignity, gender discrimination, and social equity. People who lack access to clean water and safe sanitation have zero chance of breaking out of poverty. Communities get trapped in an endless cycle of disease, lost educational opportunities, diminished economic productivity, and environmental degradation.

Solving this crisis is quite literally a matter of life and death, especially for children under 5 who are most vulnerable. Nearly 1,000 kids perish each day from preventable water-related diseases like diarrhea. Let that statistic sink in for a moment – a thousand tiny coffins, every 24 hours, all because someone couldn't access something as basic as a properly functioning toilet.

So you'd think the global community would be mobilizing with fierce urgency to achieve the UN's Sustainable Development Goal #6: ensuring universal access to safe water and sanitation by 2030. The estimated cost of $114 billion per year may sound like a lot, but it actually pencils out to a rounding error when you consider the economic benefits of healthier, more productive populations.

Yet progress has been painfully slow. Millions of households in sub-Saharan Africa still collect drinking water from contaminated ponds and defecate in plastic bags. In Afghanistan, two-thirds of schools have no working sanitation facilities for students. In India's megacities, rivers have become fetid open sewers. Even parts of America's wealthy suburbs struggle to replace ancient, leaking pipes that discharge raw sewage into rivers and bays.

At the root of this morass is the same squalid truth: the poor and powerless get, quite literally, crapped on. Whether in rural Guatemala or urban Michigan, sanitation infrastructures have historically bypassed the most marginalized neighborhoods. Wealthy residents turn a blind eye to impoverished districts choking on their own filth.

Which takes us back to that young woman in the woods, trying to preserve a shred of personal privacy while forced to act like a lower mammalian life form. She represented the 673 million people remaining on this planet who still practice open defecation. The sanitation crisis is a consequence of institutional inequities and deep-rooted prejudices – racial, economic, and above all, gender-based. It's emblematic of how society dismisses the basic needs of half the human population as an unspeakable taboo.

So let's speak about this taboo loudly and clearly. Menstrual hygiene, maternal health, personal dignity – these are feminist issues inextricably linked to the goal of achieving access to clean water and sanitation for all people, everywhere. Dismissing this crisis as distasteful or unmentionable only perpetuates the shameful subjugation of women and girls worldwide.
