The region's progress towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation has been uneven, with significant disparities across countries and populations. ECLAC's recent analysis reveals a concerning trend: while urban areas have seen steady improvements in access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation services, rural and marginalized communities continue to lag behind, exacerbating existing inequalities.

In many Central American and Andean nations, inadequate investment in water infrastructure, coupled with rapid urbanization and climate change impacts, has resulted in water scarcity and contamination issues. Indigenous communities in remote areas often lack access to improved water sources, relying on unprotected wells or surface water that pose severe health risks. Alarmingly, waterborne diseases remain a leading cause of child mortality in these regions.

The Caribbean nations face unique challenges due to their island geography and vulnerability to extreme weather events. Saltwater intrusion into coastal aquifers, exacerbated by sea-level rise and storm surges, has rendered freshwater sources unusable for human consumption and agricultural purposes. Additionally, inadequate wastewater treatment facilities have led to the contamination of coastal waters, threatening fragile ecosystems and vital tourism industries.

On a positive note, several South American countries have made significant strides in expanding access to safe water and sanitation services, particularly in urban centers. However, these efforts have been hampered by rapid population growth, informal settlements, and aging infrastructure. Maintaining and upgrading existing systems remains a critical challenge, as does extending coverage to peri-urban and rural areas.

Furthermore, the region's water resources are under increasing pressure from unsustainable agricultural practices, industrial pollution, and the impacts of climate change. Droughts and floods are becoming more frequent and severe, disrupting water supplies and exacerbating conflicts over shared water resources. Integrated water resource management strategies, which consider the needs of various sectors and stakeholders, are essential for ensuring sustainable and equitable access to water.

To accelerate progress towards SDG 6, ECLAC recommends a multi-faceted approach that addresses both supply and demand-side issues. On the supply side, increased investment in water infrastructure, including desalination plants, wastewater treatment facilities, and rainwater harvesting systems, is crucial. However, these investments must be coupled with demand management strategies, such as pricing policies that promote efficient water use, public awareness campaigns, and the adoption of water-saving technologies in agriculture and industry.

Additionally, strengthening institutional frameworks and governance mechanisms is vital for effective water resource management. This includes enhancing coordination among relevant ministries and agencies, empowering local communities in decision-making processes, and promoting transboundary cooperation in shared water basins.

Ultimately, achieving SDG 6 in the region requires a holistic approach that recognizes the interconnectedness of water with other development goals, such as poverty alleviation, food security, energy production, and climate resilience. By addressing water challenges through an integrated and inclusive lens, the region can build more sustainable and equitable societies, ensuring that no one is left behind in access to this fundamental human right.
