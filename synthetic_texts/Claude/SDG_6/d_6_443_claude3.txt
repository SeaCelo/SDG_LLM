SDG 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all

As a leading international non-profit development organization, SNV Netherlands Development Organisation has been at the forefront of promoting sustainable water and sanitation solutions globally. Our efforts align directly with the ambitious targets set forth by the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6), which aims to ensure universal access to safe and affordable drinking water, adequate sanitation, and hygiene services by 2030, while also addressing critical challenges related to water scarcity, water quality, and integrated water resource management.

Our organization's approach to SDG 6 is multifaceted, encompassing both community-level interventions and advocacy efforts at the national and international levels. Through our extensive network of field offices and partnerships with local communities, we have implemented numerous projects aimed at improving access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities, particularly in rural and peri-urban areas where the need is most acute.

One of our flagship initiatives is the Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) program, which has been widely adopted across multiple countries. CLTS empowers communities to collectively analyze their sanitation situation and take collective action to become open defecation-free (ODF). By fostering a sense of ownership and promoting behavioral change, this approach has proven highly effective in achieving sustainable sanitation outcomes. Additionally, we have integrated CLTS with initiatives focused on menstrual hygiene management, addressing the often-overlooked needs of women and girls in this domain.

In parallel, we have actively supported the development and implementation of innovative water supply technologies, such as solar-powered water pumps, rainwater harvesting systems, and decentralized water treatment solutions. These interventions not only improve access to safe drinking water but also promote water conservation and climate resilience, aligning with the broader objectives of SDG 6.

Recognizing the critical importance of water resource management, we have worked closely with government agencies, river basin organizations, and other stakeholders to promote integrated approaches to water resource management. Our efforts have focused on enhancing data collection and monitoring capabilities, developing robust water policies and governance frameworks, and fostering cross-sectoral collaboration to address complex water challenges, such as water scarcity, pollution, and ecosystem degradation.

Furthermore, our organization has been a vocal advocate for the human rights to water and sanitation, actively engaging in policy dialogues and advocacy campaigns at both national and international levels. We have contributed to shaping policies and strategies that prioritize the needs of marginalized and vulnerable communities, ensuring that no one is left behind in the pursuit of SDG 6.

As we approach the 2030 deadline for the SDGs, our organization remains steadfast in its commitment to accelerating progress towards SDG 6. We recognize that achieving universal access to water and sanitation is not only a fundamental human right but also a catalyst for economic development, improved public health, and environmental sustainability. Through our continued efforts, partnerships, and unwavering dedication, we aim to contribute significantly to the realization of SDG 6, ensuring that water and sanitation are accessible, sustainable, and equitable for all.
