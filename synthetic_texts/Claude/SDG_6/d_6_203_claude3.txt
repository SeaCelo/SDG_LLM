Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) as if written by renowned writer Gene Weingarten:

The Liquid Assets We're Flushing Away: An Inconvenient Toilet Truth

If you're reading this on the potty, you're already failing the world. Every time you grunt out another load for the sewage system, you are neglecting one of the most precious resources that makes our ridiculous little bubble of existence on this preposterous planet even possible: fresh water.

I'm talking about the sad, soggy elephant splashing around in all of our bathrooms. We've become so accustomed to having water at our beck and pull-chain that we've taken this lifeë ¥ force completely for granted. Did you know that a typical toilet uses almost 4 gallons per flush? That's 24 pounds of our planet's lifeblood gushing away with every solid waste evacuation!

Meanwhile, around 2 billion people lack basic sanitation services like toilets or latrines. Lack of access to clean water and sanitation kills more people through disease than war does. Every two minutes a child dies from a water-related illness. It's one of the most staggering human rights crises facing our world today.  

So while we're merrily turning tidy bowls of drinking water into diluted diaper soup as if there's an infinite tap, others are drinking life-threateningly fetid sludge that would make even hardened Burning Man porta-potty veterans dry-heave into their spirit hoods.

But it's not just toilet flushing that's sucking our planet dry. Agriculture uses around 70% of the world's freshwater, and much of that gets wasted through inefficient practices, leaky infrastructure, and unbalanced crops for feeding livestock instead of people. Industry is another massive aqua-abuser, releasing hazardous pollutants and chemicals that render what little fresh water remains for many communities literally lethal to drink.

Now you may be thinking, "Sure, but I live in an area with plenty of water access. What does this have to do with me?" Well, Sunny Jim, according to the UN, water scarcity could lead to sustained conflicts and mass migrations of "biblical proportions" in just 25 short years if we continue our wanton aquatic wastrels ways. 

So if you want your grandkids to spend family vacations fleeing Waterworld-esque upheaval rather than splashing in hotel pools, by all means, keep flushing our future down the crapper while other humans risk their lives for a sip of swill that would make Pig-Pen from Peanuts dry-heave.

The good news is we already have most of the technology and solutions to ensure water access and sanitation for all. It's just a matter of governments, industry, and individuals making it a priority to protect this most basic resource that birth'd us from primordial soup.

Things like investing in water recycling plants, incentivizing sustainable irrigation techniques, developing low-cost desalination methods, fixing leaky pipes, ditching industrial dumping, embracing dry-toilet tech, and yes, even doing something as simple as putting a brick in your toilet tank to reduce flush capacity. Every drop preserved counts as a tiny defiance against the great desiccation.

Because water is life itself. It coaxed us amniotically into existence. And if we aren't willing to rally around ensuring that every last human being has access to this primordial wellspring in the 21st century, we'll be regressing socially and politically to a time when desiccated ancestors would kill for a puddle to cure their choleric babes' soiled nappies.

So let's get off our ample butts and do something about this before phrases like "for a warm cup of water" replace "for a warm glass of milk" as humanitarian catastrophe descriptors. Fixing the earth's water crisis is something we all need to give a shit about.
