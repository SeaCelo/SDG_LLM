Here is a detailed newspaper article about Sustainable Development Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), written from the perspective of The Wall Street Journal:

Water Scarcity: A $1 Trillion Risk to Global Industry

Clean freshwater is not only essential for human health and survival, but also a critical input for nearly every industry. However, water scarcity driven by climate change, pollution, and poor management is placing trillions of dollars in economic activity at risk worldwide. Companies and investors are just starting to wake up to these threats.

"Water insecurity is one of the greatest systemic risks we face this century," warns Dr. Claudia Sadoff, former Director General of the International Water Management Institute. "Failure to achieve the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 6 - ensuring access to clean water and sanitation for all by 2030 - would be catastrophic for public health, food production, energy supply, and economic continuity."

While water crises have historically been viewed through a humanitarian lens, the private sector is increasingly recognizing operational vulnerabilities. A shocking 40% of the global population faces water scarcity, and that number is projected to rise due to overexploitation of groundwater reserves, pollution of freshwater systems, droughts, and population growth.  

"Companies are realizing that water risks are business risks" says Michael Bachmann, Director of Water Policy at the OECD. Food and beverage giants like Coca-Cola and AB InBev have experienced production disruptions from water shortages. Mining operations in Chile, South Africa, and Australia have been threatened by severe droughts and community opposition. Hydraulic fracturing and power plant cooling cycles are heavily water-intensive processes susceptible to scarcity.

A study from the World Bank estimates that water insecurity could cost some regions up to 6% of GDP by 2050, while globally $1 trillion per year in economic losses are possible due to inadequate water supply and sanitation. The Asian Development Bank pegs those annual losses even higher, at $1.75 trillion. 

"Those figures don't even account for the consequences of ecosystem collapse or sociopolitical instability stemming from water crises," warns Henk Ovink, Special Envoy for International Water Affairs for the Netherlands. "Unharvested crops, unextracted minerals, social unrest, mass migration - these are very real possibilities."

Some companies are forging ahead with water stewardship initiatives. Textile maker Levi Strauss audits suppliers for water risks and partners with NGOs like the World Resources Institute to promote conservation practices. Semiconductor giants Intel and TSMC invest heavily in recycling and treatment systems to reduce freshwater withdrawals.

But much more remains to be done, especially financing improved infrastructure, conservation strategies, and watershed management on a global scale. The UN estimates that $1 trillion in annual investment is required to achieve SDG 6, creating a $6.7 trillion infrastructure gap by 2030 based on current levels of spending.

It's not just an emerging markets issue - aging infrastructure and water quality crises affect developed nations too. The American Society of Civil Engineers scores U.S. drinking water and wastewater management as a D+ and D respectively due to underinvestment. The water crisis in Flint, Michigan is just the tip of the iceberg.

Private capital and innovative financing models are part of the solution. Investment funds like Emerance Capital have raised billions to finance water infrastructure globally, while specialist engineering firms like Xylem Inc. develop efficient desalination, re-use, and treatment solutions. Development banks provide concessional lending to de-risk water projects.

However, capacity building, good governance, and political will remain major barriers to achieving SDG 6. "Fundamentally, it's an issue of long-term thinking versus short-term expediency," says Sadoff. "Our economic and business models drastically undervalue water, treating it as an infinitely available free input. Those assumptions are catastrophically flawed."

Ensuring access to clean water and sanitation is not just a moral imperative, but an economic necessity to maintain corporate growth trajectories, supply chains, and social stability. The time to act is now, for water-secure future.
