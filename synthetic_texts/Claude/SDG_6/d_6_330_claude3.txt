As a leading development agency, the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) has long been committed to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with a particular focus on Goal 6: Ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. Our efforts in this regard are driven by the recognition that access to clean water and adequate sanitation is not only a fundamental human right but also a critical enabler of economic growth, social progress, and environmental sustainability.

The global water crisis remains one of the most pressing challenges of our time, with millions of people around the world lacking access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation services. This crisis is exacerbated by a multitude of factors, including climate change, rapid urbanization, population growth, and inadequate infrastructure investments. The consequences are far-reaching, from increased disease burden and child mortality to reduced agricultural productivity and ecosystem degradation.

In addressing this challenge, KOICA adopts a holistic and integrated approach that acknowledges the interconnectedness of water with other critical sectors such as agriculture, energy, and health. Our interventions are guided by a deep understanding of local contexts, and we work closely with partner countries to develop tailored solutions that align with their specific needs and priorities.

One of our flagship initiatives is the Water and Sanitation Hygiene (WASH) program, which focuses on improving access to safe water sources, promoting proper sanitation and hygiene practices, and strengthening institutional and community capacities for sustainable water resource management. Through this program, we have supported the construction and rehabilitation of water supply systems, the installation of sanitation facilities, and the implementation of community-led total sanitation campaigns in numerous countries across Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

Recognizing the critical role of capacity building, KOICA places a strong emphasis on knowledge transfer and skills development. We collaborate with local institutions and communities to enhance their technical expertise in areas such as water resource management, water quality monitoring, and wastewater treatment. This approach not only ensures the long-term sustainability of our interventions but also empowers local stakeholders to become agents of change in their own communities.

Moreover, our work in the water and sanitation sector is closely integrated with efforts to address other SDGs, such as Goal 1 (No Poverty), Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-Being), Goal 5 (Gender Equality), and Goal 13 (Climate Action). By improving access to water and sanitation, we contribute to poverty reduction, better health outcomes, increased educational opportunities (particularly for girls and women), and enhanced resilience to the impacts of climate change.

To illustrate our impact, consider our recent project in Ethiopia, where we worked closely with local communities and authorities to construct and rehabilitate water supply systems, establish community-based water management committees, and promote hygiene education. This project not only improved access to safe drinking water for over 100,000 people but also contributed to a significant reduction in waterborne diseases, increased school attendance rates (especially for girls), and enhanced economic opportunities through improved agricultural productivity.

As we move forward, KOICA remains steadfast in its commitment to achieving SDG 6 and contributing to the broader 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We recognize the need for continued innovation, collaboration, and leveraging of cutting-edge technologies to address the evolving challenges in the water and sanitation sector. This includes exploring sustainable and climate-resilient water management practices, promoting the circular economy principles in wastewater treatment and reuse, and harnessing the potential of digital solutions for improved monitoring and decision-making.

Furthermore, we understand the importance of fostering multi-stakeholder partnerships and strengthening international cooperation to accelerate progress towards SDG 6. Through collaborative efforts with governments, civil society organizations, private sector entities, and other development partners, we aim to leverage complementary expertise, resources, and networks to drive transformative change at scale.

As a global community, we must remain steadfast in our commitment to ensuring universal access to water and sanitation, recognizing its profound impact on human dignity, economic development, and environmental sustainability. KOICA stands ready to contribute its expertise, resources, and unwavering dedication to this collective endeavor, working hand in hand with partner countries and stakeholders to create a world where no one is left behind.
