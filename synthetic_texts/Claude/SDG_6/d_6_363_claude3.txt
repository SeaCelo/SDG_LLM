The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) recognizes the pivotal role of Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) – Clean Water and Sanitation – in fostering sustainable economic growth and social development across our regions of operation. Access to safe water and adequate sanitation is not only a fundamental human right but also a prerequisite for economic prosperity, public health, and environmental integrity.

In many of our countries of operation, water scarcity, poor water quality, and inadequate sanitation facilities continue to pose significant challenges, hindering economic progress and exacerbating social inequalities. The EBRD is committed to addressing these challenges through targeted investments, policy dialogues, and capacity-building initiatives.

Our approach is multifaceted, involving collaboration with governments, private sector partners, and civil society organizations. We prioritize investments in water infrastructure, such as water treatment plants, distribution networks, and sewage systems, ensuring access to safe and affordable water and sanitation services for urban and rural communities alike.

Furthermore, we recognize the importance of water resource management and the need for integrated approaches that balance the demands of various sectors, including agriculture, industry, and energy production. Our investments in water-efficient technologies and practices, particularly in water-stressed regions, aim to optimize water use and mitigate the impacts of climate change on water resources.

The EBRD also plays a crucial role in promoting water governance and policy reforms. Through policy dialogues and technical assistance, we support the development of robust legal and regulatory frameworks, encouraging transparency, stakeholder engagement, and the implementation of river basin management plans. These efforts are essential for ensuring the sustainable and equitable management of water resources.

Recognizing the interconnectedness of water and other sectors, our approach incorporates cross-sectoral considerations. For instance, investments in sustainable agriculture and energy projects often include water-related components, such as irrigation efficiency measures or wastewater treatment facilities, to minimize environmental impacts and promote resource efficiency.

Moreover, we prioritize the inclusion of marginalized communities and the promotion of gender equality in our water and sanitation projects. By engaging with local stakeholders and addressing specific needs, we strive to ensure equitable access to water and sanitation services, empowering women and vulnerable groups.

The EBRD is also at the forefront of innovative financing mechanisms for water and sanitation projects. We leverage our expertise in blended finance to attract private sector investments, mobilizing additional resources and promoting sustainable business models. This includes exploring opportunities for public-private partnerships and performance-based contracts, fostering efficiency and cost-recovery in service delivery.

As we continue to navigate the complexities of SDG 6, the EBRD remains steadfast in its commitment to supporting our countries of operation in achieving universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water, as well as access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene. By addressing the challenges of water scarcity, pollution, and inefficient water use, we contribute to the broader goals of sustainable development, environmental protection, and inclusive economic growth.
