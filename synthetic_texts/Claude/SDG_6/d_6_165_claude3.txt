Here is a long academic article on SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) in the satirical style of Carl Hiaasen:

The Wet Mirage: Florida's Farcical Failure on Water

By Cal Hiasse√±or, Visiting Fellow at the Margaritaville Institute for Wetland Restoration and Beverage Services

Down here in the great Swampocracy of Florida, we sure do love our water. We pave over it, drain it, re-route it, dam it, divert it, dump in it and generally treat it with all the reverence of a male baboon's backside. And somehow we're still surprised when we run out of the wet stuff.

Take a gander at Sustainable Development Goal 6 - you know, the quixotic UN notion that maybe, just maybe, human beings shouldn't be forced to crap in the same water supply they bathe and drink from. Here in the Gunshine State, we treat that concept with a casual disregard typically reserved for traffic laws and primary school science. 

To be fair, Florida has made some strides when it comes to expanding access to clean drinking water and adequate sanitation services. Well, if you consider "some strides" as merely outpacing the most underdeveloped nations. Pat yourselves on the back, Pork Chokers! You're no longer on par with Malawi!

The real punchline is how we're single-handedly decimating our water quality through unchecked agricultural runoff, toxic algae blooms, straight piping of sewage into public waterways, careless overdevelopment, and the mass burial of our natural water filtration systems. It's a perfect storm of eco-idiocy that would make even the dullest of Flat Earth adherents go, "Damn, y'all are some special kinds of stupid down there."

Let's take a quick dip into the rancid waters of reality:

Our prized Everglades are being slowly drained and choked out by agricultural interests so drunk on greed they'd dam the Mississippi itself if it promised an extra buck. Those famous "rivers of grass" are turning into desiccated cow pastures and biodiversity deserts. But hey, at least we got those juicy frog legs for Chili's Awesome Blossom appetizers!

Speaking of appetites, have you sampled the blue-green algae bread pudding they're serving up around Lake Okeechobee? That festering, fetid algae soup was brought to you by years of unchecked nutrient pollution from Big Sugar's reckless fertilizer bingeing. It's gotten so bad, the Army Corps of Engineers periodically just opens the floodgates and sends the toxic hellbrew pouring into the ocean. Thanks for saving those coastal fishing economies, Skell Lords!

And let's not even get started on the raw sewage debacles that turn our canals and waterways into bacterial buffets every time a hurricane or heavy rain strains our decrepit sewage infrastructure. That's been a proud Florida tradition since the days of Ponce de Leon's inaugural code brown in the Fountain of Youth.   

At this point, our once-vibrant freshwater systems have taken on all the ecological resilience and recuperative powers of a Jell-O mold left moldering in the Key West sun. Their chances of rebounding from this sustained onslaught are about as good as Donald Trump quietly retiring to bake pizzas in Dubuque.

So while the rest of the world takes tentative steps towards SDG 6 and its sanitary utopia, we Floridians remain the damp, pruney fingerpointing at our inept powers-that-be and their systemic inertia. Change is possible, but it would require our feudal lords of
