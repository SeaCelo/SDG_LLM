The Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA) recognizes the pivotal role of SDG 6 – Clean Water and Sanitation – in achieving sustainable development and safeguarding human dignity. Our global initiatives have witnessed firsthand the devastating impact of water scarcity, inadequate sanitation, and poor hygiene practices, particularly on the most vulnerable communities.

In the arid regions of sub-Saharan Africa, where droughts are becoming more frequent and severe, ADRA's interventions have focused on developing resilient water management strategies. By implementing rainwater harvesting systems, constructing sand dams, and promoting water-efficient agricultural practices, we have empowered communities to adapt to climate change and ensure a reliable water supply for domestic and agricultural purposes.

Our sanitation programs in South Asia have prioritized the construction of eco-friendly and culturally appropriate latrines, coupled with intensive community education on proper hygiene practices. By addressing the deep-rooted social and cultural barriers, we have witnessed remarkable progress in reducing open defecation, minimizing water-borne diseases, and enhancing dignity, particularly for women and girls.

In the aftermath of natural disasters, ADRA has been at the forefront of emergency response efforts, providing safe drinking water, establishing temporary sanitation facilities, and distributing hygiene kits to displaced populations. Our efforts have mitigated the spread of diseases and preserved human dignity during the most challenging circumstances.

However, our interventions extend beyond short-term relief. ADRA's long-term initiatives focus on capacity building and empowering local communities to manage their water resources sustainably. We work closely with governments, civil society organizations, and private sector partners to develop comprehensive water resource management plans, integrating sustainable practices, such as watershed management, wastewater treatment, and the promotion of efficient irrigation techniques.

Recognizing the inextricable link between water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) and other development goals, ADRA has adopted a holistic approach. Our water and sanitation initiatives are interwoven with programs addressing food security, health, education, and economic empowerment. By ensuring access to clean water and proper sanitation facilities in schools and health centers, we have contributed to improved attendance rates, better health outcomes, and enhanced opportunities for education and economic development.

ADRA's commitment to SDG 6 is rooted in the belief that access to clean water and sanitation is a fundamental human right, essential for safeguarding human dignity and unlocking the full potential of individuals and communities. We remain steadfast in our efforts to address the complex challenges posed by water scarcity, poor sanitation, and inadequate hygiene practices, recognizing that every step forward is a stride towards a more sustainable and equitable future for all.
