The International Youth Foundation presents this analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6): Clean Water and Sanitation. Water scarcity and lack of access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities remain critical global challenges, deeply intertwined with issues of poverty, health, education, and sustainable development.

Worldwide, over 2 billion people lack access to safely managed drinking water services, and 3.6 billion lack safely managed sanitation facilities. The consequences are staggering – each year, over 800,000 children under five die from diarrheal diseases linked to poor sanitation, unsafe water, and hygiene practices. In many regions, women and girls bear the primary responsibility for water collection, often walking miles and missing educational opportunities.

Progress on SDG 6 has been uneven across regions and communities. While some countries have made significant strides, others – particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia – lag behind. Rapid urbanization, climate change, and increasing water stress exacerbate existing vulnerabilities. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical role of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) in disease prevention and public health.

Achieving SDG 6 requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the complex interplay of social, economic, environmental, and political factors. Firstly, increased investment in water infrastructure, including sustainable and resilient water supply systems, wastewater treatment facilities, and sanitation services, is crucial. However, infrastructure alone is insufficient; effective governance, policy frameworks, and institutional capacity are equally vital.

In this regard, empowering local communities and ensuring their participation in decision-making processes is essential. Community-led initiatives, such as the establishment of water user associations and the promotion of decentralized water management practices, can foster a sense of ownership and accountability, leading to more sustainable solutions.

Furthermore, addressing the interlinkages between water and other SDGs is critical. For instance, improving access to WASH in schools can have a profound impact on education outcomes, particularly for girls. Similarly, investing in water-efficient agricultural practices can enhance food security and support rural livelihoods.

Innovative approaches, such as the integration of traditional knowledge systems and nature-based solutions, can offer context-specific and cost-effective alternatives to conventional water management strategies. For example, the revival of ancient water harvesting techniques, like the construction of qanats (underground water channels) in arid regions, can provide sustainable water sources while preserving cultural heritage.

Technological advancements also hold promise. Remote sensing and geographic information systems can aid in mapping water resources and identifying areas of water stress. Additionally, the development and dissemination of low-cost water purification technologies, such as solar disinfection and ceramic filters, can improve access to safe drinking water in underserved communities.

However, technology alone cannot solve the water crisis. Addressing the underlying drivers of water scarcity and inequitable access, such as poverty, gender inequality, and unsustainable consumption patterns, is paramount. This requires a holistic approach that encompasses social, economic, and environmental dimensions.

Notably, the private sector has a critical role to play in driving innovation, investment, and the adoption of sustainable water management practices. Public-private partnerships can leverage the expertise and resources of both sectors, fostering collaborative solutions that balance economic growth with environmental sustainability.

In conclusion, achieving SDG 6 is a complex and multifaceted challenge that requires concerted action at all levels – from local communities to national governments and international organizations. By adopting a comprehensive and integrated approach, investing in infrastructure and governance, fostering community engagement, leveraging innovation and technology, and addressing the root causes of water scarcity and inequity, we can make tangible progress towards ensuring access to clean water and sanitation for all.
