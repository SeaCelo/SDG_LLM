Here is a long newspaper article about SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) as if written for the provocative and irreverent tone of the New York Post:

You're Being Soaked! The Shocking Truth About the World's Dirty Water Crisis

You bunch of unwashed masses better listen up, because this is a story that's gonna make your blood boil hotter than a rusted-out fire hydrant in the South Bronx in August. We're talking about a crisis that hits harder than a UFC fighter after eating too many dirty water dogs. 

The world is facing a catastrophic shortage of clean drinking water and adequate sanitation that is ruining lives and killing people every single day. Translation for you Midtown mouth-breathers: billions of people are being forced to drink water that looks like what comes out of Hotdog Joey's bathroom at 4am after a bender. Worse than that, over 800 children under the age of 5 are dying every day from diseases directly caused by having no toilet except a trashcan or tied-off plastic bag.

So why should us proud New Yorkers care about some third-world kid taking a leak in an alleyway? Because the ripple effects of the global water crisis extend far beyond some rural village digging a well. We're talking about economic instability, conflict, mass migration, disrupted trade routes, and making this whole planet an even bigger toilet bowl.

Just look at the facts, numbnuts: Around 2.2 billion people lack access to safely managed drinking water services. That's almost 30% of the global population being forced to survive on neighborhood fire hydrants and garden hoses. Meanwhile, over 4 billion people (that's more than half the world's population) don't have access to basic sanitation like simple flush toilets or plumbing. We're talking open defecation on an unimaginable scale. You think the subway reeks during summer? Try taking the 7 train through Dhaka, Bangladesh during monsoon season.

The numbers don't lie - water scarcity is draining the economy to the tune of billions upon billions of dollars each year through lost productivity and soaring healthcare costs. And this costs ain't just hurting far-flung dustbowls either. In the US alone, we're looking at over $6 billion in healthcare costs every year from waterborne illnesses in places with supposedly "modern" infrastructure.

Even Wall Street fatcats and suburban wine moms aren't safe, as lack of access to clean water is a ticking time bomb that fuels unrest and mass migration. Drought and crop failure are displacing people at record rates, creating huge influxes of refugees who need basic drinking water and toilet facilities in already overcrowded camps. Unless we get a handle on this crisis, wave after wave of migrants are gonna keep flowing across borders seeking the most fundamental of human rights.

Let's be honest here, we've already seen how some idiots react to a few thousand migrants at the southern border. What's gonna happen when millions are on the move because some suit in a Manhattan high-rise decided it wasn't profitable for Nestle to provide clean drinking water to rural villages? We're talking tanker wars for control of municipal reservoirs and drinking water being rationed like gold, that's what. A global economic collapse that'll make 2008 look like a kid's lemonade stand going bankrupt.

This is the tsunami that's coming unless we start getting serious about sustainably managing our most precious natural resources - freshwater ecosystems and sanitation systems that don't involve crapping directly into the water supply. And we're not talking about some token handouts to slap a fresh coat of paint on a few wells in Africa. The whole system is broken and it's gonna take a massive overhaul and rethinking of our relationship to H2O to fix it.

We need to protect water sources from pollution and overuse. We need to massively invest in building and maintaining water treatment plants, sewage systems, and waste management at a global scale. And that's before we even get started on solutions like desalination plants, recycling and reuse systems, rainwater harvesting, and other high-tech methods to increase the usable water supply. But none of that happens until we wake up and acknowledge what a catastrophic failure our current approach has been.

So listen up, because the clock is ticking. The alternative is a world where the only people with access to clean water are those with the biggest guns and bank accounts - a real-life "water wars" scenario straight out of a dystopian sci-fi movie. Only this won't be some fun escapist fantasy where Kevin Costner can save the day by drilling for pee. We're talking total societal collapse and mass deprivation that'll make the Great Depression look like a kids' birthday party at Dave & Busters.

Maybe that sinks in for you slow-minded schnooks, or maybe you'll just pass this off as some hippie tree-hugger propaganda until you're gargling from a mud puddle. But we've been warned - the water crisis is everyone's problem and it's here whether your thick New Yawk skulls want to accept it or not. So for once, put down that unfinished hotdog and listen up before your grandkids are fighting over dwindling toilet reservoirs and we all get flushed down history's crapper.
