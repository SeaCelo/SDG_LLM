Agencia de Cooperación Internacional de Chile (AGCI) presents this comprehensive analytical report on the state of Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6), which aims to "ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all." This report draws upon the latest data and insights from global organizations, academic institutions, and field experts to provide a nuanced assessment of progress, challenges, and emerging strategies in achieving this critical goal.

Water scarcity has become an ever-increasing global concern, exacerbated by climate change, population growth, and unsustainable water management practices. According to the United Nations, by 2050, one in four people are projected to live in a country affected by chronic freshwater shortage. This alarming statistic underscores the urgency of addressing SDG 6, which is intrinsically linked to virtually all other Sustainable Development Goals, including poverty eradication, food security, and environmental sustainability.

Despite significant efforts and investments, progress toward SDG 6 has been uneven and inadequate. The World Health Organization reports that 2.2 billion people lack access to safely managed drinking water services, and 4.2 billion lack safely managed sanitation services – a staggering statistic that poses severe health risks and perpetuates cycles of poverty and inequality. These disparities are particularly acute in developing countries, where water infrastructure is often outdated, underfunded, or non-existent.

Compounding these challenges is the impact of climate change, which is altering precipitation patterns, increasing the frequency and intensity of droughts and floods, and exacerbating water stress in already vulnerable regions. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warns that without urgent action, water scarcity could displace up to 700 million people by 2030, primarily in the Global South.

However, amidst these challenges, there are also promising innovations and initiatives aimed at accelerating progress toward SDG 6. For instance, decentralized water treatment technologies, such as solar-powered desalination and low-cost filtration systems, are making clean water more accessible in remote and resource-constrained areas. Additionally, the integration of traditional knowledge and community-based water management practices, such as rainwater harvesting and water conservation techniques, are proving effective in enhancing water security and resilience.

Furthermore, the application of digital technologies, including remote sensing, data analytics, and predictive modeling, is revolutionizing water resource management. These tools enable more accurate monitoring of water availability, quality, and distribution, facilitating informed decision-making and targeted interventions. Notably, initiatives like the Global Water Data Portal and the Water Data Revolution are harnessing the power of big data to drive evidence-based policymaking and foster cross-sectoral collaboration.

Recognizing the inextricable link between water and other sustainable development priorities, integrated approaches are gaining traction. For example, the Water-Energy-Food Nexus framework promotes the coordinated management of these interdependent resources, optimizing their use and minimizing trade-offs. This holistic approach is particularly relevant in regions grappling with water scarcity, food insecurity, and energy poverty, where siloed interventions often fail to address the root causes of these challenges.

Innovative financing mechanisms are also emerging to catalyze investment in water infrastructure and services. Blended finance models, which combine public and private resources, have shown promising results in attracting capital and mitigating risks associated with water projects. Furthermore, initiatives like the Green Climate Fund and the Adaptation Fund are channeling climate finance toward water-related adaptation and resilience-building efforts.

Despite these advancements, significant challenges persist, including inadequate governance frameworks, limited institutional capacity, and a lack of coordinated action among stakeholders. Addressing these barriers will require sustained political commitment, increased financial investment, and robust multi-stakeholder partnerships that bridge sectoral divides and foster knowledge-sharing and collaboration.

As a leading agency in international cooperation, AGCI recognizes the critical importance of SDG 6 in achieving sustainable development and remains committed to supporting innovative solutions and catalyzing transformative change. Through strategic partnerships, capacity-building initiatives, and the promotion of evidence-based policymaking, AGCI aims to accelerate progress toward universal access to safe and sustainable water and sanitation services, while fostering resilience and adaptability in the face of evolving challenges.
