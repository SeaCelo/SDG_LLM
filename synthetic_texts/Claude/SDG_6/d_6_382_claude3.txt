The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) presents this analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) â€“ Clean Water and Sanitation. Ensuring access to water and sanitation for all is a profound challenge that intersects with numerous developmental priorities, including poverty alleviation, health, education, gender equality, and environmental sustainability.

Water scarcity is a pressing global issue, exacerbated by climate change, population growth, urbanization, and unsustainable consumption patterns. By 2050, at least one in four people is likely to live in a country affected by chronic or recurring fresh water shortages. This has grave implications for food security, economic development, and social stability. Alarmingly, water use has outpaced population growth, and global water demand is projected to increase by nearly one-third by 2050.

Access to safe drinking water remains a formidable challenge, particularly in rural areas and informal urban settlements. Globally, 1 in 3 people lack access to safely managed drinking water services, and 2 out of 5 people lack basic handwashing facilities with soap and water. The burden of collecting water disproportionately falls on women and girls, perpetuating gender inequalities and hindering their educational and economic opportunities.

Inadequate sanitation is a critical public health issue, contributing to the spread of waterborne diseases and undermining human dignity. Globally, 3.6 billion people lack access to safely managed sanitation facilities, with the highest burden in sub-Saharan Africa and Central and Southern Asia. Open defecation, a practice that compromises water quality and human health, remains prevalent in many regions, with devastating impacts on maternal and child health.

Water pollution is a severe environmental and public health concern, driven by industrial effluents, untreated sewage, agricultural runoff, and inadequate waste management. Globally, over 80% of wastewater is discharged into the environment without adequate treatment, contaminating freshwater sources and coastal ecosystems. This not only threatens aquatic life and biodiversity but also poses risks to human health and exacerbates water scarcity.

Climate change is exacerbating water-related challenges, contributing to droughts, floods, and the degradation of water resources. Rising sea levels and saltwater intrusion threaten freshwater supplies in coastal areas, while glacier melt and changes in precipitation patterns disrupt water availability and quality in many regions.

Achieving SDG 6 requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the interrelated challenges of water scarcity, sanitation, pollution, and climate change. Integrated water resources management, involving all stakeholders and sectors, is crucial for ensuring sustainable and equitable water use. This includes investing in water infrastructure, promoting water efficiency, and protecting and restoring water-related ecosystems.

Expanding access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation services, particularly in rural and informal urban areas, is imperative. This requires substantial investments, innovative financing mechanisms, and community-driven approaches that empower local populations. Additionally, addressing the gender dimensions of water and sanitation is critical, as women and girls often bear the brunt of water collection and are disproportionately affected by inadequate sanitation facilities.

Combating water pollution necessitates robust regulations, improved wastewater treatment, and the adoption of sustainable agricultural and industrial practices. Promoting circular economy principles, waste minimization, and recycling can significantly reduce the discharge of pollutants into water bodies.

Adapting to the impacts of climate change on water resources is essential, requiring climate-resilient infrastructure, improved water storage and distribution systems, and the adoption of drought-resistant crops and water-efficient irrigation techniques. Protecting and restoring water-related ecosystems, such as wetlands and watersheds, can enhance natural water storage and purification capacities while supporting biodiversity conservation.

International cooperation, knowledge sharing, and technology transfer are vital for addressing transboundary water challenges and supporting developing countries in achieving SDG 6. Strengthening institutional capacity, governance frameworks, and stakeholder engagement is crucial for effective water resources management and ensuring equitable access to water and sanitation services.

Achieving SDG 6 is not only a moral imperative but also a prerequisite for sustainable development, as water underpins nearly every aspect of human life, economic activity, and ecosystem functioning. By addressing the complex and interconnected challenges of water scarcity, sanitation, pollution, and climate change, we can unlock immense social, economic, and environmental benefits, paving the way for a more equitable, resilient, and sustainable future for all.
