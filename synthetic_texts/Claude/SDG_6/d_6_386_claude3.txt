The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) presents this analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6): Clean Water and Sanitation. This goal aims to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all by 2030. Despite significant progress, challenges persist, particularly in regions grappling with conflict, displacement, and climate change.

Globally, an estimated 2.2 billion people lack access to safely managed drinking water services, and 4.2 billion lack safely managed sanitation services. These deficits disproportionately impact marginalized communities, exacerbating existing inequalities. In humanitarian crises, water and sanitation infrastructure are often compromised, leading to outbreaks of waterborne diseases and heightened protection risks, especially for women and girls.

The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical importance of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services in preventing disease transmission and sustaining public health. However, the pandemic has also strained already limited resources and disrupted supply chains, leaving many communities without access to these essential services.

Climate change poses a significant threat to water security, with rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and more frequent extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods, impacting water availability and quality. Low-lying coastal areas and small island developing states are particularly vulnerable to saltwater intrusion and sea-level rise, exacerbating water scarcity and contamination.

Conflicts and protracted crises have a devastating impact on WASH infrastructure, disrupting services and hampering maintenance and repair efforts. In Yemen, for instance, the prolonged conflict has left over 16 million people without access to safe water and sanitation, contributing to the world's worst cholera outbreak.

Addressing these challenges requires a multi-faceted approach that integrates humanitarian response, sustainable development, and climate action. OCHA is working closely with partners to prioritize WASH interventions in emergency settings, including the provision of safe water, sanitation facilities, and hygiene promotion activities.

Innovative solutions are being explored, such as the use of solar-powered water treatment systems and the rehabilitation of existing infrastructure. Community-based approaches that engage local stakeholders and promote sustainable water resource management are also proving effective in building resilience and ensuring long-term solutions.

Addressing water scarcity and improving sanitation requires significant investment in infrastructure, capacity building, and policy reforms. Effective governance and coordination among stakeholders, including governments, civil society, and the private sector, are crucial to ensuring equitable access and sustainable management of water resources.

In conclusion, achieving SDG 6 remains a critical challenge, particularly in the context of humanitarian crises, climate change, and protracted conflicts. OCHA, in collaboration with partners, is committed to prioritizing WASH interventions and promoting sustainable solutions that address the root causes of water scarcity and inadequate sanitation. By integrating humanitarian response, sustainable development, and climate action, we can collectively work towards ensuring access to clean water and sanitation for all.
