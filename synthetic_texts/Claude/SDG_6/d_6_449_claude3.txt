Tearfund's Analytical Report on SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation

As a global humanitarian organization committed to addressing systemic poverty, Tearfund recognizes the pivotal role of clean water and sanitation in achieving sustainable development. SDG 6 aims to "ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all," a monumental challenge that intersects with various socio-economic, environmental, and governance factors.

The statistics paint a sobering picture: according to the World Health Organization, one in three people globally lacks access to safe drinking water, while two out of five lack basic sanitation facilities. This crisis is particularly acute in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia, where water scarcity, inadequate infrastructure, and poor hygiene practices perpetuate a vicious cycle of poverty, disease, and stunted development.

Tearfund's on-the-ground experiences underscore the multidimensional nature of this challenge. In rural areas, women and children often bear the physical burden of fetching water from distant sources, compromising their health, safety, and educational opportunities. In urban slums, overcrowding and lack of sewage systems exacerbate the spread of waterborne diseases like cholera, diarrhea, and typhoid, which claim countless lives annually.

However, the water crisis is not solely a matter of infrastructure deficits. It is intrinsically linked to broader issues of governance, climate change, and resource management. In regions plagued by conflict or political instability, water infrastructure is often targeted or neglected, disrupting essential services and displacing vulnerable populations. Climate change exacerbates water stress through prolonged droughts, unpredictable rainfall patterns, and the depletion of freshwater sources due to rising sea levels and glacial melt.

Tearfund's approach to addressing SDG 6 is grounded in a holistic, community-driven model that recognizes the interconnectedness of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) with other development goals. Our interventions prioritize capacity-building, empowering local communities to take ownership of their water resources and sanitation facilities. This includes training community members in sustainable water management practices, such as rainwater harvesting, groundwater recharge, and the construction and maintenance of low-cost, eco-friendly sanitation solutions.

Alongside infrastructure development, Tearfund places a strong emphasis on hygiene education and behavior change campaigns. By fostering a culture of good hygiene practices, including handwashing, safe water storage, and proper waste disposal, we aim to break the transmission cycle of waterborne diseases and promote lasting behavioral shifts.

Furthermore, Tearfund recognizes the inextricable link between water and gender equality. Women and girls disproportionately bear the burden of water scarcity, often sacrificing educational and economic opportunities to fulfill their water collection responsibilities. By involving women in the planning, implementation, and management of WASH initiatives, we empower them as decision-makers and catalyze broader societal transformations.

Collaborative partnerships are central to Tearfund's approach, fostering synergies with local governments, international organizations, and private sector actors. We advocate for inclusive, transparent, and accountable water governance frameworks that prioritize the needs of marginalized communities and ensure equitable access to water resources.

In the face of climate change, Tearfund promotes climate-resilient water solutions, such as drought-resistant crops, efficient irrigation systems, and the protection of critical watersheds and wetlands. By integrating climate adaptation strategies into our WASH interventions, we aim to build community resilience and safeguard water resources for future generations.

Achieving SDG 6 requires a concerted global effort that transcends sectoral boundaries and national borders. Tearfund remains committed to collaborating with diverse stakeholders, leveraging innovative technologies, and advocating for policy reforms that prioritize universal access to clean water and sanitation as a fundamental human right and a cornerstone of sustainable development.
