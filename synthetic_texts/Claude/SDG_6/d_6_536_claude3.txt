The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6, which aims to "ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all," presents a unique and multifaceted challenge for the business community. Access to clean water and sanitation is not only a fundamental human right but also a critical enabler for economic growth, social progress, and environmental sustainability. As the Journal of Business Venturing, we recognize the pivotal role that entrepreneurship and innovative business models can play in addressing this global issue.

Water scarcity, pollution, and inadequate sanitation infrastructure pose significant risks to businesses across various sectors, from agriculture and manufacturing to tourism and healthcare. These challenges can disrupt supply chains, increase operational costs, and undermine the well-being of employees and local communities. Conversely, businesses that proactively address water and sanitation challenges can unlock new opportunities, enhance their social license to operate, and contribute to long-term value creation.

Innovative business models and entrepreneurial solutions have the potential to drive transformative change in water and sanitation management. For instance, decentralized and off-grid water treatment technologies, such as solar-powered desalination and filtration systems, can provide access to clean water in remote or underserved areas. Social enterprises focused on developing affordable and locally-appropriate sanitation solutions, such as eco-friendly toilets and wastewater treatment systems, can improve hygiene and public health outcomes.

Moreover, the advent of digital technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), remote sensing, and data analytics, has opened up new frontiers for water resource management. Entrepreneurs can leverage these technologies to develop smart water metering systems, leak detection algorithms, and predictive maintenance solutions, thereby enhancing water efficiency and reducing waste.

Collaborative efforts between businesses, governments, and civil society organizations are crucial for scaling up these innovative solutions and accelerating progress towards SDG 6. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) can facilitate the development of sustainable water infrastructure, such as wastewater treatment plants and distribution networks. Additionally, impact investing and blended finance models can mobilize private capital for water and sanitation projects, bridging the funding gap and ensuring long-term financial sustainability.

Furthermore, businesses can integrate water stewardship principles into their operations and supply chains, promoting responsible water use, investing in water-efficient technologies, and supporting local water conservation efforts. By doing so, they not only contribute to SDG 6 but also enhance their resilience to water-related risks and secure their long-term operational viability.

However, it is crucial to acknowledge the complex interplay between water, sanitation, and other SDGs, such as SDG 1 (No Poverty), SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being), SDG 5 (Gender Equality), and SDG 13 (Climate Action). For instance, improving access to safe water and sanitation can reduce the burden of water-borne diseases, leading to better health outcomes and increased economic productivity. Additionally, women and girls often bear the disproportionate burden of collecting water, and improved access to water and sanitation can empower them and promote gender equality.

In conclusion, achieving SDG 6 requires a paradigm shift in how we value, manage, and govern water resources. Entrepreneurship and innovative business models have the potential to drive this transformation, unlocking new solutions and mobilizing resources at scale. By embracing water stewardship principles and collaborating with stakeholders across sectors, businesses can not only mitigate water-related risks but also create shared value and contribute to a more sustainable and equitable future.
