Here is a detailed newspaper article about Sustainable Development Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), written from the perspective of Fortune magazine:

The Next Resource Crisis: Can the World Solve the Coming Water Scarcity?

By 2050, over half the global population could face water scarcity—a nightmare scenario with profound humanitarian, economic, and geopolitical consequences. As the world grapples with the existential threat of climate change, another crisis is brewing, one that could derail progress on nearly every other sustainable development priority. We're talking, of course, about water.

The statistics are staggering: Over 2 billion people lack access to safely managed drinking water, while twice that many lack access to adequate sanitation facilities. Each year, 485,000 children under 5 die from diarrhea linked to unsafe water and poor sanitation. It's a crisis disproportionately impacting the world's poorest, exacerbating inequality, marginalizing vulnerable populations, and suppressing economic potential.

Yet the challenge extends far beyond questions of access: Agriculture accounts for 70% of global freshwater withdrawals today, and demand is only increasing as the planet's population grows. Industrial uses, including energy production, manufacturing, and resource extraction, claim another 20% of supply. Climate change is further destabilizing the hydrologic cycle, fueling floods, droughts, and uncertain precipitation patterns that threaten water security in regions across the globe.

The consequences are almost incalculable. Crop failures and famine, forced migration and conflict over dwindling resources, entrenched poverty and disease—these secondary impacts have the potential to upend societies and destabilize entire regions. Water scarcity poses an existential threat to many industries as well, from energy and agriculture to consumer goods and heavy manufacturing.

There are no simple solutions, but decisive action is imperative. We need a holistic approach that values and conserves this critical resource while expanding sustainable access for all.

That means dramatically improving water use efficiency across sectors. In agriculture, transitioning to precision irrigation, drought-resistant crops, and sustainable practices like drip irrigation and rainwater harvesting. In industry, investing in water recycling, waste treatment, and smarter cooling technologies. At the consumer level, upgrading infrastructure to reduce leaks and incentivizing conservation.

At the same time, we must expand access to safely managed sanitation services for the billions still lacking, while addressing pollution from untreated wastewater. The costs are daunting but pale in comparison to the costs of crisis and conflict. And new decentralized technologies like low-cost filters, solar disinfection, and off-grid desalination offer immense potential.

Cooperation on shared water resources will also be critical as competition over limited sources like rivers and aquifers increases. From the Nile to the Euphrates to the Indus, enhanced governance is needed to peacefully manage these transboundary waters and avoid inflaming regional tensions. International frameworks and protocols must be strengthened and expanded.

Innovative financing models that treat water as a precious asset worthy of investment are key as well. That means expanding microloans for household purification and sanitation access, while pooling resources from public, private, and philanthropic sources to upgrade and climate-proof essential infrastructure. New insurance products and financial instruments that incentivize conservation and value water as a risk factor will also be vital tools.

The global community has recognized water scarcity as an urgent priority, as enshrined in the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 6. But on our current trajectory, we are falling far short. 

With unyielding vision, innovative thinking, and transformative investment, averting this crisis is achievable. But the costs of complacency would be catastrophic. For business, society, and the global economy, water scarcity is the next great challenge we cannot afford to ignore.
