The Great Unwashed: How Corporate Greed is Draining the World Dry

By Tina Dupuy

Water is life. It's the most precious resource on this planet, making up over 70% of the Earth's surface. And yet, billions of people lack access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation services. The global water crisis is a slow-moving disaster compounded by corporate avarice, inept governance, and the ravages of climate change. If we don't act now to protect and conserve our freshwater sources, the consequences will be catastrophic.

The statistics are grim: 1 in 3 people lack access to safely managed drinking water. An estimated 2 billion people use water sources contaminated with feces. Nearly half of the global population lacks safe sanitation. Every year, hundreds of thousands die from diarrheal diseases caused by unsafe water and poor sanitation hygiene—most of them children. Meanwhile, behemoth agribusinesses like Nestlé are sucking aquifers dry to sell bottled water back to the masses. It's a twisted form of disaster capitalism profiting off of human suffering.

Nowhere is this water insecurity more evident than in the Global South, where water tables are being depleted at unsustainable rates. The world's neediest already struggle with food and resource shortages compounded by war, poverty and climate-related droughts. With population growth and urbanization booming in developing nations, pressure on dwindling freshwater supplies has become untenable. 

This precarious scenario is made exponentially worse by the destabilizing force of climate change. Rising temperatures are increasing evaporation rates and creating longer, more intense droughts. Glaciers and polar ice sheets are melting rapidly, disrupting precipitation patterns. Climate-fueled conflicts over scarce water resources threaten to create waves of water refugees. We are already seeing this play out across the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Without drastic action, water-related calamities could displace over 700 million people by 2030.

And who is most responsible for accelerating this global water emergency? The fossil fuel tycoons and their political marionettes who have waged a War on Science for decades, obstructing sustainability efforts at every turn. The corporate robber barons fracking for natural gas and contaminating groundwater sources across America. Agribusiness giants like Monsanto stripping lands of biodiversity and nutrients through monoculture farming. Cattle barons clear-cutting the Amazon rainforest to expand grazing ranges. It's a vicious cabal of capitalistic ecocide.

Not all cultures have such a cavalier disregard for water conservation. Many indigenous peoples have time-honored traditions of protecting water sources dating back millennia.In North America, indigenous tribes are on the frontlines defending watersheds from exploitation by mining, agribusiness and resource extraction companies. They understand that clean water is a sacred public trust to be revered—not a commodity to pillage for private profit.

These are the guardians of sustainability we should heed as planet-wide droughts intensify. We have the technological ingenuity to transform human waste into fertilizer. We can expand rainwater harvesting and greywater recycling infrastructure. With more investment in desalination and wastewater treatment facilities, we can create a circular sanitation economy. Such innovations are key to achieving the UN's goal of universal access to clean water and sanitation services.  

Yet in this era of deregulation and austerity, public funding for water infrastructure has been decimated. Control over municipal water systems is increasingly being handed over to private equity firms and corporate monopolies like Suez and Veolia. In cities like Atlanta, Detroit and Baltimore, unaffordable water rates have forced untold numbers into water poverty. Price-gouging is only compounded by aging, neglected sewage and pipe networks that leak over 2 trillion gallons annually. It's a perfect storm of environmental racism and capitalistic plunder.

But communities are fighting back against privatization schemes and withholding water as a human right. From Flint to El Salvador, grassroots campaigners have scored hard-won victories keeping water services under public control. We must build on this momentum toward a more localized, democratized, and sustainability-centered approach to water management.

Four-fifths of the world's population faces looming water scarcity. The time to implement holistic solutions is rapidly evaporating. It will require regulating corporate water overexploitation, investing in green infrastructure, empowering indigenous stewardship, and treating water access as an inviolable public good—not a profit-maximizing scheme. If we fail to reckon with the corporate forces draining our most vital resources, those most responsible will sip from bottled oases while the great unwashed masses go thirsty. Upholding the human right to clean water and sanitation demands nothing less than toppling the oligarchs whose greed perpetuates this growing crisis.
