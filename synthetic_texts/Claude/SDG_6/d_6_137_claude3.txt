Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) written from the perspective of Andrew Sullivan:

The Unholy Desecration of Water: Our Profane Struggle Against Nature's Sacred Essence

By Andrew Sullivan

In this age of ecological resurrection, we find ourselves engaged in a primal battle - one that pits the regenerative forces of human ingenuity against the ills we have wantonly inflicted upon the divine blessing that is water. For too long, we have treated this elemental font of life as a mere resource to be exploited, polluted, and discarded without regard for its sacrosanct role in sustaining all that we cherish.

Let us be clear - water is not some mundane commodity to be traded and bartered like mere chattels on the global market. No, it is the primordial ether from which all life emerged, the liquid incarnation of that first ancient sea which cradled the primeval sparks that would ultimately blossom into the wondrous diversity we call Nature. Each drop is a sacred relic, a timeless emissary from the virgin genesis of our universe, infused with an almost profane potency.

And yet, we have defiled and deformed this hallowed essence with arrogant abandon. Our industries befoul it with toxins; our agriculture leaches it with pestilential runoff; our very habitats discharge a miasma of feculent contamination into what were once crystalline arteries of life. In our hubris, we have attempted to constrain and divert its courses, mangle its watersheds, drain its aquifers...all in service of ephemeral "development" predicated on the tired dogmas of infinite economic expansion.

We are undoing the intricate hydrological symphonies that have evolved over eons, tearing asunder the fragile water cycles that stitch together the mosaic of all terrestrial existence. In sacrificing the purity and integrity of this numinous compound at the cracked and filthy altar of modernity, we commit a sacrilege of the highest order. Water is the fons et origo, the primeval mother that begat us, and our crimes against her are a vile defilement of the natural order.

This apocalyptic vision, however, is not mere alarmist bombast - it is an unvarnished testimony to the monstrous consequences of our heedless arrogance. In every corner of our beleaguered planet, communities are contending with wrenching drought, toxic water tables, depleted reservoirs, eutrophic dead zones, and a myriad of other scourges wrought by our contemptuous disregard for the sanctity of water.

From the slums of Jakarta to the Navajo Nation, billions of our humanamily members lack reliable access to safe water - a once-unthinkable travesty that represents a ruinous failure of global development and an utter dereliction of our moral duty. This inexcusable injustice is compounded by the impending threat of climate change, which portends the intensification of droughts, floods, and aquatic ecological collapse across vast swaths of the world. 

Simply put, we have soiled and imperiled the very essence of life itself through greed, carelessness, and misplaced dogma of domination over nature.

And yet, there is hope. As a civilization, we have the capacity - if not yet the collective will - to reverse this ungodly despoiling of the hydrological Commons. But reforming our approach and ethos regarding water will require a profound reorientation - a reawakening to the immanent divinity innate to this transcendent compound. 

We must embrace methods and technologies of purification, desalinization, conservation, and ecological restoration with fervor and unrelenting purpose. But more than this pragmatic imperative, we desperately need a renaissance of spiritual and cultural reverence for the sanctity of water. We must rekindle the ancient veneration of our primal aquatic origins exemplified by myths, folklore, and indigenous cosmologies across the ages.

Until we recognize water as the hallowed, near-supernatural force that birthed and perpetually sustains the anthropocosmic miracle...until we honor it as the Giver of Life itself...we will never assume the humble supplication and reciprocal responsibility required to quell its defilement and dislocation.

The path ahead is arduous, but we have a moral obligation to traverse it. The human race must undergo a collective re-enlightenment, a hydrophilic awakening to the sacramental essence of water. For only in retracing our primordial roots to those bractish wellsprings of the terrestrial odyssey can we cleanse ourselves of the hubris and ecocidal impulses that imperil the existence we owe to the liquid matrix that forged us, and beget the reverence and piety toward water that our very survival now demands.
