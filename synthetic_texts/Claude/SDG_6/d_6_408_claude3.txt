The Agency of International Cooperation for Development presents this analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6), which aims to "ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all." This goal is critical for addressing the global water crisis and promoting equitable access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services.

Globally, around 2 billion people lack access to safely managed drinking water services, and 3.6 billion lack access to safely managed sanitation facilities. Water scarcity affects more than 40% of the global population, and this situation is expected to worsen due to climate change, population growth, and rapid urbanization. The lack of WASH services disproportionately impacts marginalized communities, exacerbating existing inequalities and hindering social and economic development.

SDG 6 recognizes the inextricable link between water and sustainable development, as water is essential for human health, food production, energy generation, and ecosystem preservation. Achieving this goal requires a multifaceted approach involving policy reforms, infrastructure development, capacity building, and international cooperation.

One of the key targets of SDG 6 is to achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030. This involves expanding and improving water supply systems, particularly in rural and urban slum areas. Strategies such as rainwater harvesting, desalination, and wastewater reuse can help address water scarcity in arid and semi-arid regions. Additionally, improving water resource management through integrated water resources management (IWRM) approaches is crucial for ensuring sustainable withdrawals and supply.

Another critical target is to achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation by 2030. This involves investing in sanitation infrastructure, such as sewage systems, decentralized wastewater treatment solutions, and safe disposal facilities. Community-led total sanitation (CLTS) initiatives have proven effective in promoting behavior change and increasing demand for improved sanitation facilities.

Addressing water scarcity and improving water quality are also essential components of SDG 6. Strategies like water demand management, pollution control, ecosystem restoration, and transboundary water cooperation can help mitigate water scarcity and improve water quality. For instance, the Senegal River Basin Development Authority (OMVS) has facilitated cooperation among riparian countries, promoting sustainable water resource management and economic development in the region.

Furthermore, SDG 6 emphasizes the protection and restoration of water-related ecosystems, such as wetlands, rivers, aquifers, and lakes. These ecosystems provide vital services like water purification, flood control, and biodiversity conservation. Initiatives like the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands and the Living Rivers Approach aim to support the conservation and sustainable use of these ecosystems.

Achieving SDG 6 requires substantial financial resources, technological innovation, and capacity building. The estimated investment needed to achieve universal access to WASH services is around $114 billion per year until 2030. Innovative financing mechanisms, such as blended finance and public-private partnerships, can help bridge the funding gap. Additionally, strengthening institutional and human resource capacities through education, training, and knowledge sharing is essential for effective implementation and sustainable management of water resources.

International cooperation and partnerships are crucial for addressing transboundary water challenges, sharing best practices, and mobilizing resources. Initiatives like the United Nations World Water Development Report and the Global Water Partnership facilitate knowledge exchange, promote policy dialogue, and support capacity building efforts.

In conclusion, SDG 6 is a critical goal that underpins sustainable development across various sectors. Achieving universal and equitable access to safe water and sanitation, managing water scarcity, improving water quality, protecting water-related ecosystems, and fostering international cooperation are essential for addressing the global water crisis and promoting human well-being, economic prosperity, and environmental sustainability.
