The European Investment Bank (EIB) recognizes the critical importance of Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) in ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. As a leading financial institution, the EIB is committed to supporting projects and initiatives that address the multifaceted challenges associated with this goal.

Water scarcity and inadequate access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities continue to be pressing issues globally, particularly in developing regions. The impact of climate change, population growth, urbanization, and unsustainable agricultural practices exacerbate these challenges, leading to increased water stress, degradation of water resources, and the perpetuation of water-borne diseases.

In this context, the EIB's investment strategy for SDG 6 is multidimensional, encompassing a range of interventions across various sectors. One key area of focus is the development of sustainable water infrastructure, including the construction and rehabilitation of water treatment plants, distribution networks, and wastewater treatment facilities. The Bank recognizes the importance of leveraging innovative technologies, such as membrane filtration, advanced oxidation processes, and decentralized treatment systems, to enhance water quality and efficiency.

Furthermore, the EIB supports projects that promote integrated water resource management (IWRM) practices. This approach recognizes the interconnectedness of water resources and the need for coordinated management across sectors, regions, and stakeholders. IWRM initiatives funded by the Bank include the development of river basin management plans, the establishment of robust water governance frameworks, and the implementation of measures to address water scarcity and drought mitigation.

In the agricultural sector, the EIB is actively engaged in financing projects that promote sustainable water use and management. This includes investments in efficient irrigation systems, such as drip irrigation and precision agriculture technologies, as well as initiatives that support the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices. By optimizing water use and reducing water pollution from agricultural runoff, these projects contribute to the preservation of water resources and the long-term sustainability of food production systems.

Moreover, the Bank recognizes the inextricable link between water and sanitation, and its investments reflect this interconnectedness. The EIB supports the development of comprehensive sanitation infrastructure, including the construction of sewage treatment plants, the rehabilitation of aging sewerage networks, and the implementation of decentralized sanitation solutions in remote and underserved areas. These investments not only improve access to basic sanitation services but also contribute to the protection of water resources by reducing the discharge of untreated wastewater.

To further catalyze progress towards SDG 6, the EIB actively engages in capacity-building initiatives and knowledge-sharing platforms. By collaborating with local authorities, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders, the Bank facilitates the transfer of technical expertise, promotes best practices, and supports the development of robust governance and regulatory frameworks essential for sustainable water and sanitation management.

The EIB's investment strategy for SDG 6 is underpinned by a strong commitment to environmental sustainability, social responsibility, and economic viability. Projects funded by the Bank undergo rigorous environmental and social impact assessments to ensure their alignment with international standards and best practices. Additionally, the Bank promotes the involvement of local communities and stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle, fostering ownership, transparency, and accountability.

To illustrate the impact of the EIB's investments, consider the Bank's support for the Danube River Basin Rehabilitation Program. This multi-year initiative aims to improve water quality, enhance flood protection, and promote sustainable water resource management across the Danube River Basin, which spans multiple countries and serves as a vital water source for millions of people. The program involves the construction of wastewater treatment plants, the restoration of natural floodplains, and the implementation of integrated river basin management plans. By addressing water pollution, mitigating flood risks, and promoting transboundary cooperation, this initiative exemplifies the EIB's holistic approach to tackling the challenges associated with SDG 6.

Another notable example is the EIB's involvement in the Sustainable Water Integrated Management and Horizon 2020 Support Mechanism (SWIM-H2020 SM) project in the Mediterranean region. This project aims to promote the sustainable use of water resources, enhance water supply and sanitation services, and strengthen regional cooperation and capacity-building efforts. Through technical assistance, knowledge transfer, and the dissemination of best practices, the SWIM-H2020 SM project supports the implementation of integrated water resource management strategies and the adoption of water-efficient technologies across the region.

As the world grapples with the intensifying challenges posed by water scarcity, pollution, and inadequate sanitation, the EIB remains steadfast in its commitment to SDG 6. By leveraging its financial resources, technical expertise, and collaborative partnerships, the Bank continues to drive innovative solutions and catalyze transformative change towards a water-secure and sustainable future for all.
