All We Can Methodist relief and development recognizes the pivotal role that SDG 6 – Clean Water and Sanitation – plays in the global pursuit of sustainable development. Access to safe water, adequate sanitation, and sound management of freshwater ecosystems are not only fundamental human rights but also catalysts for progress across numerous other SDGs.

Our analysis reveals a sobering reality: despite concerted efforts, the world remains alarmingly off-track in achieving SDG 6. Approximately 2 billion people worldwide lack access to safely managed drinking water services, while 3.6 billion lack access to safely managed sanitation facilities. This crisis disproportionately affects the most vulnerable populations, perpetuating cycles of poverty, poor health, and gender inequality.

In sub-Saharan Africa, where our organization has a significant presence, the situation is particularly dire. Only 24% of the population has access to safely managed drinking water, and a mere 28% has access to safely managed sanitation services. The implications are far-reaching, with water-related diseases like cholera, diarrhea, and malnutrition claiming countless lives, particularly among children under five.

Moreover, the mismanagement of water resources poses grave threats to ecosystems and biodiversity. Unsustainable withdrawals, pollution, and the effects of climate change have already pushed many freshwater systems to the brink of collapse. In regions like the Middle East and North Africa, water scarcity is a looming crisis, exacerbated by rapid population growth, urbanization, and economic development.

Addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach that spans infrastructure development, policy reforms, community engagement, and international cooperation. Investing in climate-resilient water and sanitation infrastructure, particularly in rural and marginalized communities, is paramount. This includes constructing and maintaining wells, boreholes, piped water systems, and decentralized wastewater treatment facilities.

However, infrastructure alone is insufficient. Effective water governance and management strategies are crucial. This entails strengthening institutional frameworks, promoting integrated water resource management (IWRM), and fostering transboundary cooperation for shared water resources. Policies must also incentivize water conservation, efficiency, and the adoption of circular economy principles in agriculture and industry.

Community engagement and empowerment are equally vital. Our experience has shown that involving local stakeholders, particularly women and marginalized groups, in the design, implementation, and maintenance of water and sanitation initiatives fosters ownership and long-term sustainability. Capacity-building programs that impart knowledge and skills related to water management, hygiene practices, and climate change adaptation are instrumental in this regard.

Furthermore, addressing the water crisis requires a concerted global effort. International cooperation, knowledge sharing, and technology transfer are paramount. Developed nations must fulfill their commitments to Official Development Assistance (ODA) and provide financial and technical support to developing countries. Innovative financing mechanisms, such as blended finance and public-private partnerships, can also catalyze investments in water and sanitation infrastructure.

As we approach the 2030 deadline for the SDGs, the urgency of achieving SDG 6 cannot be overstated. Without substantial progress, the ripple effects will reverberate across various development goals, jeopardizing efforts to eradicate poverty, improve health outcomes, promote gender equality, and mitigate the impacts of climate change. The path forward demands unwavering commitment, innovative solutions, and a collective resolve to ensure that access to clean water and sanitation is a reality for all.
