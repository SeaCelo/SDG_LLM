The Egyptian Agency for Partnership for Development presents this comprehensive analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6): Clean Water and Sanitation. This report delves into the intricacies of ensuring access to safe and affordable drinking water, adequate sanitation, and sound management of water resources in the Egyptian context.

Egypt, a nation straddling the arid expanse of North Africa and the fertile Nile Valley, faces unique challenges in achieving SDG 6. The country's primary water source, the Nile River, is a transboundary resource shared by multiple nations, necessitating intricate diplomatic negotiations and collaborative management strategies. Climate change exacerbates water scarcity, with rising temperatures and erratic precipitation patterns straining already-limited freshwater reserves.

Addressing the nation's water security is a multifaceted endeavor, requiring a holistic approach that considers the interplay of socioeconomic, environmental, and political factors. Egypt's rapidly growing population, projected to reach 128 million by 2050, amplifies the urgency for sustainable water management practices. Urbanization and industrialization further exacerbate water demand, necessitating innovative solutions to meet the needs of burgeoning cities and industries while minimizing environmental degradation.

The Egyptian government has implemented a range of initiatives to tackle water scarcity and ensure equitable access to clean water and sanitation. The National Water Resources Plan 2017-2037 outlines a comprehensive strategy for integrated water resources management, encompassing supply augmentation, demand management, and institutional reforms. Strategies such as desalination, wastewater reuse, and the adoption of water-efficient technologies in agriculture and industry aim to alleviate the strain on freshwater resources.

However, challenges persist in the realm of water infrastructure and service delivery. While Egypt has made significant strides in expanding access to improved water sources, with over 98% of the population enjoying such access, disparities exist between urban and rural areas. Rural communities often grapple with aging infrastructure, intermittent water supply, and water quality issues. Addressing these disparities requires targeted investments in infrastructure upgrades, maintenance, and capacity-building initiatives for local water service providers.

Sanitation remains a critical concern, with approximately 5% of the population lacking access to improved sanitation facilities. The inadequate management of wastewater and the discharge of untreated effluents pose significant risks to public health and the environment. Egypt's National Rural Sanitation Program and the Integrated Rural Sanitation in Upper Egypt project exemplify efforts to expand access to safe and hygienic sanitation services in underserved areas.

Furthermore, the agricultural sector, which accounts for approximately 80% of Egypt's total water consumption, necessitates a paradigm shift toward sustainable irrigation practices. Initiatives such as the National Drainage Program and the Integrated Water Resources Management Plan aim to enhance water-use efficiency, reduce soil salinization, and promote the adoption of modern irrigation techniques, including drip and sprinkler systems.

Achieving SDG 6 in Egypt requires a multidimensional approach that transcends mere infrastructure development. Institutional reforms, capacity-building, and stakeholder engagement are crucial components of the equation. The establishment of the Water Regulatory Agency and the National Water Resources Management Program exemplify efforts to strengthen governance frameworks and foster participatory decision-making processes.

Collaboration with international organizations, such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Bank, has facilitated knowledge-sharing, technical assistance, and financial support for water-related projects in Egypt. However, sustaining these partnerships and ensuring long-term financial commitments remains a challenge.

Looking ahead, Egypt's path to achieving SDG 6 will require a delicate balance between meeting the water demands of a growing populace, safeguarding environmental sustainability, and fostering regional cooperation on transboundary water resources management. Innovative approaches, such as the integration of nature-based solutions, the adoption of circular economy principles, and the leveraging of digital technologies, hold promise in unlocking new avenues for sustainable water management.

Ultimately, realizing the ambitious targets of SDG 6 in Egypt demands a concerted effort from all stakeholders â€“ government, private sector, civil society, and individual citizens. Raising awareness, promoting behavioral change, and fostering a culture of water conservation are imperative to ensure the long-term sustainability of Egypt's water resources and the well-being of its people.
