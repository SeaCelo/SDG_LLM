Compassion International's Analytical Report on Sustainable Development Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation

The global water crisis is a multifaceted challenge that demands immediate and concerted action. Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) aims to "ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all" by 2030. However, progress has been uneven, and significant disparities persist across regions, income levels, and demographic groups.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, where Compassion International has a strong presence, the water crisis is particularly acute. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 400 million people in the region lack access to basic drinking water services, and nearly 700 million lack access to basic sanitation facilities. This dire situation has far-reaching implications for public health, economic development, and overall human well-being.

The lack of access to clean water and sanitation disproportionately affects vulnerable populations, including children, women, and marginalized communities. Water-borne diseases, such as cholera, diarrhea, and dysentery, are leading causes of child mortality in the region. The burden of collecting water often falls on women and children, impeding their ability to pursue educational and economic opportunities.

Addressing the water crisis requires a multifaceted approach that considers the intricate interplay between water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH). Sustainable water management strategies must account for the impacts of climate change, population growth, urbanization, and agricultural practices on water resources. Innovative solutions, such as rainwater harvesting, desalination, and wastewater treatment, can help mitigate water scarcity and improve water quality.

Compassion International's efforts in this domain have yielded significant results. Through partnerships with local communities, governments, and other organizations, Compassion has implemented various interventions, including constructing water points, promoting hygiene education, and deploying sanitation facilities in schools and health centers.

For instance, in Burkina Faso, Compassion has collaborated with Water4 to construct water wells and provide hygiene training, benefiting over 50,000 individuals. In Ethiopia, Compassion's partnership with Water Is Life International has provided access to clean water for over 100,000 people. These initiatives have not only improved access to water and sanitation but have also fostered community ownership and empowerment.

However, challenges persist. Inadequate financing, weak governance structures, and limited institutional capacity often hinder progress. Compassion International recognizes the need for a holistic approach that encompasses advocacy, capacity building, and strategic partnerships to address these systemic barriers.

Compassion's advocacy efforts aim to influence policymakers and mobilize resources for WASH initiatives. By leveraging its global network and partnerships, Compassion can amplify the voices of marginalized communities and advocate for inclusive and sustainable water and sanitation policies.

Capacity building is another critical component of Compassion's strategy. By providing training and technical assistance to local organizations and communities, Compassion empowers them to manage water resources effectively, maintain infrastructure, and promote sustainable hygiene practices.

Strategic partnerships are crucial for maximizing impact and leveraging complementary expertise. Compassion collaborates with organizations specializing in areas such as water resource management, infrastructure development, and community engagement. These partnerships facilitate knowledge sharing, resource mobilization, and the implementation of integrated solutions.

Looking ahead, Compassion International recognizes the need for innovative approaches to address the water crisis. Embracing nature-based solutions, such as wetland restoration and watershed management, can help replenish groundwater resources and improve water quality. Additionally, integrating WASH interventions with other development initiatives, such as education, food security, and economic empowerment, can yield compounding benefits and accelerate progress towards multiple Sustainable Development Goals.

Achieving SDG 6 is a monumental challenge, but Compassion International remains committed to its mission of alleviating poverty and suffering. By fostering collaboration, leveraging innovative solutions, and empowering local communities, Compassion is well-positioned to contribute significantly to the global effort to ensure access to clean water and sanitation for all.
