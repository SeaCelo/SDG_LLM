The Crisis in Our Cups: An In-Depth Look at America's Drinking Water
By the Consumer Reports Investigative Team

When you turn on the tap for a glass of water, you likely don't give it a second thought. Access to safe, affordable drinking water is something most Americans take for granted.  However, our yearlong investigation has uncovered some startling truths that should make every consumer re-evaluate their water consumption habits.

First, the good news: Over 90% of the U.S. population is served by community water systems that meet federal health standards. But what constitutes those "standards" is where things get murky. The Safe Drinking Water Act, which regulates public water supplies, is woefully outdated. There are legal limits for only 91 contaminants, while the Environmental Protection Agency has compiled a list of over 90,000 chemicals used across the country. When you turn on the tap, you could be ingesting any number of unregulated substances.

Even for the regulated contaminants, allowable limits don't necessarily equate to safety. The legal threshold for lead, a neurotoxin, is based on a cost-benefit analysis rather than definitive health data. The same goes for chromium-6, the carcinogenic compound that was featured in the film Erin Brockovich. Rather than erring on the side of caution, agencies routinely set standards with economic factors as the priority.

In our tests of tap water from cities across the nation, we routinely found elevated levels of insidious chemicals like disinfection byproducts, pesticides, and even pharmaceuticals. While the Environmental Working Group's national Tap Water Database shows 81% of utility companies were in compliance, those results are based on annual tests that provide a limited snapshot. Independent studies have revealed more troubling contamination levels from additional sampling.

Water woes aren't just confined to the tap either. 18 million Americans receive their water from private wells, which are largely unregulated at the federal level. In rural areas, we found high occurrences of nitrates, arsenic, and fecal matter -- contaminants linked to cancer, developmental delays, and serious gastrointestinal issues.

Access presents another critical issue. Tens of millions lack affordable drinking water, whether due to aging infrastructure, poor service, or exorbitant utility costs. The COVID-19 pandemic made the gravity of this crisis abundantly clear, as basic handwashing became a privilege for many impoverished communities. We documented numerous cases of denied water restorals and surprise fees that created untenable financial burdens.

When it comes to bottled water, convenience often trumps common sense. Despite a premium price tag, the industry is essentially self-regulated by the FDA. Barely one-third of bottlers voluntarily utilize the minimum standards for municipal taps. Our tests detected an array of plastics, fungi, and bacteria in popular brands.

With both tap and bottled water presenting major risks, what is a prudent consumer to do? Investing in an at-home water treatment system is one obvious solution. However, selecting the proper filtration warrants careful research. Many pitcher filters only remove basic particulates, while reverse osmosis systems strip out beneficial minerals. Perhaps the most cost-effective approach is a comprehensive point-of-use filter that targets specific contaminants in your water supply.

Ultimately, solving America's drinking water crisis requires action on the regulatory front. From lobbying for more stringent controls to demanding publicly available data on local utilities, it's on all of us to prioritize this fundamental human right. After all, when it comes to water, being an educated consumer could be a matter of life or death.
