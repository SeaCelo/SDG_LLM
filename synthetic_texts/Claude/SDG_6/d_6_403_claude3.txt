The pursuit of Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) – ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all – has been a cornerstone of Catholic Relief Services' (CRS) global efforts to alleviate poverty and promote human dignity. As an organization deeply rooted in the principles of Catholic social teaching, CRS recognizes that access to clean water and adequate sanitation is not merely a technical issue but a fundamental human right intricately linked to the preservation of human life and the flourishing of communities.

CRS's multifaceted approach to SDG 6 is grounded in a comprehensive understanding of the intricate nexus between water, sanitation, and broader development challenges. Water scarcity, exacerbated by climate change, population growth, and unsustainable resource management, has severe implications for food security, health, and economic productivity. In regions plagued by water stress, such as the Sahel region of Africa and parts of South Asia, CRS has implemented innovative solutions that integrate water resource management with sustainable agricultural practices and climate change adaptation strategies.

One such initiative is the Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) program in Ethiopia, which has empowered local communities to develop and manage their water resources through participatory decision-making processes. By fostering collaboration among stakeholders, including government agencies, civil society organizations, and community members, the program has facilitated the construction of small-scale water infrastructure, such as rainwater harvesting systems and micro-irrigation schemes, while promoting sustainable land management practices to combat soil erosion and improve water retention.

Beyond addressing water scarcity, CRS has prioritized the provision of safe drinking water and adequate sanitation facilities, recognizing their critical role in preventing waterborne diseases and promoting public health. In urban slums and rural communities across Africa, Asia, and Latin America, CRS has partnered with local organizations to construct and rehabilitate water supply systems, install household water treatment solutions, and promote hygiene education programs. These efforts have been particularly impactful in regions affected by humanitarian crises, where the disruption of water and sanitation services can lead to outbreaks of cholera, diarrheal diseases, and other life-threatening conditions.

CRS's approach to SDG 6 is underpinned by a deep commitment to gender equality and women's empowerment. Women and girls often bear the disproportionate burden of water collection, which can hinder their access to education, income-generating opportunities, and decision-making processes within their communities. By engaging women as active participants and leaders in water and sanitation initiatives, CRS has sought to address these gender disparities and empower women as agents of change.

In Bangladesh, for instance, CRS has implemented a comprehensive Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) program that goes beyond infrastructure development to tackle social and cultural barriers. By engaging with religious leaders, community elders, and women's groups, the program has fostered dialogue and awareness-raising around the importance of women's participation in WASH decision-making processes. This has led to increased representation of women on WASH committees and the adoption of gender-responsive policies and practices within the communities.

CRS's efforts towards SDG 6 are also deeply intertwined with its commitment to environmental stewardship and the preservation of ecological systems. Through initiatives such as the Blue Harvest program in Central America, CRS has promoted integrated watershed management approaches that protect and restore critical ecosystems, thereby safeguarding water resources and enhancing the resilience of communities to climate change impacts.

Looking ahead, CRS recognizes the need for continued innovation, collaboration, and advocacy to accelerate progress towards SDG 6. Emerging challenges, such as the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance and the impact of rapid urbanization on water and sanitation services, require concerted efforts and cross-sectoral partnerships. CRS remains committed to amplifying the voices of marginalized communities, advocating for equitable access to water and sanitation, and fostering sustainable solutions that respect the intrinsic dignity of all people and the integrity of our shared environment.
