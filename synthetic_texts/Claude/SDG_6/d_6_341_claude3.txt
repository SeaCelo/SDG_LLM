In this analytical report, we delve into the intricate challenges and progress surrounding Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) – Clean Water and Sanitation – within the context of the occupied Palestinian territories. Our analysis draws upon extensive research, field observations, and consultations with local stakeholders, presenting a comprehensive assessment of the water crisis and its broader implications.

The prolonged Israeli occupation has profoundly impacted Palestinian water resources, exacerbating an already precarious situation. The inequitable distribution of shared water resources, coupled with restrictions on Palestinian access and control, has resulted in a severe water deficit. This deficit is particularly acute in the Gaza Strip, where over-extraction of groundwater has led to the intrusion of saline water, rendering a substantial portion of the aquifer unsuitable for human consumption or agricultural purposes.

In the West Bank, the situation is equally dire, with Israeli settlements consuming a disproportionate share of the available water resources. Palestinian communities often face intermittent water supply, forcing them to rely on costly water trucking or unsafe alternative sources. This water scarcity has far-reaching consequences for public health, economic development, and environmental sustainability.

The lack of adequate sanitation infrastructure further compounds the water crisis. In Gaza, the damage to sewage treatment facilities during repeated military offensives has led to the discharge of untreated wastewater into the Mediterranean Sea, posing grave environmental and public health risks. In the West Bank, the inability to build or maintain sewage networks due to Israeli restrictions has resulted in the contamination of groundwater resources and the degradation of fragile ecosystems.

Despite these formidable challenges, Palestinian institutions and civil society organizations have demonstrated remarkable resilience and determination in addressing the water and sanitation crisis. Innovative approaches, such as rainwater harvesting, wastewater treatment and reuse, and water conservation measures, have been implemented to mitigate the impact of water scarcity. However, these efforts are often constrained by limited resources, lack of access to essential materials, and the ever-present restrictions imposed by the Israeli occupation.

It is crucial to acknowledge the inextricable link between the water crisis and the broader political context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The resolution of the water issue hinges on addressing the root causes of the conflict and adhering to international laws and conventions, which guarantee the Palestinian people's right to self-determination and control over their natural resources.

In light of these considerations, we propose a comprehensive strategy to address SDG 6 in the occupied Palestinian territories. This strategy encompasses the following key elements:

1. Equitable distribution of shared water resources: Immediate steps must be taken to ensure the fair and sustainable allocation of shared water resources, in accordance with international law and the principles of human rights.

2. Infrastructure development: Substantial investments are needed to rehabilitate and expand water and sanitation infrastructure, including desalination plants, wastewater treatment facilities, and water distribution networks.

3. Capacity building and technology transfer: Enhancing local capacities through training, knowledge exchange, and the transfer of appropriate technologies is essential for the effective management and conservation of water resources.

4. Advocacy and international cooperation: Concerted efforts are required to raise awareness of the water crisis and mobilize international support, both politically and financially, to address this critical issue.

5. Environmental protection and restoration: Proactive measures must be implemented to safeguard and restore fragile ecosystems, such as groundwater aquifers, wetlands, and coastal areas, which are vital for long-term water security and environmental sustainability.

6. Integrated water resources management: A holistic approach that considers the interconnected nature of water, land, and energy resources is necessary for achieving sustainable water management in the occupied Palestinian territories.

In conclusion, addressing the water and sanitation crisis in the occupied Palestinian territories is not merely a technical or environmental challenge; it is a moral and legal imperative that demands a comprehensive and just resolution. Only through concerted efforts, international cooperation, and a genuine commitment to upholding the rights of the Palestinian people can we achieve the goals of SDG 6 and pave the way for a sustainable and prosperous future for all.
