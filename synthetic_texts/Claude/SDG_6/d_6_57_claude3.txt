Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), written from the perspective of demographer and social commentator Bernard Salt:

Clean Water and Sanitation: The Make-or-Break Goal for Our Thirsty, Urbanizing World  

By Bernard Salt, Demographer and Social Commentator

As a student of population trends, I have long been fascinated by the intricate dances between humanity and our most vital natural resource: water. For eons, civilizations flourished along the banks of great rivers and lakes, their very existence tethered to reliable sources of fresh water for drinking, bathing, agriculture, and industry. The rise and fall of empires was often determined by their ability to harness and conserve this liquid lifeblood.

And now, in the 21st century, a new crisis looms. The world's population continues its giddy ascent, projected to swell from 7.7 billion today to around 9.7 billion by 2050. But this swelling human tide masks a deeper demographic churn - one that will place unprecedented stresses on our water systems. According to UN projections, the world's urban areas will absorb almost all of this population growth over coming decades, ballooning from 4.2 billion residents in 2018 to 6.7 billion by 2050. Nearly 90% of this increase is set to unfold across Asia and Africa.

These dense new urban jungles will be veritable water-guzzling factories, consuming resources at a voracious rate. Exacerbating these pressures, climate change is already disrupting weather patterns and shrinking glacial reservoirs that feed rivers and aquifers across every inhabited continent. Several long-term 'megadroughts' are projected to descend on the Mediterranean region, western North America, southern Africa, and much of South America.

In short, the world's cities are swelling while many of our vital freshwater basins are dwindling. The Sustainable Development Goal of ensuring "availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all" is thus a civilizational imperative of the highest order. Progress here is not some optional luxury - it is Mission Critical if we hope to build the vibrant, healthy cities of tomorrow.

But we face generational dilemmas in managing this resource crisis. In many developing nations across Africa, South Asia, and beyond, solving water scarcity means breaking cycles of poverty, gender inequality and weak governance that have constrained investment in infrastructure and resource management over decades. In the modern megalopolises of China, India, Nigeria and elsewhere, policymakers face the herculean task of upgrading antiquated, intermittent water networks while extending new trunk lines to mushrooming informal settlements.  

At the same time, the developed world's management of water resources remains woefully inefficient. In Australia's thirsty cities, for instance, the average household feasts on some 230 cubic litres of potable water every single day - enough to fill a small backyard swimming pool each week. We flush precious drinking water down our toilets, irrigate gardens with treated supplies, and pipe clean water hundreds of kilometers only to see it leak away through decrepit pipes at alarming rates.

The scale of the challenge is immense, but so too are the potential social and economic dividends of better water stewardship. Universal access to safe drinking water and sanitation could prevent as many as 842,000 diarrheal disease deaths annually. Economic productivity would soar as the crippling time-tax of hauling water over large distances is alleviated, particularly for women and girls in many low-income nations. And better wastewater management would protect fragile aquatic ecosystems, upon which inland communities depend for food, employment and culture.

While the obstacles are many, emerging technologies and ideas offer some tantalizing possibilities. Breakthroughs in desalination, wastewater recycling, remote sensing, and smart metering open new fronts in the ages-old struggle to husband this invaluable resource. Innovative policies like water pricing and economic incentives for conservation and efficiency could reshape consumer behavior. And public-private partnerships to install decentralized treatment systems in remote areas offer hope for leapfrogging traditional models.

If past patterns hold true, the human story of this century will be scripted largely within the world's cities. But the pen that writes that narrative will be fueled by clean water and sanitation. Sustainable Development Goal 6 sits at the fulcrum of our urban future - ignore it at our civilizational peril.
