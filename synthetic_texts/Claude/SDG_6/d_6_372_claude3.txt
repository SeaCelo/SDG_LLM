The International Organization for Migration (IOM) recognizes the pivotal role of Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) – Clean Water and Sanitation – in addressing the multifaceted challenges faced by migrants and displaced populations worldwide. Access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services is a fundamental human right and a critical determinant of human health, dignity, and well-being, particularly for those navigating the complexities of migration.

In the context of forced displacement, conflicts, and natural disasters, the provision of WASH services is often severely compromised, exacerbating the vulnerability of affected populations. Inadequate access to safe water sources and sanitation facilities not only poses grave risks to public health but also perpetuates the cycle of poverty and marginalization. Migrant and refugee settlements, urban slums, and temporary shelters are frequently characterized by overcrowding, poor infrastructure, and a lack of basic services, creating breeding grounds for water-borne diseases and heightening the risk of outbreaks.

IOM recognizes the inextricable link between water security and human mobility, as water scarcity and environmental degradation are increasingly driving factors behind forced migration and displacement. Climate change-induced phenomena, such as droughts, desertification, and sea-level rise, are exacerbating water stress in many regions, undermining livelihoods and triggering mass population movements. Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive and collaborative approach that integrates water resource management, disaster risk reduction, and sustainable development efforts.

IOM's interventions in the realm of WASH are multifaceted, ranging from emergency response and humanitarian assistance to long-term capacity building and infrastructure development. In acute crisis situations, IOM prioritizes the rapid deployment of emergency WASH services, such as water trucking, the installation of temporary sanitation facilities, and the distribution of hygiene kits. These interventions are critical in preventing the spread of diseases and ensuring the dignity and well-being of affected populations.

However, IOM recognizes the importance of transitioning from emergency response to sustainable solutions that promote resilience and self-reliance among migrant and displaced communities. In protracted displacement contexts, IOM works closely with host governments, local authorities, and community-based organizations to develop and rehabilitate water and sanitation infrastructure. This includes the construction and maintenance of boreholes, water treatment plants, and sanitation facilities, as well as the promotion of safe hygiene practices through community outreach and behavior change campaigns.

IOM's interventions are guided by a rights-based approach, ensuring that WASH services are accessible, affordable, and culturally appropriate for all, including marginalized groups such as women, children, and persons with disabilities. Particular attention is paid to addressing the specific needs and vulnerabilities of these groups, such as the provision of gender-sensitive sanitation facilities and the promotion of menstrual hygiene management.

Moreover, IOM recognizes the importance of integrating WASH interventions with other sectors, such as health, education, and livelihoods, to achieve a holistic and sustainable impact. For instance, IOM supports the establishment of WASH facilities in schools and health centers, promoting safe environments for learning and healthcare delivery. Additionally, IOM explores innovative approaches to water resource management, such as rainwater harvesting, wastewater treatment, and the promotion of water-efficient agricultural practices, contributing to the resilience and self-sufficiency of migrant and displaced communities.

Partnerships and collaboration are central to IOM's approach to SDG 6. IOM works closely with various stakeholders, including UN agencies, non-governmental organizations, national governments, and local communities, to ensure a coordinated and effective response. This collaborative approach fosters knowledge-sharing, resource mobilization, and the development of contextually relevant solutions.

In conclusion, IOM's commitment to SDG 6 is grounded in the recognition that access to clean water and sanitation is a fundamental human right and a prerequisite for human dignity, health, and well-being. Through its comprehensive interventions, spanning emergency response, infrastructure development, capacity building, and policy advocacy, IOM strives to ensure that migrant and displaced populations have access to safe and sustainable WASH services, contributing to their resilience, self-reliance, and overall well-being.
