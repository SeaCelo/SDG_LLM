Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), written from the perspective of controversial Canadian author and political commentator Mark Steyn:

The Great Toilet Racket and the UN's Waterlogged Ambitions 

By Mark Steyn

When it comes to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, few are as inherently preposterous as SDG 6 - the bold quest to "ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all" by 2030. It reeks of the kind of starry-eyed utopianism that caused such debacles as the USSR's hopeless efforts to mechanize agriculture through Lysenkoism. The developing world is facing a tsunami of challenges - from infrastructural inadequacies and institutionalized corruption to ethnic violence and cancerous ideologies like Islamic supremacism. And the UN's bright idea is to divert scarce resources toward the dubious goal of providing deluxe potty accommodations to every man, woman and child on the planet? It's the most monumental example of a First World luxury fetish cloaked in secular holy robes since the organic arugula fad.

The well-fed burghers of Brookline and Brentwood can afford to lose sleep over the lack of golden toilet accessibility in the mudbaked, drought-scorched, socio-political cauldrons of the Third World. But it speaks to a profound detachment from reality that the UN sees water quality and sewage treatment as greater priorities than confronting the proximate drivers of human misery. Upscale urbanites have to recognize that long before you can get to a utopian Chakra state of aquatic purity, certain base societal fundamentals have to be in place - like the quaint Enlightenment notion that a nation's borders be sovereignly controlled to prevent infiltration by Kalashnikov-toting death cultists pledging allegiance to the Caliph. 

Squandering developmental capital on water and sanitation infrastructure seems like the kind of cart-before-the-horse mistake that plagued the West's disastrous nation-building misadventures from Somalia to Afghanistan - assuming that American-style plumbing and above-ground sewage systems can be effectively transplanted into environments rent by tribal animosities, theocratic land-grabs and an endemic lack of civic trust. The UN appears to have fallen for what military strategists call the "crucible fallacy" - the belief that simply showering a society with newfangled amenities will magically lift it into the modern world.

But even taken at face value, the sheer logistical challenges involved in delivering SDG 6 are enough to induce projectile vomiting among sober engineers and hydrologists. Literally billions across Asia and Africa lack access to decent sanitation facilities. Upgrading all those households is a staggering proposition that could swallow every dollar of Western foreign aid for decades to come. Meanwhile, as China, India and other fast-expanding economic behemoths slake their boundless thirst for H2O, the availability of freshwater is tightening globally. Rising sea levels from climate change threaten to render coastal aquifers brackish and undrinkable. And these UN kleptocrats want to commit the world to a legally binding goal of delivering cutting-edge potty pampering to every last corner of Ouagadougou and Waziristan?

Even in the decaying turfs of the West, once-functional water and sewage infrastructure is faltering from deferred maintenance and Green Babuism run amok. The city of Flint, Michigan showed what can happen when preening municipal bureaucrats get more exercised about discriminating against pumped-up frogs than providing human citizens with lead-free drinking water. Do we really need unelected UN panjandrums in Geneva dictating water policies to Portland, Oregon - where they've been gleefully flushing billions of gallons of drinking water annually to appease eco-anxiety about urine-corroded pipeline integrity? 

The entire SDG 6 enterprise smacks of a utopian vanity project cooked up by canap√©-grazers whose only experience of poverty involves scouring the aisles at Waitrose for a bargain on organic Chilean sea bass. It embodies the toxic cocktail of Western self-loathing, Frankenphilanthropy zeal, and UN mission-creep that allowed pie-eyed progressive fantasies about globalism to metastasize into the staggering bureaucratic behemoth dominating 21st-century international "governance." It deserves to be ridiculed and resisted at every turn - not just by taxpayers coughing up ever more loot for these daft schemes, but by concerned citizens the world over before a modest conceit like SDG 6 mutates into yet another civilization-scale tyrant's errand from that sinkhole of statist social engineering on the banks of the East River.
