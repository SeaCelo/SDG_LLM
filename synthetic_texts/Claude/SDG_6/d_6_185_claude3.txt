Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) as if written by the political cartoonist and commentator Ted Rall:

Access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation is one of the most fundamental human rights, yet billions still lack these basic necessities in the 21st century. The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 6 aims to rectify this moral and public health crisis by ensuring universal access to clean water and sanitation by 2030. But let's be honest here - given the snail's pace of progress so far, and the reprehensible indifference of many world leaders, do we really expect this goal to be met?

The statistics are appalling. Over 2 billion people worldwide lack access to safely managed drinking water services. A staggering 673 million practice open defecation due to lack of basic sanitation. Every day, thousands of children die from preventable waterborne diseases like cholera and dysentery. Yet the richest among us sip Evian and Fiji Water as a lifestyle accessory.

This unequal access to water and sanitation is not just a devastating humanitarian crisis, but a drag on economic development and security for many nations. In Sub-Saharan Africa, women and girls spend an estimated 40 billion hours each year hauling water, time that could be spent on education and economic opportunities. Lack of proper sanitation also exacerbates the spread of infectious diseases, overburdening fragile healthcare systems.

While wealthy nations pay lip service to increasing aid and investment for water infrastructure, the reality is that most are unwilling to dedicate the trillions required to meet SDG 6. The profit motives of multinational corporations, combined with government inertia, ensure the mass privatization of freshwater sources continues unabated. From Nestl√©'s deplorable tactics to drain impoverished communities to Bechtel's sordid history with privatized water systems, it's clear these entities value profit over the human right to water.  

And the outlook is even bleaker when we consider climate change, which is triggering droughts, floods, rising sea levels and other water-related calamities that disproportionately impact the world's poor. Rising temperatures will make many parts of the globe uninhabitable wastelands where no human can reasonably access clean water. Millions will be displaced, sparking conflict and placing even greater strain on dwindling freshwater resources.

To have any hope of meeting SDG 6, radical action is needed now - public utility models must replace the current paradigm of water as a commodity. Reparations from wealthy nations to the developing world are required to make up for centuries of resource exploitation and environmental degradation. Policies that protect the human right to water over corporate profits must be codified into international law.

But given the current geopolitical realities, none of that is likely to happen. The haves will continue guzzling Perrier, while the have-nots fight over the last drops of potable water amid spreading deserts and overwhelmed slums. Unless the root causes of poverty, inequality and corporate plundering are addressed, SDG 6 will remain an empty rhetorical gesture. The privileged will enjoy their swimming pools and golf course greens while the wretched masses suffer from thirst mere miles away. It's the ultimate symbol of capitalism's cruelty and human civilization's grotesque injustices.
