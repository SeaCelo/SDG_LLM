As the leading development cooperation agency in Thailand, we at the Thailand International Cooperation Agency (TICA) are committed to driving progress towards the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with a particular focus on SDG 6: Ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.

Water is a fundamental resource that underpins all aspects of human development, from public health and food security to economic growth and environmental sustainability. However, according to the United Nations, over 2 billion people worldwide lack access to safely managed drinking water services, and more than 3.6 billion lack safely managed sanitation facilities. This crisis disproportionately affects the most vulnerable populations, exacerbating inequalities and perpetuating cycles of poverty.

In Thailand, we have made significant strides in improving access to water and sanitation services, particularly in urban areas. However, challenges persist in rural and remote regions, where infrastructure deficits and water scarcity pose significant obstacles. Climate change is also exacerbating water stress, with more frequent and intense droughts and floods threatening water security and agricultural productivity.

TICA recognizes that achieving SDG 6 requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the complex interplay of social, economic, and environmental factors. Our strategy is grounded in a holistic understanding of the water-energy-food nexus, acknowledging the interdependencies between these critical sectors and the need for integrated solutions.

At the core of our efforts is a commitment to strengthening water governance and institutional frameworks. We work closely with national and local authorities to develop robust water policies, promote inter-agency coordination, and foster community engagement in water resource management. This includes supporting the development of participatory decision-making processes, ensuring that marginalized groups, such as women and indigenous communities, have a voice in shaping water policies that affect their lives.

Recognizing the critical role of data and information in driving evidence-based decision-making, TICA invests in enhancing water monitoring and reporting systems. We leverage cutting-edge technologies, such as remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS), to map water resources, monitor water quality, and track progress towards SDG 6 targets. This data is then used to inform targeted interventions and adaptive management strategies.

In rural and peri-urban areas, we prioritize the development of sustainable water and sanitation infrastructure, with a focus on decentralized and climate-resilient solutions. This includes promoting rainwater harvesting, constructing community-based water treatment facilities, and implementing low-cost, environmentally friendly sanitation systems. We work closely with local communities to ensure that these interventions are culturally appropriate, socially accepted, and technically sustainable over the long term.

To address water scarcity and mitigate the impacts of climate change, TICA supports the implementation of integrated water resource management (IWRM) practices. This involves promoting efficient water use in agriculture through techniques such as drip irrigation and mulching, as well as encouraging the adoption of water-efficient technologies across various sectors. We also work with communities to restore and conserve critical ecosystems, such as wetlands and forests, which play a vital role in regulating water cycles and mitigating the effects of extreme weather events.

Recognizing the inextricable link between water and human health, we prioritize initiatives that improve access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation facilities, particularly in underserved communities. This includes supporting the construction and rehabilitation of water supply systems, promoting household water treatment and safe storage practices, and raising awareness about the importance of hygiene and sanitation.

To ensure the sustainability of our interventions, TICA emphasizes capacity building and knowledge transfer. We collaborate with academic institutions, civil society organizations, and private sector partners to deliver training programs and facilitate the exchange of best practices. This includes developing curricula and educational materials tailored to local contexts, as well as fostering cross-border knowledge sharing and regional cooperation.

In conclusion, TICA's approach to SDG 6 is grounded in a comprehensive understanding of the complex challenges and opportunities associated with water and sanitation. Through a combination of policy support, infrastructure development, ecosystem conservation, capacity building, and strategic partnerships, we strive to accelerate progress towards achieving universal access to safe and affordable water and sanitation services, while promoting sustainable water resource management and climate resilience. Our efforts are guided by the principles of equity, inclusiveness, and environmental stewardship, ensuring that no one is left behind in our pursuit of a water-secure future for all.
