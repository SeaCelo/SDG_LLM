The African Development Bank's commitment to Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) – ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all – is rooted in the understanding that water is a fundamental resource for life, health, and economic development across the African continent. With over 300 million Africans lacking access to safe drinking water and nearly 700 million without basic sanitation services, addressing this critical issue is an imperative for socio-economic progress and environmental sustainability.

Recognizing the multifaceted nature of this challenge, the Bank's approach is multidimensional, encompassing infrastructure development, policy reforms, capacity building, and regional cooperation. Through its lending and non-lending operations, the Bank is catalyzing investments in water supply and sanitation infrastructure, with a focus on expanding access to underserved rural and urban communities. This includes support for the construction and rehabilitation of water treatment plants, distribution networks, and sewerage systems, as well as the promotion of decentralized solutions such as boreholes, rainwater harvesting, and community-led total sanitation initiatives.

Complementing these efforts, the Bank is supporting the development of robust water governance frameworks and institutional capacities at national and regional levels. This involves technical assistance for policy formulation, regulatory reforms, and strengthening of water utilities' operational and financial management. Particular emphasis is placed on promoting integrated water resources management (IWRM) principles, which recognize the interconnectedness of water resources, land use, and ecosystem health.

Furthermore, the Bank is fostering regional cooperation and knowledge sharing through platforms such as the African Water Facility and the African Water Information System. These initiatives facilitate dialogue, capacity building, and the dissemination of best practices among member countries, enabling them to collectively address transboundary water challenges and harness the potential of shared water resources.

In addressing SDG 6, the Bank is also cognizant of the intricate linkages between water and other development priorities, such as food security, energy, health, and climate change adaptation. For instance, investments in water storage and irrigation infrastructure are vital for enhancing agricultural productivity and resilience to drought, while hydropower development contributes to addressing the continent's energy deficit. Additionally, the Bank is promoting the adoption of water-smart solutions in urban planning and industrial development, minimizing water pollution and encouraging water reuse and recycling.

Recognizing the disproportionate impact of water scarcity and poor sanitation on women and girls, the Bank is actively promoting gender mainstreaming in its water and sanitation interventions. This includes supporting women's participation in decision-making processes, enhancing their access to water resources and sanitation facilities, and promoting their involvement in the management and operation of water services.

To ensure the sustainability of its interventions, the Bank is fostering partnerships with various stakeholders, including civil society organizations, private sector entities, and development partners. These collaborations leverage complementary expertise, resources, and innovative financing mechanisms to enhance the scale and impact of water and sanitation initiatives.

As the African continent continues to grapple with rapid urbanization, population growth, and the escalating effects of climate change, the Bank's efforts toward SDG 6 will remain pivotal in ensuring water security, public health, and resilient communities. Through its comprehensive approach, the Bank is not only addressing the immediate water and sanitation needs but also laying the foundation for long-term sustainable development and socio-economic transformation across Africa.
