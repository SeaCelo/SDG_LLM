The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) recognizes the pivotal role of Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) in ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. As a member of the World Bank Group, MIGA is committed to catalyzing private sector investment and providing political risk insurance to support projects that contribute to sustainable development, including those aligned with SDG 6.

In assessing the global landscape, it is evident that access to clean water and sanitation remains a pressing challenge, particularly in developing countries. According to the United Nations, over 2 billion people lack access to safely managed drinking water services, and 3.6 billion lack access to safely managed sanitation facilities. These deficiencies have far-reaching consequences, impacting public health, economic productivity, and environmental sustainability.

One of the critical factors impeding progress towards SDG 6 is the lack of adequate financing. Investment in water and sanitation infrastructure, as well as the maintenance and operation of existing systems, requires substantial capital resources. However, many countries struggle to allocate sufficient funds due to competing development priorities, limited fiscal capacity, and inefficient resource allocation.

MIGA recognizes the potential of private sector involvement in addressing these challenges. By providing political risk insurance and credit enhancement products, MIGA can facilitate private investment in water and sanitation projects, thereby unlocking additional financing sources and leveraging private sector expertise and innovation.

For instance, MIGA has supported several water supply and sanitation projects in regions facing acute water scarcity, such as the Middle East and North Africa. These projects have involved the construction of desalination plants, wastewater treatment facilities, and distribution networks, leveraging cutting-edge technologies and sustainable practices to ensure efficient water use and environmental protection.

Furthermore, MIGA has encouraged public-private partnerships (PPPs) in the water and sanitation sector, enabling governments to leverage private sector resources and expertise while retaining overall regulatory oversight. These partnerships have proven effective in bringing together diverse stakeholders, aligning incentives, and promoting sustainable water management practices.

In addition to financing, MIGA recognizes the importance of capacity building and knowledge transfer in achieving SDG 6. Through its technical assistance programs, MIGA supports the development of robust legal and regulatory frameworks, promotes best practices in water resource management, and facilitates the transfer of skills and technologies to local communities.

Recognizing the interconnected nature of the SDGs, MIGA also considers the broader socioeconomic and environmental implications of its water and sanitation projects. By promoting inclusive and equitable access to water and sanitation services, MIGA contributes to poverty alleviation, gender equality, and improved health outcomes. Moreover, by prioritizing sustainable practices and resource efficiency, MIGA's projects aim to mitigate environmental degradation, protect ecosystems, and promote climate resilience.

Moving forward, MIGA remains committed to leveraging its expertise and resources to support the achievement of SDG 6. Through continued collaboration with governments, private sector partners, and civil society organizations, MIGA aims to drive transformative investments that ensure access to safe and affordable water and sanitation for all, while promoting sustainable practices and contributing to broader development objectives.
