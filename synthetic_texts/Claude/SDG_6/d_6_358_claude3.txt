The Black Sea Trade and Development Bank presents this analytical report on the progress and challenges surrounding Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6), which aims to "ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all." As a multilateral development bank operating in the Black Sea region, we recognize the pivotal role of water resources in fostering economic growth, environmental sustainability, and societal well-being.

The Black Sea region, encompassing countries such as Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Georgia, Greece, Moldova, Romania, Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine, faces a myriad of water-related challenges. Inadequate access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation services remains a persistent issue in several countries, exacerbated by aging infrastructure, population growth, and urbanization. The region's vulnerability to climate change, manifested through droughts, floods, and water scarcity, further compounds these challenges.

Progress towards SDG 6 in the Black Sea region has been uneven, with some countries making significant strides while others lag behind. Turkey, for instance, has made remarkable progress in expanding access to improved water sources and sanitation facilities, particularly in urban areas. However, rural communities in Turkey, as well as in countries like Armenia and Moldova, continue to grapple with limited access to safe water and inadequate sanitation infrastructure.

Water scarcity poses a significant threat to the region's economic development and environmental sustainability. The Black Sea basin, which includes major rivers such as the Danube, Dniester, and Don, is facing increasing pressure from agriculture, industry, and urbanization. Inefficient water management practices, coupled with aging and leaky water distribution systems, contribute to high levels of water loss and wastage.

The issue of water quality is another pressing concern in the Black Sea region. Industrial and agricultural runoff, inadequate wastewater treatment, and maritime pollution pose severe risks to freshwater ecosystems and coastal areas. The Black Sea itself has been subject to eutrophication, leading to the depletion of oxygen levels and the formation of vast "dead zones" devoid of marine life.

Transboundary water management presents a significant challenge, as many of the region's major rivers and aquifers are shared among multiple countries. Effective cooperation and coordinated management strategies are crucial to address issues such as water allocation, pollution control, and environmental protection. Initiatives like the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River (ICPDR) and the Convention on the Protection of the Black Sea Against Pollution have played a vital role in fostering regional cooperation, but more concerted efforts are needed.

Addressing the water-related challenges in the Black Sea region requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses policy reforms, infrastructure investments, and capacity-building initiatives. The Black Sea Trade and Development Bank has been actively supporting member countries in their efforts to achieve SDG 6 through various financing mechanisms and technical assistance programs.

One notable example is the Bank's support for the modernization of water supply and sanitation systems in Georgia. Through a combination of loans and grants, the Bank has contributed to the rehabilitation and expansion of water treatment plants, distribution networks, and wastewater treatment facilities. These investments have not only improved access to safe water and sanitation services but have also enhanced energy efficiency and environmental sustainability.

Furthermore, the Bank has partnered with international organizations and civil society groups to promote integrated water resources management (IWRM) practices in the region. IWRM principles emphasize a holistic approach to water management, considering the interconnections between water, land, and related resources, while involving stakeholders at all levels of decision-making.

Capacity-building initiatives have also been a focal point for the Bank, recognizing the need for skilled professionals and robust institutional frameworks to effectively manage water resources. Through training programs, knowledge-sharing platforms, and technical assistance projects, the Bank has supported the development of human capital and strengthened the capacities of water utilities, regulatory bodies, and local authorities.

Looking ahead, the Black Sea Trade and Development Bank remains committed to supporting the achievement of SDG 6 in the region. Innovative financing mechanisms, such as blended finance and public-private partnerships, will be explored to mobilize additional resources and leverage private sector participation in water-related projects.

Moreover, the Bank recognizes the importance of integrating water management strategies with broader sustainable development goals, such as climate action (SDG 13), sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11), and responsible consumption and production (SDG 12). A holistic approach that considers the interlinkages between water, energy, food, and environmental systems is crucial for achieving long-term sustainability in the Black Sea region.

In conclusion, the challenges surrounding SDG 6 in the Black Sea region are multifaceted and complex, requiring coordinated efforts from governments, international organizations, the private sector, and civil society. The Black Sea Trade and Development Bank remains steadfast in its commitment to supporting member countries in their pursuit of sustainable water management practices, fostering regional cooperation, and promoting innovative solutions to address the region's water-related challenges.
