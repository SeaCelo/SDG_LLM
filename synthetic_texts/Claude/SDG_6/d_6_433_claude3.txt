Mercy Corps, a global humanitarian organization operating in over 40 countries, has been at the forefront of addressing the critical challenges posed by SDG 6 â€“ ensuring access to water and sanitation for all. Our multi-faceted approach encompasses a range of initiatives tailored to the unique socio-economic and environmental contexts of the communities we serve.

In the arid regions of the Sahel, where water scarcity is a pervasive issue, we have implemented innovative rainwater harvesting techniques. These include the construction of underground cisterns and the promotion of micro-catchment systems, which have proven effective in capturing and storing precious rainwater for domestic and agricultural use. Complementing these efforts, we have collaborated with local communities to establish water user associations, ensuring equitable distribution and sustainable management of these vital resources.

In densely populated urban areas, where access to safe drinking water and sanitation remains a critical challenge, our intervention strategies have focused on rehabilitating and expanding water infrastructure. This includes the construction of community-based water treatment facilities, leveraging innovative technologies such as solar-powered desalination and low-cost filtration systems. Simultaneously, we have undertaken comprehensive hygiene promotion campaigns, emphasizing the importance of handwashing, safe water storage, and proper waste disposal practices.

Our work in disaster-prone regions has prioritized the integration of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions into emergency response efforts. Rapid deployment of mobile water treatment units, distribution of household water filters, and the construction of temporary latrines have been instrumental in preventing the spread of waterborne diseases and mitigating the impacts of displacement on vulnerable populations.

Recognizing the inextricable link between water resources and sustainable livelihoods, we have implemented holistic approaches that integrate WASH initiatives with agricultural development programs. For instance, in drought-affected regions of East Africa, we have introduced drip irrigation systems and promoted water-efficient farming techniques, enabling smallholder farmers to optimize water usage while increasing crop yields and income generation.

Our efforts have also addressed the intersectionality of gender and water security, as women and girls often bear the disproportionate burden of fetching water from distant sources. Through the installation of community water points and the promotion of female leadership in water management committees, we have empowered women to play a pivotal role in decision-making processes, while reducing the time and physical strain associated with water collection.

Underpinning our work is a commitment to fostering partnerships and leveraging local expertise. We collaborate closely with government agencies, civil society organizations, and academic institutions to ensure our interventions are aligned with national and regional WASH strategies and informed by the latest research and best practices. Additionally, we prioritize capacity-building initiatives, equipping local communities with the knowledge and skills necessary to sustain and replicate successful WASH interventions.

As we look towards the future, our efforts will continue to evolve in response to emerging challenges, such as rapid urbanization, climate change, and the increasing frequency of natural disasters. We remain steadfast in our commitment to achieving SDG 6, recognizing that access to safe water and sanitation is not only a fundamental human right but also a critical determinant of health, food security, and socio-economic development.
