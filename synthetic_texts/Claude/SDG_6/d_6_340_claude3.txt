Pakistan's journey toward achieving Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6), which aims to "ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all," has been marked by significant challenges and modest progress. As a country grappling with water scarcity, rapid urbanization, and climate change impacts, Pakistan's efforts to address water and sanitation issues are crucial for its socio-economic development and environmental sustainability.

The country's water resources are under immense stress due to a combination of factors, including inefficient water management practices, aging infrastructure, and the adverse effects of climate change. Pakistan's reliance on surface water from the Indus River Basin, which accounts for nearly 75% of its water supply, has been strained by reduced glacial melt and erratic precipitation patterns. Groundwater resources, once considered a reliable alternative, are now being depleted at an alarming rate, with aquifers experiencing rapid depletion in various regions.

Furthermore, Pakistan's water distribution system is plagued by inefficiencies, with significant water losses occurring due to leakages, evaporation, and outdated irrigation techniques. The agricultural sector, which accounts for over 90% of the country's freshwater consumption, has been slow to adopt modern water-saving technologies and practices, exacerbating the strain on limited water resources.

Inadequate access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities remains a persistent challenge, particularly in rural areas and urban slums. According to the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources (PCRWR), approximately 44% of the rural population lacks access to safe drinking water, while 36% of the urban population lacks access to improved sanitation facilities. This lack of access has severe implications for public health, with waterborne diseases such as diarrhea, cholera, and hepatitis being leading causes of morbidity and mortality, particularly among children.

To address these challenges, Pakistan has undertaken several initiatives and programs in collaboration with international organizations and development partners. The National Water Policy, introduced in 2018, aims to establish a comprehensive framework for water resource management, conservation, and equitable distribution. However, effective implementation has been hindered by limited financial resources, institutional capacity constraints, and weak enforcement mechanisms.

The Pakistan Sustainable Development Goals Support Programme, funded by the European Union, has been instrumental in promoting integrated water resource management and improving access to water and sanitation services in various districts. This program has facilitated the construction of water supply schemes, installation of solar-powered water filtration plants, and the establishment of community-based organizations to ensure sustainable operation and maintenance of these facilities.

Additionally, the Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund (PPAF), in collaboration with international partners, has undertaken several initiatives to improve water and sanitation conditions in rural areas. These initiatives include the construction of low-cost household latrines, installation of hand pumps and water filtration systems, and the promotion of hygiene education campaigns. However, the scale and impact of these initiatives remain limited due to resource constraints and the vast geographical expanse of the country.

Addressing Pakistan's water and sanitation challenges requires a multi-faceted approach that involves strengthening institutional capacities, fostering public-private partnerships, promoting water conservation practices, and investing in sustainable and climate-resilient infrastructure. Effective implementation of the National Water Policy and coordination among various stakeholders, including government agencies, civil society organizations, and local communities, are crucial for achieving SDG 6 targets.

Furthermore, improving water governance through transparent and participatory decision-making processes, addressing gender disparities in access to water and sanitation services, and promoting research and innovation in water-efficient technologies are imperative for ensuring long-term water security and sustainable development in Pakistan.
