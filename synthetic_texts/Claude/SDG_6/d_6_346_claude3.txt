The Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID) presents the following comprehensive analysis on the current status of Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6): Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.

Universal access to drinking water and sanitation remains a pressing challenge in many regions of the world. Despite progress, significant gaps persist that threaten to undermine efforts to eradicate poverty, protect the environment, and promote gender equality. In this context, SDG 6 assumes critical importance as a catalyst for sustainable development.

In the area of drinking water, while the proportion of the global population with access to safely managed water supply services has increased, enormous disparities still exist between urban and rural areas, as well as between different regions and countries. Vulnerable communities, such as indigenous populations and remote areas, continue to face considerable barriers to accessing this vital resource. Furthermore, water source contamination, water scarcity, and the effects of climate change threaten to reverse progress achieved.

Regarding sanitation, the situation is even more concerning. Recent estimates indicate that more than half of the global population lacks access to safely managed sanitation services. This deficiency has devastating implications for public health, environmental degradation, and economic productivity loss. Women and girls are particularly affected, as the lack of adequate facilities for menstrual hygiene perpetuates cycles of inequality and exclusion.

Another key aspect of SDG 6 is the integrated management of water resources, which involves coordinating various sectors and stakeholders to ensure efficient and sustainable use of water. However, fragmented policies and sectoral approaches continue to hinder efforts to address water-related challenges holistically. Additionally, poor governance, lack of investment, and limited institutional capacity undermine the effective implementation of integrated management strategies.

In this regard, it is essential to strengthen international cooperation and partnerships to mobilize financial and technical resources, promote knowledge transfer, and encourage the participation of all stakeholders. AECID, in collaboration with other development actors, plays a crucial role in facilitating these partnerships and supporting partner countries in their efforts to achieve SDG 6.

Moreover, it is essential to address the underlying causes of water scarcity and lack of sanitation, such as poverty, inequality, and unsustainable production and consumption patterns. This requires transformative approaches that promote climate resilience, water-use efficiency, and the protection of aquatic ecosystems.

In summary, achieving SDG 6 demands renewed commitment and concerted action by all actors involved. Only through an integrated approach and collective effort can we guarantee universal access to drinking water and sanitation, safeguarding this vital resource for present and future generations.
