The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) recognizes the pivotal role of SDG 6, "Clean Water and Sanitation," in safeguarding the well-being and development of children worldwide. Access to safe and affordable drinking water, adequate sanitation, and hygiene facilities is a fundamental human right and a prerequisite for ensuring the survival, health, and dignity of every child.

Despite the progress made over the past decades, millions of children continue to face the detrimental consequences of inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services. This report delves into the global landscape of WASH, highlighting the challenges, best practices, and innovative solutions that UNICEF and its partners are implementing to address this pressing issue.

The lack of access to WASH services disproportionately affects children, particularly those living in marginalized communities, remote areas, or conflict zones. Diarrheal diseases, caused by unsafe water, poor sanitation, and inadequate hygiene, remain a leading cause of child mortality, accounting for hundreds of thousands of preventable deaths each year. Furthermore, the absence of WASH facilities in schools and health care centers undermines children's ability to learn, grow, and thrive, perpetuating cycles of poverty and inequality.

UNICEF's approach to addressing the WASH crisis is multifaceted, emphasizing the integration of sustainable solutions, community empowerment, and capacity building. In partnership with governments, civil society organizations, and the private sector, UNICEF is implementing innovative strategies to increase access to safe water sources, such as drilling boreholes, constructing water treatment plants, and promoting rainwater harvesting techniques.

Recognizing the critical importance of adequate sanitation, UNICEF is actively involved in the construction and rehabilitation of latrines, promoting the adoption of improved sanitation facilities, and advocating for the elimination of open defecation practices. Community-led total sanitation (CLTS) initiatives have proven effective in raising awareness, fostering behavior change, and empowering communities to take ownership of their sanitation solutions.

Hygiene promotion and education are integral components of UNICEF's WASH interventions, as they ensure the sustainable adoption of healthy practices and maximize the impact of water and sanitation interventions. UNICEF's efforts include conducting hygiene awareness campaigns, distributing hygiene kits, and integrating WASH education into school curricula.

In emergency and humanitarian contexts, UNICEF plays a pivotal role in providing immediate WASH assistance to affected populations, ensuring access to safe water, sanitation facilities, and hygiene supplies. These interventions not only address immediate needs but also lay the foundation for long-term recovery and resilience building.

Furthermore, UNICEF recognizes the interlinkages between WASH and other SDGs, such as health, education, gender equality, and climate action. Improved WASH services contribute to better health outcomes, increased school attendance, particularly for girls, and enhanced resilience to the impacts of climate change.

To accelerate progress towards SDG 6, UNICEF advocates for increased investment in WASH infrastructure, strengthening of national policies and regulatory frameworks, and the integration of WASH interventions into broader development strategies. Collaborating with governments, civil society, and the private sector, UNICEF leverages its expertise and global reach to drive innovation, foster partnerships, and mobilize resources for sustainable WASH solutions.

Through its comprehensive approach, UNICEF is catalyzing transformative change, ensuring that every child has access to safe water, adequate sanitation, and proper hygiene facilities â€“ a fundamental prerequisite for their survival, health, and overall well-being.
