Water scarcity and inadequate access to safe water and sanitation remain critical challenges, particularly in developing regions, posing significant obstacles to sustainable development and human well-being. As a faith-based organization committed to alleviating poverty and promoting sustainable livelihoods, Mennonite Central Committee (MCC) recognizes the pivotal role of Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) in addressing these pressing issues.

Through our extensive field operations and partnerships with local communities, we have witnessed the devastating impacts of water insecurity firsthand. Lack of access to clean water and sanitation perpetuates a vicious cycle of poverty, poor health, and compromised education and economic opportunities, disproportionately affecting women and children. In many regions where MCC operates, climate change exacerbates water stress, leading to prolonged droughts, depleted groundwater reserves, and increased competition for scarce resources, often fueling conflicts.

MCC's approach to SDG 6 is grounded in a holistic understanding of water as a fundamental human right and a shared resource that transcends political boundaries. Our interventions are guided by the principles of integrated water resources management (IWRM), which recognizes the interconnectedness of water systems, ecosystems, and human activities. By fostering community-led initiatives and collaborating with local stakeholders, we strive to develop context-specific solutions that address the multifaceted challenges of water scarcity, pollution, and inequitable access.

One of our flagship programs in this domain is the implementation of community-based water harvesting and conservation techniques in semi-arid regions of sub-Saharan Africa. By leveraging traditional knowledge and modern technologies, we have successfully introduced sustainable practices such as contour bunding, water-spreading weirs, and sand dams, which capture and store precious rainwater for agriculture and domestic use. These interventions not only enhance water security but also promote climate resilience and food sovereignty, aligning with the interconnected nature of the SDGs.

In urban slums and informal settlements, where infrastructure deficits exacerbate water and sanitation challenges, MCC has pioneered innovative solutions such as decentralized wastewater treatment systems and community-managed sanitation facilities. These interventions not only improve public health and hygiene but also create employment opportunities and foster a sense of ownership among residents, paving the way for long-term sustainability.

Recognizing the inextricable link between water, gender, and empowerment, MCC places a strong emphasis on involving women in decision-making processes and capacity-building initiatives. Our Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) programs prioritize the participation of women and girls, who often bear the disproportionate burden of water collection and management. By enhancing their agency and leadership roles, we aim to challenge traditional gender norms and promote equitable access to water resources.

Furthermore, MCC's water initiatives are closely aligned with our peacebuilding efforts, as water scarcity can be a significant driver of conflict. Through transboundary water cooperation projects, we facilitate dialogue and collaborative management of shared water resources among communities and nations, fostering trust, reconciliation, and sustainable resource governance.

As we look toward the 2030 agenda, MCC remains committed to accelerating progress on SDG 6 and its interlinked goals. We recognize the need for innovative financing mechanisms, cross-sectoral partnerships, and strengthened institutional capacities to achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable water and sanitation. By leveraging our faith-based networks, grassroots connections, and technical expertise, we will continue to advocate for water justice, promote sustainable water management practices, and empower communities to become stewards of this precious resource.
