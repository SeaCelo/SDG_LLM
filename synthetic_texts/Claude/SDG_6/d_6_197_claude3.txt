Here is a long academic article about SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), drafted as if written by Gene Weingarten:

The Sixth Maslow Need: When You Gotta Go

As we ascend Maslow's hierarchy of needs, eventually reaching that lofty spire of "self-actualization," it's easy to overlook a primal urge that resides somewhere between physical and safety — the need to heed the call of nature without risking life, dignity or felony charges. I'm talking about taking a whiz.

We in the developed world have been spoiled by a remarkably sophisticated sanitation infrastructure girding our societies. Seldom do we ponder the miracle of indoor plumbing that allows us to evacuate our metabolic waste products with surpassing convenience and gratuitous propriety. A few deft maneuvers, a grateful flush, and jeureuse défécation! Our bodily functions have been reduced to a polite, furtive murmur.

Not so for an estimated 3.6 billion global residents who lack access to safely managed sanitation services. For these brothers and sisters, the diurnal hunt for a discreet loo amounts to an extreme sport, with vacant lots and fetid rivers as perilous venues. It is a game of fecal Russian roulette that frequently proves fatal — diarrheal disease is a leading killer of children. Pandemics may roar out of areas with poor sanitation and hygiene. And we mustn't neglect the trauma and loss of human dignity suffered by women denied safe, private facilities.

The daunting challenge of providing reliable sanitation drove the UN to designate it as its own Sustainable Development Goal. SDG 6 is a mighty hydra, with subgoals ranging from improving water quality to restoring ecosystems to expanding international cooperation. Tackling it requires unpacking knotty political, cultural and socioeconomic obstacles bedeviling the water and sanitation nexus. 

Many low-income nations lack the infrastructure, governance and resources for comprehensive water and sanitation services. Fixing this means overcoming the cocksure arrogance of the wealthy and extending to the poor that most humble of courtesies — a safe, clean place to park a derriere. NGOs like Water.org have made commendable strides, but progress remains glacial.

Even in affluent societies, water infrastructure is often antiquated and sewage systems overtaxed. America's capital has achieved the ignoble distinction of an ongoing fecal fertilizer crisis, with sewage overflows routinely deluging the Anacostia and Potomac rivers. It's an unfolding super-bummer straining D.C.'s limited budget for a system overhaul.

The most intriguing solutions could come from frugal innovation in the developing world. India and parts of Africa have seen grassroots movements promoting simple, low-cost pour-flush toilets and decentralized waste treatment systems. Some Indian towns have achieved widespread sanitation coverage by exploiting behavioral nudges like offering free TV sets (catnip for the aspiring middle class) to households installing toilets. Perhaps they appreciate that nothing enriches one's pursuit of Maslow's Xanadu like removing the angst over where to pinch a loaf.

Behavioral economics aside, providing safe sanitation demands massive investment, institutional agility and cultural reformation. It likely surpasses our capabilities as a species — much like how we may never overcome our innate fondness for staring directly at eclipses. But we must try, because the alternative is a world awash in admonitory slogans like "If it's brown, let the water down." And nobody wants that, Vishnu knows.
