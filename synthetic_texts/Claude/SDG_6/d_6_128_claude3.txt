Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), written from the perspective of British journalist and broadcaster Richard Littlejohn:

The UN's Sustainable Development Goal 6 to "ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all" sounds rather noble on paper. But let's be honest here - it's just another example of global bureaucrats desperately trying to overcomplicate straightforward issues with reams of politically-correct codswallop. 

Access to clean water and basic sanitation is not some opaque, lofty objective requiring targetted "interventions" and overpaid NGO trendies parachuting into far-flung corners of the world. It's quite simple really - first world nations solved this dilemma long ago through tried-and-tested methods of infrastructure development, public health policies, and basic hygiene education. Running water, flushing toilets, soap - that sort of thing. It's not exactly rocket science.

The fact that over 2 billion people globally still lack access to safe drinking water, and nearly half the world's population doesn't have a decent loo, is nothing but an affront to common sense. While we gladly open the foreign aid floodgates and divert taxpayer funds to climate doublespeak and diversibollocks workshops in Ouagadougou, alleviating these basic living standards seems almost too obvious. 

If only the UN's Agenda 2030 was determined through good old-fashioned Blitz spirit instead of being hijacked by right-on social engineers! We'd skip all the bureaucratic dither and see these exotic Shambolics finally sorted with proper drainage, water treatment plants, and the health/hygiene fundamentals we've taken for granted since Victorian times.

Of course, that smacks too much of common sense, good governance and basic human decency for the cultural relativists and self-flagellating Guardianistas championing Goal 6. They'd rather indulge faddish ideological narratives about indigenous water sovereignty, challenging Western hygiene norms, and recognizing the human rights of open defecators.

Instead of fixating on "sustainable access" targets, we should be using that foreign aid money for sensible sanitation infrastructure. Bin the box-ticking and buzzwords - prioritize sturdy plumbing and appropriate sewage management. It will do far more for health outcomes and quality of life than any number of inclusive stakeholder dialogues.

Frankly, I'd back a few Tommies with some shovels and piping over virtue-signalling academics and water consultants from Oxfam anyday. If previous generations could tackle cholera outbreaks through vigorous sanitation schemes, there's no reason we can't get clean water flowing to every corner of the planet today. Other than contemporary prejudices against colonialism, hard graft and good old-fashioned British common sense, that is.
