Access to Dignity: Unpacking the Human Stories Behind SDG 6  

By Carolyn Hax

When we discuss the global water crisis, it's easy to get mired in the staggering statistics - 2.2 billion people lacking access to safely managed drinking water, 4.2 billion without safely managed sanitation. But behind those overwhelming numbers lie intensely personal stories of human struggle, indignity and heartbreak that we must not ignore.  

Take Sara, a young mother of two in rural Kenya. Each morning before dawn, she rises to undertake a grueling 6-mile trek to the nearest water source with her young children in tow. She joins a quiet queue of other women and girls, waiting hours under the searing sun to fill her jerry cans with contaminated water that sickens her family regularly. But she has no choice - it's this or nothing for cooking, drinking, bathing.  

Or Rajesh, living in the teeming slums of Mumbai, whose shredded sense of privacy and self-worth comes from being forced to defecate in the open among millions of others, with no toilets or latrines available. The humiliation is compounded for women like his wife, who must wait until nightfall when they can relieve themselves under shadow, risking sexual assault.   

The anguish threads through every facet of their lives - the grinding cycle of poverty and disease from constant diarrhea, the girlchild's education disrupted by distant water sources and inadequate sanitation facilities, the psychological torment and indignities, large and small.

Yet these wrenching human stories are all too often stripped from the discourse on SDG 6, lost in a barrage of sector jargon, policy prescriptions and econometric modeling. At our own peril do we allow ourselves this distance - for water is elemental to human dignity and human flourishing.   

Ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation must be framed through this defining moral lens. It is not just about health impacts and economic constraints, but a rallying cry for the basic hubris codified in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights - that all people, no matter their circumstance, are entitled to a life of dignity.  

The United Nations' recognition of water and sanitation as a human right in 2010 was a vital milestone in this struggle. But what of the yawning implementation gap a decade on? Top-down interventions have foundered without community engagement, and issues of inequity and discrimination have stymied progress. In many cultures, patriarchal norms systematically deny women and girls their right to water and sanitation access. Elsewhere caste hierarchies, racial segregation and disability status determine who drinks clean water and who drinks contaminated water.

To truly uphold the human rights aspiration of SDG 6, we must fearlessly confront these power imbalances and webs of discrimination on the ground. It means reaching the most underserved - rural populations, slum-dwellers, nomadic communities,  refugees and internally displaced peoples. It means closely consulting women and girls and heeding their voices and participation in solutions. It means reimagining community water supply and sanitation facilities with a gender lens and challenging cultural taboos. 

Above all, it means recognizing that something as elemental as water access is tied to human dignity. For in each personal tale of desperation and undignified circumstance, we glimpse our own frail humanity laid bare without this most basic of birthrights. When we raise the rallying cry of water for all, we must appreciate the moral uncompromising universal call to human dignity at its core.

Only then can we truly honor SDG 6 not just in text, but in the emancipated lives of those like Sara, Rajesh and billions of others worldwide who have for too long been denied their inalienable human rights and human worth. It is the most profound struggle of our era - and one in which we all have a stake in the outcome.
