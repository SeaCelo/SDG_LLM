Here is a detailed newspaper article about Sustainable Development Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), as if written for The New York Times:

A Crisis Invisible: The Global Battle for Clean Water and Sanitation

By The New York Times Editorial Board

While climate change has catalyzed a planetary reckoning over environmental perils, a concurrent crisis unfolds with equal destructiveness - the lack of safe water, sanitation, and hygiene. This issue, enshrined as the sixth Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 6) by the United Nations, is an oft-overlooked humanitarian emergency playing out across the world's most impoverished corners.

Beyond the unfathomable human toll, this shortfall has cascading impacts on education, economic productivity, and ecological equilibrium. Its scale reflects the great disconnect between the haves and have-nots - between those for whom sanitary conditions are a self-evident right and the 2 billion people currently living without safely managed drinking water services.

An estimated 4.2 billion individuals lack access to safely managed sanitation facilities like toilets, according to UNICEF and the World Health Organization. Open defecation, the practice of relieving oneself outdoors due to infrastructure deficiencies, still afflicts nearly 500 million people worldwide. Each year, 297,000 children under the age of five perish from diarrheal diseases linked to poor sanitation, hygiene, and tainted water sources.

"When we think about threats to humanity, our mind readily goes to climate change, pandemics, and wars. But the water and sanitation crisis claims lives every single day," said Kelly Ann Naylor, UNICEF's Global Chief of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene. "It's an invisible emergency unfolding before our eyes."

Progress on SDG 6 has been outpaced by population growth, urbanization, environmental degradation, and extreme weather fueled by climate change. Rising sea levels are contaminating precious freshwater sources through saltwater intrusion. Intensifying droughts and desertification are depleting finite aquifer reserves. Erratic rainfall, roiling rivers, and catastrophic floods are disrupting sanitation infrastructure and dispersing waterborne pathogens. Meanwhile, industrial runoff and improper waste disposal continue poisoning water supplies unabated. 

As the crisis worsens, the burdens disproportionately fall on women and girls in the developing world. Tasked with the labor-intensive chore of collecting water from distant wells or streams, their education and economic opportunities are stymied. Menstrual hygiene management also becomes an overlooked indignity, as millions lack access to clean sanitation facilities and menstrual supplies.

"We cannot achieve a sustainable future if half the population lacks the facilities to properly address their biological needs with privacy and dignity," said Shannon Daley-Harris, advocacy director at FEMNET, a women's rights network. "Sanitation infrastructure is paramount to gender equality."

Attempts to meaningfully address SDG 6 have been chronically underfunded. While the World Bank estimates $114 billion per year is required to attain universal access by 2030, only $28 billion is being allocated currently across official development assistance and household contributions. Humanitarian response plans still routinely neglect water and sanitation needs during armed conflicts and natural disasters.

As the world seeks to "build back better" from COVID-19, unprecedented investment and policy prioritization is needed. The virus exposed WASH (water, sanitation, and hygiene) vulnerabilities with the viral spread of symptomatic messaging: lather with soap for 20 seconds under running water. Such directives represent a baffling disconnect for the billions lacking these basic resources.

From stemming preventable diseases to bolstering food security and economic productivity, clean water and sanitation access yields an outsized return. According to the World Health Organization, every $1 invested in WASH initiatives generates a $4.30 economic return by reducing healthcare costs and unlocking educational and occupational opportunities.

Solutions exist, but require ingenuity and robust financing. Decentralized local water treatment facilities, rainwater harvesting arrays, and pit latrine infrastructure are relatively low-cost interventions that could transform communities. Concerted hygiene education programs, social entrepreneurship models for distributing sanitary products, and waste treatment overhauls can uplift human dignity while safeguarding watersheds.

Without course correction, this crisis will only intensify in the coming decades. Geopolitical tensions over shared transboundary water sources may flare as resources diminish. Environmental shocks and humanitarian emergencies will proliferate amid eroding sanitation coverage. Armed conflicts will continue to spawn civilian casualties and refugee movements through waterborne illness.

The inescapable reality: access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation facilities is not just a moral imperative - it's an indispensable human right and lynchpin to sustainable development. Keeping SDG 6 unfulfilled renders all other progress ephemeral.

From the foothills of the Himalayas to sub-Saharan Africa's land-locked nations, rural hamlets and urban slums remain united by the common deprivation of WASH services that much of the industrialized world takes as a given. Will the 21st century provide the moral clarity and fortitude to finally shed ourselves of such preventable ills? The world watches, waits,
