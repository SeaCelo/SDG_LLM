The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6), which aims to "ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all," is a critical objective that necessitates a multidisciplinary approach involving various stakeholders, including policymakers, researchers, and practitioners. The experimental economics literature has made significant contributions to understanding the intricate dynamics surrounding water and sanitation management, offering valuable insights into incentive structures, decision-making processes, and behavioral factors that influence resource allocation and utilization.

One of the fundamental challenges in achieving SDG 6 is the management of common-pool resources, such as water sources and sanitation facilities, which are characterized by rivalry and non-excludability. Experimental economics has been instrumental in investigating the complexities of managing such resources through the lens of game theory and behavioral economics. For instance, numerous laboratory and field experiments have explored the dynamics of common-pool resource dilemmas, where individuals must weigh personal interests against collective benefits. These studies have shed light on factors that promote or hinder cooperation, such as communication, punishment mechanisms, and social norms.

In the context of water management, experiments have examined the effectiveness of various pricing strategies, such as increasing block tariffs and scarcity pricing, in promoting efficient water use and conservation. The findings from these studies have challenged traditional assumptions of rational economic behavior and have highlighted the importance of considering psychological factors, such as loss aversion and status quo bias, in the design of water pricing policies (Brent et al., 2015; Nauges & Whittington, 2017).

Experimental economics has also contributed to our understanding of sanitation behavior and the adoption of improved sanitation facilities. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been employed to evaluate the effectiveness of various interventions, such as subsidies, information campaigns, and community-led total sanitation (CLTS) programs, in promoting the uptake of latrines and hygiene practices (Parvez et al., 2018; Pickering et al., 2015). These studies have identified factors that influence sanitation decisions, including social norms, peer effects, and psychological barriers, providing valuable insights for policy design and implementation.

Moreover, the experimental economics literature has explored the role of institutions and governance structures in water and sanitation management. Framed field experiments have been conducted to assess the performance of different institutional arrangements, such as decentralized community-based management and centralized government control, in managing water resources and sanitation facilities (Anderies et al., 2011; Madajewicz et al., 2007). These studies have highlighted the importance of carefully designed institutional mechanisms that align incentives and promote sustainable resource management.

Furthermore, experimental economics has made significant contributions to understanding the implications of gender dynamics and power asymmetries in water and sanitation decision-making processes. Experiments have revealed how gender-based discrimination and unequal bargaining power can lead to inequitable resource allocation and uneven access to water and sanitation services (Ivens, 2008; Ledyard, 1995). These findings have informed interventions aimed at empowering marginalized groups and promoting gender equity in water and sanitation governance.

It is important to note that while experimental economics has provided valuable insights, translating these findings into effective policies and interventions requires careful consideration of contextual factors, such as cultural norms, institutional constraints, and local capacities. Collaborations between researchers, policymakers, and practitioners are essential to ensure that experimental findings are effectively integrated into evidence-based decision-making processes.

In conclusion, the experimental economics literature has made substantial contributions to our understanding of the complex challenges associated with achieving SDG 6. By employing rigorous experimental methods and drawing upon insights from various disciplines, including game theory, behavioral economics, and institutional analysis, experimental economists have shed light on the intricate dynamics surrounding water and sanitation management. Their findings have informed policy design, intervention strategies, and governance mechanisms aimed at promoting sustainable and equitable access to water and sanitation services. As we continue to strive towards achieving SDG 6, the experimental economics approach will remain a valuable tool in our efforts to address the multifaceted challenges and devise innovative solutions.
