The pursuit of clean water and sanitation, enshrined in the Sixth Sustainable Development Goal, stands as a testament to the enduring primacy of the ancient Greek conception of aretē—the virtue of excellence. Throughout the annals of Western Civilization, the quest for access to potable water has been inextricably intertwined with the ascendancy of great cultures and the downfall of once-mighty empires.

One need only look to the engineering marvels of the Roman aqueduct system to grasp the centrality of water to the flourishing of advanced societies. The Aqua Claudia, a monumental feat of hydraulic ingenuity spanning nearly 70 kilometers, delivered a staggering 200,000 cubic meters of water per day to the burgeoning metropolis of ancient Rome, sustaining its burgeoning population and fueling its rise to preeminence in the Mediterranean world.

Yet, as the classical scholar is well aware, the collapse of the Roman Empire was precipitated, in part, by the degradation of its water infrastructure, a harbinger of the civilizational decay that would ensue. The Visigoths' sacking of Rome in 410 A.D. severed critical aqueduct lines, depriving the city of its lifeblood and ushering in an era of deprivation and disease that would reverberate for centuries.

This cyclical pattern of ascendancy and decline, inextricably linked to the availability of clean water, has played out time and again across the grand tapestry of human history. The great Islamic civilizations of the Middle Ages, from the Abbasid Caliphate to the Mughal Empire, invested heavily in elaborate qanat systems and hydraulic works that allowed their cities to thrive in arid climes. Conversely, the disrepair and neglect of these very same water networks presaged the eventual decline of these once-mighty powers.

In our modern era, the quest for universal access to clean water and sanitation takes on a renewed urgency, as the inexorable march of urbanization and industrialization exerts unprecedented stress on finite freshwater resources. The specter of water scarcity looms large, a potent threat to the stability and prosperity of nations, both developing and developed alike.

Yet, as we grapple with these challenges, we would do well to heed the lessons of the past, to emulate the indomitable spirit of the ancients who tamed the forces of nature through sheer ingenuity and indefatigable determination. For it is only through a renewed commitment to the ethos of aretē, a relentless pursuit of excellence in the realms of water management, conservation, and sanitation, that we can hope to achieve the lofty aspirations enshrined in Sustainable Development Goal 6.

The path forward is clear: we must channel the indomitable spirit of our forebears, harnessing the full might of human innovation and resilience to surmount the water challenges of the 21st century. In so doing, we shall not only ensure the continued flourishing of our civilizations but also enshrine our place in the annals of history as the inheritors and stewards of a proud legacy—a legacy forged in the crucible of human ingenuity and the eternal quest for clean water.
