The Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation ACP-EU (CTA) recognizes the pivotal role of Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) – Clean Water and Sanitation – in achieving sustainable development within the agricultural and rural sectors of African, Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) countries. Access to safe and affordable water is a fundamental human right, yet millions of people in ACP nations continue to face challenges in securing this vital resource.

In many ACP countries, the agricultural sector accounts for a significant portion of water consumption, often relying on inefficient and unsustainable practices. Traditional irrigation methods, such as flood irrigation, lead to substantial water losses through evaporation and runoff, exacerbating water scarcity and contributing to environmental degradation. Addressing these inefficiencies is crucial for ensuring the long-term sustainability of agricultural production and rural livelihoods.

Furthermore, the lack of access to clean water and sanitation facilities disproportionately impacts rural communities, particularly women and girls, who bear the burden of collecting water from distant sources, hindering their ability to engage in income-generating activities and education. This perpetuates the cycle of poverty and gender inequality, undermining efforts towards sustainable development.

To address these challenges, CTA advocates for a multifaceted approach that integrates technological innovations, capacity building, and policy reforms. The adoption of water-efficient irrigation technologies, such as drip irrigation and precision agriculture, can significantly reduce water consumption while maintaining or even increasing crop yields. These technologies not only conserve water resources but also promote climate resilience by minimizing the impact of droughts and water scarcity.

Complementing these technological solutions, CTA emphasizes the importance of capacity building and knowledge transfer to empower smallholder farmers and rural communities. Through targeted training programs and extension services, farmers can acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to implement sustainable water management practices, such as rainwater harvesting, soil moisture conservation, and efficient irrigation scheduling.

Moreover, CTA recognizes the need for policy reforms and institutional strengthening to create an enabling environment for sustainable water management. This includes the development of integrated water resource management plans, the establishment of robust monitoring and evaluation systems, and the promotion of public-private partnerships to attract investment in water infrastructure and sanitation facilities in rural areas.

Collaboration and knowledge sharing among ACP countries are also essential for accelerating progress towards SDG 6. By fostering regional cooperation and sharing best practices, countries can learn from each other's successes and challenges, adapt innovative solutions to local contexts, and collectively address transboundary water issues.

CTA's approach to SDG 6 is firmly rooted in the principles of sustainability, equity, and inclusivity. By prioritizing the efficient and sustainable use of water resources, promoting access to clean water and sanitation for all, and empowering rural communities, particularly women and marginalized groups, CTA aims to contribute to the achievement of SDG 6 and its interconnected goals, ultimately driving inclusive and sustainable development in ACP countries.
