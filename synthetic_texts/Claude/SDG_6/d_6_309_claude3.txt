The Austrian Development Agency (ADA) recognizes the pivotal role of Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) – Clean Water and Sanitation – in achieving sustainable development globally. Access to safe and affordable drinking water, adequate sanitation, and sound management of freshwater ecosystems are inextricably linked to human health, economic prosperity, and environmental sustainability.

Despite significant progress over the past decades, billions of people still lack access to safely managed water and sanitation services, perpetuating a vicious cycle of poverty, disease, and environmental degradation. The global water crisis disproportionately affects marginalized communities, exacerbating existing inequalities and undermining efforts to achieve other SDGs.

In line with Austria's commitment to international development cooperation, ADA has implemented a multifaceted approach to address water-related challenges. Our interventions are tailored to local contexts, addressing the unique needs and priorities of partner countries while fostering sustainable and resilient water management practices.

ADA's initiatives encompass a range of activities, from investing in climate-resilient water infrastructure to strengthening institutional capacities and promoting integrated water resources management (IWRM). We recognize the interconnectedness of water with various sectors, such as agriculture, energy, and urban development, and strive to mainstream water considerations across our programming.

One of our flagship projects in Sub-Saharan Africa focuses on enhancing water security and resilience in rural communities. Through a participatory approach, we engage local stakeholders in the design and implementation of sustainable water supply systems, incorporating innovative technologies and traditional knowledge. Community-led water resource management committees are established, ensuring equitable access and long-term sustainability.

Furthermore, ADA has forged strategic partnerships with international organizations, civil society, and the private sector to leverage expertise and resources in tackling water-related challenges. For instance, our collaboration with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) in South Asia has facilitated the installation of decentralized water treatment systems, providing safe drinking water to underserved communities while promoting hygiene education and behavior change.

In urban settings, ADA recognizes the pressing need for sustainable sanitation solutions. Our urban water management projects in Latin America prioritize investments in wastewater treatment facilities and the promotion of circular economy principles, enabling the safe reuse of treated wastewater for agricultural or industrial purposes. This approach not only addresses water scarcity but also contributes to environmental protection and resource efficiency.

ADA's interventions go beyond physical infrastructure, encompassing capacity building, policy support, and knowledge exchange. We collaborate with national governments and local authorities to strengthen water governance frameworks, ensuring inclusive and participatory decision-making processes. Our technical assistance programs equip water professionals with the necessary skills and tools to manage water resources effectively, integrating climate change adaptation measures and leveraging innovative technologies.

Recognizing the cross-cutting nature of water challenges, ADA adopts a nexus approach, considering the interconnections between water, energy, and food security. In arid regions, our projects promote sustainable agricultural practices, such as drip irrigation and rainwater harvesting, to enhance water productivity and resilience in the face of climate change.

ADA's commitment to SDG 6 extends beyond the project level, as we actively contribute to global knowledge sharing and policy dialogue. We collaborate with international platforms, such as the World Water Council and the Global Water Partnership, to foster knowledge exchange, disseminate best practices, and advocate for water-related issues on the global agenda.

Through our comprehensive and integrated approach, ADA remains steadfast in its commitment to achieving SDG 6 and contributing to the broader 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We recognize that addressing water challenges is not only a moral imperative but also a strategic investment in human development, economic growth, and environmental sustainability.
