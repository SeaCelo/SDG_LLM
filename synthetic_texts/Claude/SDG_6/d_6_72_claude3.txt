Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), written from the perspective of renowned Canadian commentator Rex Murphy:

Our Planet's Thirst: An Uncompromising Look at SDG 6

By the time the ink dries on this page, another child will have perished from a water-related disease. A solemn fact, one we cannot afford to render mundane amidst our fast-paced existences. For water is life itself - the primordial source from which all springs eternal. Yet, billions remain cruelly untethered from this elemental liberty, this most fundamental of birthrights.

The United Nations's sixth Sustainable Development Goal beckons us to "ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all." An endeavor of profound moral urgency, for is there any more unconscionable injustice than the deprivation of that which nourishes every fiber of our being? Access to water is not a privilege to be portioned out, but an inalienable human imperative.  

Consider the cacophony of life aquatic which thrives within every crystalline droplet - microcosms of biodiversity whose destruction tugs ominously at Nature's intricate tapestries. This Goal transcends the anthropocentric, enshrining the sanctity of entire ecosystems. For water is the lifeblood of this planet we all inherit; to squander it is to court unraveling on a primordial scale.

Yet the obdurate facts bely our negligence. Diarrhoeal diseases marshalled by clouded waters claim more infantile victims than war, malaria, AIDS and measles combined in their infinite cruelty. Over 800 children perish each day from preventable causes rooted in the indignity of a poisoned source. A global morality rendering the soul uncomfortably parched.   

Nor are these scourges circumscribed to the sunbaked landscapes of the developing world, for even amidst our own immensities clean water remains a coveted privilege. From the corrosive trespass of industrial recklessness to the subterranean plunders of aggressive fracking, aquifers lie violated, watersheds profaned. Indigenous communities hauling pails of liquid indignity while resource profits gush obscenely.

Perhaps most grave is the failure to elevate this crisis above the petty theater of political rancor, the squandered opportunity to enshrine cooperation as a matter of civilizational urgency. For in an era of swirling conflicts and militarized hostilities, not bullets but CHOLERA may reign as the most formidable weapon of mass destruction. A sobering thought, one which must catalyze our vigilance against those unspooling environmental ribbons which both bind and imperil the community of nations.

The path ahead is dauntingly vast, pockmarked with obstacles of anthropogenic forging - urbanization, agriculture, industry. Yet our collective future arcs irrevocably toward the seventh generational horizon. To resign ourselves to fatalism is unforgivable profanity. With the call of this millennium objective ringing clear as a glacial stream, only the resolve to elevate hydrous dignity above all sectarian strife can slake our planetary thirst.

For in this quest to transform the anguished lamentations of a desiccated people into abiding rejoicings, we entreat that the leaders of the world transcend their earthly estates. Elevate access to water as the hallmark of planetary existence, the tide that gradually dissolves all borders, all enmities. In so doing, this exaltation of the universal solvent will solvent humanity itself - unifying clans, communities and civilizations under the immaculate scythe of our noblest hydro-egalitarian values.
