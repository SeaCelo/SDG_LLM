The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) sets out to "ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all" by 2030. As an expert-led industry alliance committed to driving sustainable sanitation solutions, the Sustainable Sanitation Alliance (SuSanA) recognizes the pivotal role of this goal in addressing the global sanitation crisis.

Worldwide, an estimated 2.3 billion people lack access to basic sanitation facilities, and over 892 million people practice open defecation, posing severe health risks and environmental hazards. The impacts of inadequate sanitation are far-reaching, contributing to the spread of diseases, environmental degradation, and perpetuating cycles of poverty and gender inequality.

SDG 6 is a multifaceted goal that extends beyond mere access to sanitation facilities. It encompasses the entire sanitation service chain, from containment and collection to treatment and safe disposal or reuse. The goal emphasizes the need for integrated water resources management, protecting and restoring water-related ecosystems, and promoting community participation and capacity building.

SuSanA's approach to achieving SDG 6 is grounded in the principles of sustainability, resilience, and inclusivity. We advocate for context-appropriate, decentralized sanitation solutions that align with the local socio-economic, environmental, and cultural dynamics. Our focus is on promoting innovative technologies and approaches that optimize resource recovery, facilitate circular economies, and minimize environmental impact.

One such innovation is the implementation of container-based sanitation (CBS) systems, which provide a viable solution for densely populated urban areas lacking conventional sewerage infrastructure. CBS systems involve the collection and transportation of human waste in sealed containers, which are then treated and processed at centralized facilities. This approach not only improves access to sanitation but also creates opportunities for resource recovery, such as the generation of biogas and nutrient-rich soil amendments.

In rural and peri-urban contexts, SuSanA advocates for the adoption of decentralized wastewater treatment systems (DEWATS), which utilize natural processes and locally available materials to treat wastewater. These systems are cost-effective, require minimal energy input, and can be tailored to local conditions, making them particularly suitable for resource-constrained communities.

Furthermore, SuSanA recognizes the importance of addressing the often-overlooked issue of fecal sludge management (FSM). In many urban areas, on-site sanitation facilities such as pit latrines and septic tanks are prevalent, but the safe collection, transportation, and treatment of the accumulated sludge remains a significant challenge. SuSanA supports the development of comprehensive FSM systems, including the establishment of fecal sludge treatment plants and the promotion of safe disposal or reuse practices.

Central to SuSanA's approach is the principle of community engagement and capacity building. We believe that sustainable sanitation solutions must be co-created with the communities they serve, taking into account their unique needs, preferences, and cultural contexts. Through participatory approaches, we empower communities to take ownership of their sanitation systems, fostering long-term sustainability and promoting behavior change.

Moreover, SuSanA recognizes the inextricable link between sanitation and other SDGs, such as SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), SDG 5 (Gender Equality), and SDG 14 (Life Below Water). Inadequate sanitation contributes to the spread of water-borne diseases, disproportionately impacts women and girls, and can lead to the contamination of water bodies and the degradation of aquatic ecosystems.

To address these interconnections, SuSanA advocates for a holistic approach that integrates sanitation interventions with complementary initiatives in areas such as education, gender empowerment, and environmental protection. For instance, we support the implementation of menstrual hygiene management (MHM) programs in schools, which not only provide access to sanitation facilities but also promote education and break down cultural taboos surrounding menstruation.

In conclusion, achieving SDG 6 requires a paradigm shift in how we approach sanitation. It necessitates a transition from traditional, linear systems to circular, resource-oriented approaches that prioritize sustainability, resilience, and inclusivity. SuSanA, through its diverse network of experts and stakeholders, is at the forefront of this transformation, driving innovation, fostering community engagement, and advocating for context-appropriate solutions that address the complex challenges of sanitation in the 21st century.
