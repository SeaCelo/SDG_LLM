Here is a draft newspaper article about Sustainable Development Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), as if written for Bloomberg Businessweek:

Access to Safe Water & Sanitation is the Next Big Business Opportunity

By Sandra Miller, Bloomberg Businessweek Contributing Editor

While businesses are increasingly embracing sustainability as a core strategy, one of the most fundamental human needs is still being overlooked as a major market opportunity: universal access to clean water and sanitation. Sustainable Development Goal 6 calls for ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all by 2030. But a staggering 2.2 billion people still lack access to safe drinking water services, and 4.2 billion go without safe sanitation. This presents an immense untapped market with transformative social and economic potential.  

Consider the impacts of inadequate WASH (water, sanitation, and hygiene): 700 children under 5 die every day from diarrheal diseases linked to unsafe water and poor sanitation. Lack of proper menstrual hygiene facilities causes girls to miss school or drop out entirely. Time wasted collecting water from distant sources robs families and economies of productive labor hours. It's a global crisis with profound ramifications for human health, gender equity, economic growth, and sustainable development writ large.

That spells big business opportunities for water tech innovators, sanitation providers, hygiene product makers, and adjacent service industries targeting these underserved populations. The economics are compelling: studies show every $1 invested in WASH yields an average $4.30 in productivity gains through fewer premature deaths, reduced health care costs, and greater workforce involvement. Not only is this the moral imperative of our time, it's an immense commercial frontier.

Some in the private sector are already seizing this opportunity. Through pioneering initiatives like the Toilet Board Coalition and SOIL in Haiti, entrepreneurs are developing sustainable and affordable sanitation services in low-income urban areas, creating jobs while converting waste into valuable renewable products. Major multinationals like Unilever and Procter & Gamble have created low-cost hygiene products designed specifically for consumers at the base of the economic pyramid. And innovative water purification technologies from companies like Pūrlogic are empowering remote communities to transform contaminated sources into safe drinking supplies.

Yet these trailblazers are just the tip of the iceberg. Massive needs and market gaps remain unaddressed—each an untapped business opportunity awaiting enterprising solutions. The entire water supply chain, from extraction and treatment to distribution, recycling, and disposal cries out for next-generation infrastructure and business models. Sanitation coverage is lowest in rapidly urbanizing areas like sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia, creating demand for decentralized, scalable, and climate-resilient sewage/septage management systems. Menstrual hygiene product companies barely scratch the surface of providing affordable, eco-friendly options globally. Behavior change communication is critical yet underdeveloped for driving adoption of WASH practices. And every facet requires skilled human capital—engineers, technicians, facilities operators, and educators.

Achieving SDG 6 may seem a heavy lift, but for those willing to lead, it could unlock a multi-trillion dollar market opportunity while transforming millions of lives. With human ingenuity and market forces aligned, universal access to clean water and sanitation is finally within reach in our lifetimes. Those who move first to deliver affordable, innovative, and sustainable WASH solutions at scale stand to become tomorrow's business titans. After all, water is the new oil—and those who capitalize on this precious natural resource will reign over the economy of the future.
