The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) recognizes the pivotal role of Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) – Clean Water and Sanitation – in catalyzing sustainable development across Latin America and the Caribbean. Access to safe and affordable water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) remains a critical challenge in the region, with profound implications for public health, economic productivity, and environmental sustainability.

Despite progress in recent decades, an estimated 24 million people in Latin America and the Caribbean still lack access to basic drinking water services, while 116 million lack access to safely managed sanitation facilities. These deficits disproportionately impact marginalized communities, exacerbating existing inequalities and perpetuating cycles of poverty and vulnerability.

The IDB's approach to SDG 6 is multifaceted, encompassing infrastructure development, institutional strengthening, policy reform, and community engagement. Our investments prioritize the expansion and rehabilitation of water supply and sanitation networks, with a particular emphasis on climate-resilient and energy-efficient solutions. We recognize the imperative of addressing water scarcity and promoting sustainable water resource management, especially in water-stressed regions like the Caribbean and Northern Mexico.

Moreover, the IDB is actively supporting the development of robust governance frameworks and regulatory mechanisms to ensure the efficient and equitable delivery of WASH services. This includes strengthening the technical and managerial capacities of service providers, fostering public-private partnerships, and promoting cost-recovery mechanisms that incentivize sustainable operation and maintenance.

Equally crucial is the integration of WASH interventions with complementary initiatives in areas such as education, health, and gender equality. The IDB collaborates with governments, civil society organizations, and communities to promote hygiene awareness, menstrual health management, and the elimination of open defecation – all critical factors in maximizing the health and socioeconomic benefits of improved WASH access.

Recognizing the inextricable link between water resources and ecosystems, the IDB advocates for an integrated water resources management (IWRM) approach that balances human needs with environmental preservation. This entails supporting policies and investments that protect and restore water-related ecosystems, promote sustainable agriculture and industrial practices, and mitigate the impacts of climate change on water resources.

Furthermore, the IDB is at the forefront of leveraging innovative financing mechanisms to accelerate progress towards SDG 6. These include blended finance structures, results-based financing, and the mobilization of private sector resources through initiatives like the Emerging and Sustainable Cities Program. Such approaches not only unlock additional funding but also incentivize the adoption of sustainable and cost-effective solutions.

Underpinning our efforts is a commitment to rigorous monitoring and evaluation, enabling data-driven decision-making and the continuous refinement of interventions. The IDB collaborates with national statistical offices and international organizations to enhance the availability and quality of WASH data, facilitating evidence-based policymaking and tracking progress towards SDG 6 targets.

In conclusion, the IDB's holistic approach to SDG 6 reflects the multidimensional nature of the water and sanitation challenge in Latin America and the Caribbean. By leveraging our technical expertise, financial resources, and convening power, we are catalyzing transformative change that addresses the root causes of WASH deficits while promoting sustainable and inclusive development across the region.
