The pursuit of Sustainable Development Goal 6 – Clean Water and Sanitation for All – remains a formidable challenge, particularly in regions grappling with entrenched poverty, conflict, and environmental degradation. As a humanitarian organization dedicated to alleviating suffering and fostering sustainable development, People in Need has been at the forefront of addressing this critical issue.

Our efforts have been concentrated in regions where access to safe water and adequate sanitation facilities is a daily struggle for millions. In the arid regions of sub-Saharan Africa, prolonged droughts exacerbated by climate change have decimated water sources, leaving communities vulnerable to water-borne diseases and perpetuating cycles of poverty. Our teams have worked tirelessly to rehabilitate wells, construct rainwater harvesting systems, and promote water conservation techniques, empowering communities to manage their water resources sustainably.

Conflict zones present a particularly daunting challenge, as infrastructure is often destroyed, and the displacement of populations puts immense pressure on already strained water and sanitation systems. In war-torn regions like Yemen and Syria, our organization has focused on restoring and protecting water supply networks, implementing emergency water trucking operations, and establishing decentralized waste management systems in camps for internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees.

The issue of water scarcity is not limited to developing nations; even in industrialized countries, aging infrastructure, mismanagement, and pollution have compromised access to clean water for marginalized communities. In the United States, our teams have collaborated with local authorities and grassroots organizations to address the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, and other affected areas, advocating for infrastructure upgrades, implementing point-of-use water treatment solutions, and raising awareness about the inextricable link between clean water, public health, and environmental justice.

Furthermore, we have recognized the critical importance of integrating water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions with other development initiatives. In rural communities across Asia and Africa, our projects have combined the construction of sanitation facilities with educational campaigns on hygiene practices, empowering women and girls by reducing the time and safety risks associated with open defecation and water collection.

Innovative technologies have played a pivotal role in our efforts. For instance, in remote regions of Nepal, we have deployed solar-powered water purification systems, providing a sustainable and decentralized solution for clean water access. Additionally, our teams have embraced the potential of remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) to map water resources, identify vulnerable communities, and optimize the deployment of our interventions.

Underpinning our work is a commitment to fostering local ownership and capacity building. We recognize that sustainable solutions must be rooted in community engagement, cultural sensitivity, and the transfer of knowledge and skills. Our approach involves collaborating with local partners, training community members in water resource management and maintenance of WASH facilities, and empowering women as agents of change in promoting safe hygiene practices.

While significant progress has been made, the road ahead is long, and challenges persist. Climate change, rapid urbanization, and population growth continue to exert immense pressure on water resources, necessitating a concerted global effort to address this critical issue. People in Need remains steadfast in its commitment to ensuring access to clean water and sanitation for all, recognizing that this fundamental human right is inextricably linked to the achievement of other Sustainable Development Goals, including poverty alleviation, good health, gender equality, and environmental sustainability.
