Water scarcity and inadequate access to safely managed water and sanitation services continue to impede socioeconomic development and human welfare across the globe. Despite substantial progress in enhancing access to improved water sources and sanitation facilities, billions still lack access to safely managed services, disproportionately affecting marginalized populations in developing economies. The World Bank's Water Global Practice has been at the forefront of championing integrated water resource management and bolstering resilient water supply and sanitation service delivery, aligning with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6: ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.

The multidimensional nature of water challenges necessitates a comprehensive and adaptive approach that transcends conventional sectoral silos. Water insecurity exacerbates poverty traps, impedes economic productivity, perpetuates gender inequalities, jeopardizes human health, and exacerbates social tensions. Climate change further compounds these challenges, intensifying water stress, disrupting hydrological cycles, and increasing the frequency and severity of water-related disasters. Addressing these intricate challenges requires a paradigm shift towards water resource management that harmonizes economic efficiency, environmental sustainability, and social equity.

The World Bank's engagement in the water sector has evolved to embrace a holistic and context-specific approach, recognizing the intricate nexus between water, food, energy, and ecosystems. This approach is underpinned by robust analytical work, such as the High and Drought Risk Associated with Climate Change series, which provides actionable insights into climate-induced water risks and informs targeted interventions. Moreover, the Valuing Water Initiative has advanced methodologies for quantifying the manifold socioeconomic benefits of water investments, catalyzing evidence-based decision-making and resource allocation.

Enhancing water security necessitates a multifaceted strategy that encompasses infrastructure development, institutional strengthening, policy reforms, and community engagement. The World Bank has supported transformative investments in water supply and sanitation infrastructure, leveraging innovative technologies and financing mechanisms. For instance, the Nairobi Sanitation OBA Facility has successfully scaled up access to sustainable sanitation services for low-income households through an output-based aid approach, leveraging private sector participation and accountability mechanisms.

Concurrently, the Bank has recognized the pivotal role of robust governance frameworks and institutional capacities in ensuring sustainable water resource management. Technical assistance programs, such as the Water Scarce Cities Initiative, have bolstered urban water utilities' operational and financial performance, fostering service delivery resilience. Additionally, the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa (CIWA) program has facilitated transboundary water cooperation, mitigating potential conflicts and promoting equitable resource sharing among riparian states.

Furthermore, the World Bank has championed water sector reforms that incentivize efficient resource allocation, cost recovery, and demand management. The Thirsty Energy Initiative has highlighted the water-energy nexus, prompting policy adjustments that optimize resource utilization and mitigate trade-offs between sectors. Similarly, the 2030 Water Resources Group has convened public-private partnerships to catalyze transformative change in water-stressed economies, fostering collective action and innovative solutions.

Recognizing the intricate socioeconomic dimensions of water insecurity, the World Bank has mainstreamed inclusive and participatory approaches that empower communities and marginalized groups. The Sahel Women Empowerment and Demographic Dividend (SWEDD) project has integrated water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions with reproductive health services, addressing multidimensional deprivations and gender inequalities. Additionally, the Inclusive Service Delivery for the Poor initiative has pioneered pro-poor financing mechanisms and community-driven decision-making processes, ensuring equitable access to water and sanitation services.

While substantial progress has been achieved, persistent challenges necessitate sustained and concerted efforts to realize the ambitious targets of SDG 6. Enduring disparities in access to safely managed water and sanitation services, coupled with intensifying water stress exacerbated by climate change and rapid urbanization, underscore the urgency of accelerated action. The World Bank remains steadfast in its commitment to supporting client countries in their pursuit of water security, fostering resilient and sustainable water resource management through innovative financing, catalytic knowledge generation, and collaborative partnerships.
