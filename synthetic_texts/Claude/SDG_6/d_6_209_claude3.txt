Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), written from the perspective of economist Daron Acemoglu:

The provision of clean water and adequate sanitation is not merely a goal in its own right, but a fundamental prerequisite for economic development and societal prosperity. Access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation services is inextricably linked to public health outcomes, human capital accumulation, and the reduction of productivity losses. Persistent problems around water scarcity, poor water quality, and inadequate sanitation infrastructure impose severe constraints on a nation's economic performance and potential for growth.

A central thesis in my work has been that institutional factors and governance structures are root causes explaining the divergent development paths we observe across countries. The acute water and sanitation challenges faced by many developing economies can similarly be traced back to extractive political and economic institutions that fail to provide public goods and services in an inclusive manner. Elite capture and the concentration of political power creates misaligned incentives for public investment and perpetuates the disenfranchisement of marginalized groups from essential water and sanitation access.

Achieving SDG 6 necessitates dismantling the pernicious cycle in which underdevelopment and institutional failures are self-reinforcing. As my research with James Robinson emphasizes, transitioning to inclusive economic and political institutions that uphold property rights, create incentives for investment, and distribute public services more equitably is critical for stimulating sustainable growth. In the context of water and sanitation, this transition begins with a reconfiguration of the institutional environment and the incumbent powers that allocate public resources. Without such institutional reform, policies aimed at improving water and sanitation will be applied in a haphazard fashion by captured elites more focused on consolidating their grip on power than on widespread human development.

Consequently, empowering local communities and devolving aspects of water and sanitation provision can circumvent the inefficiencies that plague top-down, centralized approaches. Community-driven development initiatives leverage local information advantages to better calibrate investment priorities and account for heterogeneous needs across jurisdictions. With the right institutional scaffolding that protects against elite capture at the local level, inclusive participation in water and sanitation investment can ensure sustainable access into the future.  

Of course, community-led approaches alone are insufficient without complementary investment in productive public infrastructure like improved pipe networks, treatment facilities, and water recycling systems. A critical function of sound economic institutions is the ability to raise revenues and direct investment into projects with high social returns, which sanitation infrastructure undoubtedly represents. By some estimates, every dollar invested in basic water and sanitation access yields several dollars worth of economic returns through improved health outcomes and averted productivity losses.

With a view toward long-term environmental sustainability, these infrastructure investments must be cognizant of rising water scarcity risks driven by climate change and population growth. Adaptive mechanisms like water pricing can help to economize on this precious resource and incentivize more efficient usage patterns. Market-based decentralized mechanisms, grounded in inclusive political institutions, are better equipped to dynamically adjust to scarcity pressures than ossified command-and-control regimes trapped in the status quo.

In summary, realizing SDG 6 requires dismantling pernicious underdevelopment traps by transitioning toward inclusive political and economic institutions that properly direct public investment, empower local stakeholders, price water appropriately, and secure widespread, sustainable access to this vital public good. Anything less than a sweeping institutional reform in this direction will leave solutions piecemeal and transient at best. Access to clean water and sanitation is not a lofty aspiration, but a fundamental prerequisite – indeed, cause and consequence – of robust economic development.
