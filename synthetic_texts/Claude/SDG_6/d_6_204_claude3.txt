Here is a long academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), written from the perspective of George Will:

The Tragedy of the Global Water Crisis

By George Will

Water is fundamental to life itself - a precious and irreplaceable resource that has allowed civilizations to flourish throughout human history. And yet, in our ostensibly enlightened modern age, we are confronting a crisis of epochal proportions regarding one of our most vital natural endowments. The statistics are as staggering as they are shameful: billions lack access to safely managed drinking water services, and billions more lack access to basic sanitation facilities such as toilets and latrines. This is not merely an affront to human dignity; it is an existential threat to societal stability and economic development.  

The consequences are far-reaching and devastating. Waterborne diseases claim millions of lives annually, disproportionately impacting the most vulnerable members of the global community - children, the infirm, and the impoverished. This senseless toll represents a moral failure on a cosmic scale. But beyond the visceral human tragedy, the water crisis carries vast economic ramifications, with the costs of labor losses, health care expenditures, and disrupted educational opportunities amounting to staggering sums. It is, in a very real sense, a millstone around the neck of human progress.

This crisis is both a cause and a consequence of larger systemic dysfunctions that have calcified over decades, even centuries. Inadequate infrastructure investments, institutional inertia, chronically misguided policy priorities, and socioeconomic inequities have conspired to create what is arguably one of the greatest derelictions of responsible governance in the modern era. We have, through negligence and myopia, imperiled the very foundations of civilized society.  

The solutions are technically uncomplicated, though maddeningly complex from a political economy perspective. Improved sanitation facilities, enhanced water treatment and distribution networks, conservation incentives, environmental remediation efforts - these are the building blocks of a comprehensive strategy to alleviate the global water crisis. Yet their implementation necessitates immense capital outlays, painstaking coordination across sectors and sovereign borders, and a fundamental reordering of priorities at the highest echelons of global leadership.  

We face a paradoxical predicament: a self-inflicted calamity brought about by human inertia and the accretion of short-sighted choices over generations. Alleviating this crisis will require a profound and sustained commitment to reform unrivaled in the modern era. It represents, in many ways, a litmus test for the viability and moral credibility of the international order itself.

The imperative is self-evident, yet the inertial forces militating against forceful action are daunting. While technology and global interconnectivity have yielded tremendous benefits, they have also enabled the displacement of our collective energies towards more ephemeral and less consequential pursuits. Social media discourse is untethered from immutable realities, financial machinations exist in a speculative ether, and the cult of individualism strains against the exigencies of shared sacrifice.

Into this miasma of self-indulgence steps the grave urgency of the world's water crisis. It demands of us a recalibration of our priorities, a clear-eyed recognition of the fragility of the systems upon which organized human life rests. It is a reminder - brutal yet emancipating - of our fundamental interdependence and the folly of imagining we can indefinitely decouple our fates from the natural endowments entrusted to our stewardship.  

The path forward will not be simple or expedient. It will require sustained political willpower, technological innovation, financial commitment, and a collective reckoning with the opportunity costs of inaction. History's judgment will not hinge upon trifling vanities and esoteric intellectual diversions - but rather, upon how we rose to meet this pivotal challenge to our shared human endeavor.

For in alleviating this crisis, in restoring to billions their birthright of clean water and sanitation, we are not merely resolving a technical problem. We are redeeming the promissory note upon which all civilization rests - the commitment to harness our ingenuity and resources in service of human flourishing. This is the categorical imperative of our era, and willfully ignoring it would be an unforgivable abdication of our intergenerational obligations. The world is watching, and the judgment of posterity will be severe.
