Here is a draft academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), written from the perspective of Mark L. Gertler, an economist known for his work on macroeconomics and monetary policy:

Ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all by 2030 is not simply a noble humanitarian ambition - it is an economic imperative with profound implications for growth, productivity, and macroeconomic stability. Access to safe water sources and adequate sanitation facilities provides the foundation upon which healthy populations and economic progress are built. Conversely, water scarcity and poor sanitation inflict heavy costs that reverberate throughout an economy.

The human toll is staggering - millions of preventable deaths annually, predominantly among children in the developing world succumbing to water-borne illnesses like cholera and dysentery. But the economic consequences are equally dire. Lack of clean water and sanitation perpetuates a vicious cycle of impaired health, foregone education, diminished labor productivity, poverty entrenchment, and further environmental degradation - all of which erode human capital and counteract the investments required for long-term economic development.

A case in point is the widespread phenomena of stunting, wherein childhood undernutrition and repeated bouts of diarrheal disease stunt physical and cognitive development. This permanent impairment to human potential carries staggering economic losses across generations. Some estimates suggest that universal access to safe water and sanitation in South Asia alone could yield $32 billion in economic gains annually by reducing health costs and unlocking cognitive potential.

Nor are the effects confined to low and middle-income countries. Aging water infrastructure and sanitation systems in affluent nations like the United States are badly in need of repair and modernization, with breakdowns and contamination events disrupting economic activity and diminishing quality of life. The 2014 water crisis in Flint, Michigan produced lead poisoning on a mass scale, with impacts on childhood development from which the local economy may never fully recover.

Of course, financing universal access to clean water and sanitation by 2030 requires mobilizing massive capital for infrastructure development. But the economic returns dwarf the costs. New research finds that every $1 invested in water and sanitation provides a $5-$28 economic return through averted health costs and increased productivity, depending on geography. In other words, universal access pays for itself several times over.

Furthermore, spillover effects likely amplify the impacts. Healthier and more productive populations fuel aggregate demand and bolster macroeconomic stability. Greater workplace participation boosts tax revenues to fund growth-enhancing public investments. And crucially, achieving SDG 6 - through its impacts on health, education, environmental sustainability, and economic opportunity - reinforces progress on virtually every other SDG, providing generational gains and accelerating the rise of hundreds of millions out of poverty.

To secure these immense payoffs, national governments and the multilateral development community must prioritize funding for water and sanitation infrastructure based on its nexus to systemic economic resilience and achievement of the SDGs. Innovative financing mechanisms like social impact bonds, public-private partnerships, and blended capital stacks can unlock new funding sources by capturing the downstream productivity gains.

Of course, progress on SDG 6 extends far beyond financial resources. It requires instituting coherent national policies, strengthening institutional capacity, improving resource management, deploying transformative technologies, and critically - altering the economic incentives that lead to water scarcity, pollution, and underinvestment in sanitation through judicious use of pricing, regulation, and enforcement mechanisms.

The challenges are immense, but so too are the stakes for economic stability and sustainable development. As we confront cascading global threats from climate change, population growth, urbanization, and environmental degradation - all of which imperil the vital yet vulnerable water ecosystems upon which we depend - achieving SDG 6 is not merely an aspiration, but an existential economic priority for the 21st century global economy. Failure is not an option we can afford.
