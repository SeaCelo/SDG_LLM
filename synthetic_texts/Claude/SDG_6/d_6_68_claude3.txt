Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) from the perspective of Michele Landsberg, a renowned Canadian journalist, author, and social activist:

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 6 - ensuring access to clean water and sanitation for all - is a basic human right and ethical imperative that remains tragically unmet for billions worldwide. As we confront the cascading impacts of climate change, escalating conflicts and mass human displacement, and deeply entrenched gender and economic inequities, our shared human dignity hinges on achieving this fundamental goal.

Water lies at the nexus of public health, poverty alleviation, gender equality, economic opportunity and global stability. Yet an estimated 2.2 billion people lack safely managed drinking water, while 4.2 billion go without adequate sanitation. The impacts reverberate across every facet of sustainable development. Lack of clean water and basic toilets keeps children, especially girls, out of school and traps families in generational cycles of poverty, malnutrition and preventable diseases like cholera, diarrhea, hepatitis and polio.  

Women and girls in the Global South shoulders the cruelest burdens, spending precious hours each day defying threats of sexual violence to collect water from remote, often contaminated sources. This unpaid labor robs them of educational and economic opportunities while jeopardizing their safety. Indigenous peoples' traditional territorialities and water sources are also routinely disregarded and plundered by corporate and state actors for mining, energy and agricultural exploitation without consent or compensation.

Tragically, in our world of breathtaking affluence and technological advances, a child still dies every 90 seconds from preventable water-related diseases. Meanwhile, industrial agriculture consumes 70% of the globe's freshwater while fossil fuel extraction, manufacturing and mining foul and deplete our finite supplies.  

Yet this solvable crisis remains relatively neglected by most wealthy nations and people of privilege. Ignorance, apathy and ideological blinders allow horrific injustice to persist in an age when no government or corporation can credibly claim to be unaware of the moral abomination and existential risks of denying people access to clean water and basic sanitation.

Private profiteers have long regarded basic water provision as a market opportunity ripe for privatization and deregulation. Too often, trade agreements and international lending institutions strong-arm debt-stricken nations into commodifying and selling off their water resources and infrastructure to multinational corporations at ruinous cost to the public good.

The ravages of climate change only compound the urgency, particularly for marginalized communities in the Global South that have contributed least to the crisis. Rising seas, droughts, flooding, and agricultural pressures exacerbate water scarcity and sanitation challenges for the world's poorest. Resource competition also stokes civil unrest, armed conflicts and climate migration - a root driver of the global refugee crisis.

The hard truth is that affluent societies' unsustainable over-consumption jeopardizes our collective future security and human survival. Achieving SDG 6 requires a radical rethinking of our development paradigms toward more equitable models of participatory water resource governance, infrastructure investment, aggressive pollution control, pricing water sustainably, and protecting environmental flows.

Community-led water solutions like rainwater harvesting, gravity-fed drinking systems, farmer-managed soil and water conservation, and indigenous stewardship approaches must be widely scaled and resourced. In urban slums and refugee camps, timely provision of safe sanitation facilities is essential to upholding human dignity and preventing outbreaks.

Wealthy nations must accept greater accountability and responsibility through dramatically increased multilateral funding commitments, debt forgiveness for over-burdened nations, fair and enforceable environmental and human rights standards for corporations - and a fundamental reordering of priorities to elevate water and sanitation toward the apex of our global moral obligations.  

Achieving this goal is not an issue of technological or resource constraints but one of mustering the compassion and political courage to uphold our common humanity. The intolerable injustice of denying 2.2 billion people clean water and 4.2 billion basic sanitation is, in essence, a withering human rights atrocity of our own making. Recognizing water and sanitation rights as an ethical and legal imperative is a prerequisite for safeguarding global public health, gender equity, ecological integrity and human dignity for all.
