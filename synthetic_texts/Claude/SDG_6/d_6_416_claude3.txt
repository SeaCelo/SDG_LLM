The quest to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, as encapsulated in Sustainable Development Goal 6, stands as a monumental challenge that demands unwavering commitment and concerted efforts from nations, organizations, and individuals alike. As a leading authority on aging and older persons, HelpAge International recognizes the intrinsic link between access to clean water and sanitation, and the well-being of older populations â€“ a demographic often overlooked in the discourse surrounding this critical goal.

Through our extensive work in diverse contexts, we have borne witness to the disproportionate burden shouldered by older individuals, particularly in resource-constrained settings, where the lack of access to safe water and adequate sanitation facilities is a harsh reality. The consequences of this deprivation are far-reaching, extending beyond the immediate health implications to encompass broader socioeconomic ramifications.

Older adults, with their heightened vulnerability to water-borne diseases and compromised immune systems, are at an elevated risk of contracting debilitating illnesses when deprived of clean water sources. The physical toll of collecting water from distant locations, often over treacherous terrain, further exacerbates the challenges faced by this demographic, leading to increased fatigue, injury, and diminished quality of life.

The issue of water scarcity and inadequate sanitation extends beyond the realm of physical health, casting a long shadow over the dignity and overall well-being of older persons. In many contexts, the lack of proper sanitation facilities forces individuals to resort to open defecation, a practice that not only poses significant health risks but also compromises personal dignity and safety, particularly for older women who may face heightened vulnerability to violence and exploitation.

Moreover, the ripple effects of inadequate water and sanitation systems reverberate through communities, impacting intergenerational dynamics and exacerbating existing inequalities. Children, particularly girls, are often tasked with the arduous responsibility of fetching water, hampering their educational opportunities and perpetuating cycles of poverty and marginalization.

Recognizing the multifaceted nature of this challenge, HelpAge International advocates for a holistic, age-inclusive approach to achieving SDG 6. We underscore the need to prioritize the specific needs and vulnerabilities of older populations in water and sanitation policies, programs, and interventions, ensuring their active participation and empowerment as agents of change.

Our efforts encompass capacity-building initiatives that empower older individuals to advocate for their rights and participate in decision-making processes regarding water resource management and sanitation infrastructure development. We collaborate with local communities, governments, and stakeholders to promote age-friendly water and sanitation solutions, such as accessible and culturally appropriate facilities, as well as sustainable water harvesting and purification technologies.

Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of integrating age-disaggregated data into monitoring and evaluation frameworks, enabling a nuanced understanding of the challenges faced by different age groups and informing targeted interventions. By amplifying the voices and experiences of older persons, we strive to challenge deep-rooted stigmas and biases that perpetuate their marginalization in development discourse.

Through our extensive partnerships and collaborations, we actively contribute to capacity-building efforts, knowledge-sharing platforms, and advocacy initiatives aimed at fostering inclusive and sustainable water and sanitation systems. We recognize that achieving SDG 6 requires a concerted effort that transcends organizational boundaries, necessitating cross-sectoral collaboration, innovative financing mechanisms, and a shared commitment to leaving no one behind.

As we navigate the complex challenges posed by climate change, urbanization, and population growth, the urgency of addressing water scarcity and inadequate sanitation becomes ever more pressing. HelpAge International remains steadfast in its commitment to ensuring that the rights and needs of older persons are at the forefront of this global endeavor, recognizing that their inclusion is not only a moral imperative but also a cornerstone of sustainable development.
