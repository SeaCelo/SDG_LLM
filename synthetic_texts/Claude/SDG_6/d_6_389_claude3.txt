The global effort to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6), which aims to "ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all," has been a complex and multifaceted endeavor. This analytical report, prepared by the World Health Organization (WHO), aims to provide an in-depth examination of the progress, challenges, and future strategies related to this crucial goal.

Water scarcity and lack of access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation facilities remain critical issues globally, disproportionately affecting developing nations and marginalized communities. Despite substantial progress made in recent decades, billions of people still lack basic access to these essential services, leading to widespread health problems, environmental degradation, and socio-economic implications.

The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated these issues, highlighting the critical importance of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) in preventing the spread of infectious diseases. The pandemic has also exposed the fragility of existing WASH infrastructure and the need for increased resilience in the face of global health emergencies.

In addressing SDG 6, the WHO has adopted a comprehensive approach that encompasses various interconnected aspects, including water resource management, wastewater treatment, hygiene promotion, and capacity building. Collaboration with various stakeholders, including governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and local communities, is essential to achieving sustainable and equitable outcomes.

Water resource management is a critical component of SDG 6, as it involves ensuring the sustainable use and protection of freshwater resources. This includes promoting efficient water usage, reducing water pollution, and implementing integrated water resource management strategies. The WHO has been actively involved in developing guidelines and standards for water quality, as well as providing technical assistance to countries in managing their water resources effectively.

Wastewater treatment is another crucial aspect of SDG 6, as untreated wastewater poses significant risks to public health and the environment. The WHO has been working to promote the adoption of appropriate wastewater treatment technologies, particularly in low-resource settings. This includes advocating for the safe reuse of treated wastewater in agriculture and other sectors, thereby contributing to water conservation and circular economy principles.

Hygiene promotion is a pivotal component of SDG 6, as poor hygiene practices can lead to the transmission of various diseases, particularly in areas with inadequate WASH infrastructure. The WHO has been actively involved in developing and disseminating hygiene education and behavior change programs, with a particular focus on handwashing, menstrual hygiene management, and food safety.

Capacity building is a cross-cutting theme in achieving SDG 6, as it involves strengthening the abilities of governments, institutions, and communities to effectively plan, implement, and sustain WASH interventions. The WHO has been providing technical assistance, training, and knowledge-sharing opportunities to build the necessary human and institutional capacities in various countries.

To address the multifaceted challenges of SDG 6, the WHO has advocated for a comprehensive and integrated approach that recognizes the interconnections between water, sanitation, hygiene, health, and other related sectors. This includes promoting intersectoral collaboration, fostering public-private partnerships, and encouraging the participation of local communities in decision-making processes.
