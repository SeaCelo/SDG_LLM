Here is a detailed, comprehensive response about SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) as an academic article from the perspective of renowned journalist Clarence Page:

Water, Water Everywhere? Think Again. 

By Clarence Page

As a city-bred son of the American Midwest, I confess that I have long taken the availability of clean, running water pretty much for granted. That's easy to do when you've been fortunate enough to live in an area with adequate water infrastructure and resources. But the sad reality for much of the world is dramatically different.

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 6 calls for universal access to safe and affordable drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene by 2030. Those may sound like basic human rights in our modern era, but the numbers tell a sobering tale: The U.N. estimates that currently more than 2 billion people lack safely managed drinking water and over 3.6 billion lack basic sanitation services. The impact is staggering - poor sanitation and contaminated water sources cause diseases that kill hundreds of thousands every year, many of them young children. 

Water insecurity isn't just a public health crisis, it's an economic choke-hold, an environmental threat, and a simmering source of social instability and geopolitical conflict across our planet. Tackling this immense challenge requires urgent global cooperation, investment, and innovation on a massive scale.  

Consider the growing stresses of climate change: Rising temperatures, severe droughts, intensifying storms and flooding imperil water sources for drinking, hygiene, agriculture and industry worldwide. Many major population centers, including potentially 25% of the world's big cities, already face the risk of running out of fresh water. Poorer nations feel the impact first and worst, of course, worsening poverty and hunger in areas lacking infrastructure and resources to conserve and recycle water.

Uneven access also breeds civil unrest and cross-border conflicts. Take the simmering tension across the Middle East where the Jordan, Tigris, and Euphrates river systems flow through multiple countries. As populations grow and water sources dwindle, governments face rising domestic pressures while neighboring states watch suspiciously as waters levels drop across boundaries. The Nile River basin nations and India-Pakistan feuding over their shared rivers offer similar high-stakes scenarios.

Bold multi-national efforts like the U.N'.s Water Action Decade offer pathways to avert worst-case outcomes. The proposed solutions require major investments in wastewater treatment and recycling, sustainable irrigation, infrastructure resilience and conservation programs. New desalination technologies using solar energy could be game-changers, but implementing them widely means developed nations sharing resources with the poorer states predicted to face "water stress" conditions by 2025. Above all, we need binding international agreements, backed by financing and enforcement mechanisms, to manage our planet's precious, finite freshwater basins.

It's a tough path but critics warn the alternative is a future of "water wars" that amplify today's refugee crises, plunging more of humanity into desperation as water becomes more precious than oil across huge swaths of the globe. In this light, the U.N.'s coordinated push for universal clean water and sanitation access looms as one of the world's most vital sustainable development goals for the 21st century.  

Failure risks a catastrophic surrender of hard-earned human progress. The ancient mariner's lament echoes through the centuries with new urgency: "Water, water everywhere, nor any drop to drink." We have the knowledge and resources to avoid that fate, but only if the world's nations finally commit to sharing and preserving our planet's ultimate source of life. There's no long-term shortcut around SDG 6.
