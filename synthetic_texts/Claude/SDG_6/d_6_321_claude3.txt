Expertise France, an esteemed international solidarity agency commissioned by the French government, presents a comprehensive analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6: Clean Water and Sanitation. This goal aims to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, a fundamental human right and a critical enabler for socio-economic development and environmental sustainability.

The global water crisis remains a pressing challenge, with an estimated 2.2 billion people lacking access to safely managed drinking water services, and 4.2 billion lacking access to safely managed sanitation services. This crisis disproportionately affects marginalized communities, exacerbating existing inequalities and perpetuating cycles of poverty. Without access to safe water and sanitation, individuals are vulnerable to waterborne diseases, malnutrition, and compromised education and economic opportunities.

Addressing this crisis requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses infrastructure development, governance reforms, and behavior change interventions. Expertise France has been at the forefront of supporting governments, civil society organizations, and local communities in implementing context-specific solutions.

In the arid regions of Sub-Saharan Africa, Expertise France has championed community-led total sanitation (CLTS) initiatives, empowering communities to construct and maintain their own low-cost sanitation facilities. This approach has proven effective in breaking the cycle of open defecation, reducing the transmission of diseases, and fostering a sense of ownership and pride among community members.

In the urban slums of South Asia, Expertise France has collaborated with local authorities to implement decentralized wastewater treatment systems, utilizing innovative technologies such as constructed wetlands and anaerobic baffled reactors. These systems not only improve sanitation but also facilitate the safe reuse of treated wastewater for agriculture and landscaping, promoting water conservation and circular economy principles.

In the Small Island Developing States (SIDS) of the Caribbean and Pacific, Expertise France has worked to address the unique challenges of water scarcity and vulnerability to climate change. Through capacity-building initiatives and the implementation of rainwater harvesting systems, communities have enhanced their resilience to drought and ensured a reliable supply of potable water.

Recognizing the inextricable link between water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), Expertise France has integrated hygiene education and behavior change communication into its interventions. By engaging with communities and leveraging local influencers, Expertise France has fostered the adoption of proper handwashing practices, menstrual hygiene management, and safe water handling, amplifying the impact of infrastructure investments.

Furthermore, Expertise France has been a strong advocate for gender-responsive WASH programming, acknowledging the disproportionate burden faced by women and girls in accessing water and sanitation services. By involving women in decision-making processes and addressing socio-cultural barriers, Expertise France has contributed to gender equality and female empowerment.

Expertise France's approach is grounded in a comprehensive understanding of the water-energy-food nexus, recognizing the interconnectedness of these vital resources. Through the promotion of sustainable agricultural practices, energy-efficient water supply systems, and integrated resource management, Expertise France has fostered holistic solutions that address multiple SDGs simultaneously.

Collaboration and partnership have been cornerstone principles for Expertise France, recognizing the complex and multidimensional nature of water and sanitation challenges. By engaging with diverse stakeholders, including governments, civil society, private sector, and academia, Expertise France has leveraged collective expertise and resources to drive transformative change.

Looking ahead, Expertise France remains committed to accelerating progress towards SDG 6, acknowledging the urgency of addressing water scarcity, deteriorating water quality, and the impacts of climate change. Through continuous innovation, capacity-building, and knowledge-sharing, Expertise France aims to catalyze sustainable and equitable water and sanitation solutions, ensuring that no one is left behind in the pursuit of this fundamental human right.
