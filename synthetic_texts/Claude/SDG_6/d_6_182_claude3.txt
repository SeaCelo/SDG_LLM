Here is a draft academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), written from the perspective of Leonard Pitts Jr., the renowned American commentator:

Access to safe water is a basic human right, yet billions around the world are denied this elemental necessity. The struggle is one of crushed hopes, broken dreams, and truncated lives. With eyes too often averted, we allow a catastrophic inequity to deepen and metastasize across generations. 

In the burning sands of the Sahara, nomadic tribes trek farther each year, seeking drinkable water as oases evaporate and groundwater depletes. In the teeming capitals of the developing world - Mumbai, Dhaka, Kinshasa - the poor pay ruinous percentages of their meager incomes to water vendors who extort them for a necessity that falls like pennies from heaven upon the privileged. On isolated Pacific islands, rising seas tainted by industrial pollution leave once-pristine atolls uninhabitable. From the valleys of Mexico to the deltas of Vietnam, children stricken by preventable water-borne diseases fight just to survive another day.

The human costs are staggering. Hauling water consumes an estimated 200 million hours of labor each day - a burden that falls disproportionately on women and girls, who are diminished by drudgery rather than empowered with education and economic opportunity. Lack of basic sanitation spreads cholera, dysentery, hepatitis A, and polio to tragic numbers. Some 700 children under the age of five perish every day from diarrheal diseases linked to unsafe water and poor sanitation. In many parts of the world, open defecation is not just an affront to human dignity but a cause of endemic illness.

SDG 6 demands an international commitment to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all by 2030. Meeting that ambitious target requires a massive marshaling of resources and resolve. Aging infrastructure and distribution systems must be modernized and expanded in cities. Sustainable irrigation methods must be incentivized for agriculture while protecting environmental needs. Wastewater treatment facilities are required to recycle gray water and purify effluent. Innovative desalination processes hold promise for quenching thirst in arid climes. All this requires investments measured in the trillions.

But the greater challenge is one of human will. Too often, we avert our gaze from this crisis, preferring to enshroud ourselves in a bubble of privilege that lets us ignore the wrenching truth: No person should be denied that which is the source of life itself. I have been to those places where stained billows mushroom skyward, signaling yet another community depending on "oven makers" who discharge human waste into the streets because sanitary management is unavailable. Let those images singe your conscience and steel your resolve.

Water has stubbornly defied human control - too much in some places, too little in others. But we possess the knowledge and capability to manage this precious resource more equitably and intelligently. What we too often lack is the commitment to do so. That moral indictment extends to us all.

Those with access to safe water must appreciate its priceless value. We must curb the wasteful practices and unchecked pollution of convenience. Most of all, we must see the crisis through the eyes of those who spend half their day in desperate search for something we mindlessly take for granted. 

SDG 6 is not an appeal for charity but a clarion call for justice. It is our calling to transform crisis into sustainable abundance so that no child need fall burning with thirst nor sicken from drinking life's tainted draft. With the future beckoning in a rising tide of mouths to be fed, bodies to be nourished, progress will require us to see the signature human rights issue of this century for what it is - and act with urgency and courage to get clean water to every person on Earth.
