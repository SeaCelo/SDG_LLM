Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) from the perspective of the controversial Australian commentator Andrew Bolt:

The UN's Sustainable Development Goal 6 to "ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all" is just another example of naive global bureaucrats meddling in areas they don't understand. Like so many of the SDGs, it's a well-meaning but misguided utopian fantasy that ignores practical realities.

Let's start with the basic question of water access. The UN tells us that 2.2 billion people lack "safely managed drinking water." But what do they mean by that exactly? Are we talking about pristine bottled water piped directly to every village? Or rainwater collection and bore water access which has sustained traditional communities for centuries? This hair-splitting definitional silliness papers over the huge progress already made over recent decades through economic development and private sector entrepreneurship.  

Globally, around 90% of people now have at least basic drinking water access, up from just 76% in 1990. That's one of the great unreported successes of capitalism and the private sector. Companies like Procter & Gamble and Unilever pioneered affordable household water purification technologies. New drilling rigs and pumps supplied by companies like Grundfos opened up access to groundwater across Africa and Asia. Bottom-up entrepreneurship works – people getting wealthier means they can afford water solutions.

The sanctimonious UN ignores this progress and instead preaches about "human rights" to water and making it essentially free – a total disincentive for investment and maintenance of water infrastructure. It dreams of giant government operations and utilities to pour more concrete and build dams and treatment plants. But these centralized, unaccountable bureaucracies are a major reason clean water remains so scarce – with an estimated 30-40% of water supplies lost to leakage, corruption and mismanagement.

Think of all the pipe networks crumbling from lack of upkeep. Or the water treatment plants left to decay because broke governments can't cover operating costs. This is the reality of top-down, "sustainable" planning by philanthropists and social engineers who've never had to actually make a system work.

The UN also bangs on endlessly about poor "sanitation access." But here they are just offensive cultural imperialists. What gives them the right to deem traditional toilet and waste systems around the world as unacceptable? Many communities have harmoniously cycled human wastes back into agriculture for thousands of years. It's only modern sensibilities about hygiene that now judge such practices as backward or unhygienic.

Of course, better sanitation has helped reduce disease and child mortality historically – real human progress. But not everyone wants to be shackled to Big Sewage and pay perpetually for centralized treatment plants. Sometimes pit latrines or composting toilets are a more sustainable solution. Give people economic freedom and they'll work it out.

That's real sustainability: not UN diktats, but free individuals weighing their own needs and finding affordable water and sanitation solutions through capitalism and markets. More economic liberty, not eco-utopian centralized planning, is what has demonstrably raised living standards. The UN should butt out and let the magic of the private sector work its wonders.
