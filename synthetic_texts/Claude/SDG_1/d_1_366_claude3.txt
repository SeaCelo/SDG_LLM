The fight against poverty in all its forms remains one of the greatest challenges facing the global community as we strive towards the ambitious targets set forth by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1) – "No Poverty" – serves as a poignant reminder that our collective progress is inextricably linked to our ability to eradicate this multidimensional scourge.

In our region, the impact of poverty extends far beyond mere economic deprivation, casting a long shadow over the realization of fundamental human rights and hindering the social, political, and economic development of our nations. Poverty is both a cause and a consequence of multiple intersecting factors, including inadequate access to quality education, healthcare, and basic services, as well as limited economic opportunities, environmental degradation, and persistent inequalities.

Despite notable progress in recent decades, the COVID-19 pandemic has served as a harsh reminder of the fragility of our gains and the enduring resilience of poverty. The crisis has exacerbated existing vulnerabilities, underscoring the urgent need for comprehensive, coordinated, and transformative action to address the root causes of poverty and promote inclusive, sustainable development.

At the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), we recognize that achieving SDG 1 requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the complex interplay of economic, social, and environmental factors. Our strategy is grounded in a deep understanding of the region's unique challenges and opportunities, informed by rigorous analysis and evidence-based policymaking.

One of our key priorities is fostering inclusive economic growth and promoting decent work opportunities for all. We are committed to supporting policy frameworks that incentivize private sector investment, foster entrepreneurship, and promote sustainable job creation, with a particular focus on empowering marginalized communities and vulnerable groups, such as women, youth, and indigenous populations.

Complementing our efforts in the economic sphere, we are actively investing in human capital development through targeted interventions in education, healthcare, and social protection systems. Our initiatives aim to break the intergenerational cycle of poverty by ensuring equitable access to quality services and empowering individuals with the skills and knowledge necessary to thrive in a rapidly evolving global economy.

Moreover, we recognize the inextricable link between poverty and environmental degradation, and are actively supporting sustainable natural resource management, climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, and the transition towards a low-carbon, resource-efficient economy. By promoting sustainable development pathways, we aim to safeguard the environmental assets upon which our communities depend, while creating new economic opportunities and enhancing resilience to shocks and stresses.

Underpinning our efforts is a strong commitment to fostering inclusive governance and enhancing the capacity of our partner countries to design and implement evidence-based policies. We are actively engaging with governments, civil society organizations, and the private sector to promote transparency, accountability, and citizen participation, ensuring that development strategies are responsive to local needs and priorities.

As we look towards the future, we are cognizant of the immense challenges that lie ahead, but remain steadfast in our determination to eradicate poverty in all its forms. By leveraging our collective expertise, resources, and partnerships, we are confident in our ability to catalyze transformative change and forge a path towards a more prosperous, equitable, and sustainable future for the peoples of the Americas.
