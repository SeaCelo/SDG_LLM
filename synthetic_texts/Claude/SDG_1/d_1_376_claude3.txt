The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) presents this analytical report on the progress and challenges associated with Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1): End poverty in all its forms everywhere. Poverty remains a pervasive global issue, with multidimensional implications that extend beyond mere monetary deprivation. Despite concerted efforts, the world is not on track to achieve SDG 1 by the 2030 target, necessitating a critical examination of existing strategies and a renewed commitment to innovative solutions.

Poverty eradication is a complex endeavor that requires a holistic approach, addressing not only income poverty but also non-income dimensions such as access to basic services, healthcare, education, and social protection. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing inequalities, reversing decades of progress and pushing an additional 119 to 124 million people into extreme poverty in 2020. Furthermore, the ongoing conflicts, climate change, and economic shocks have compounded the challenges, underscoring the need for resilient and adaptive poverty reduction strategies.

While progress has been made in reducing extreme poverty, with the global rate declining from 36% in 1990 to 9.2% in 2017, significant disparities persist across and within countries. Sub-Saharan Africa and fragile and conflict-affected regions continue to grapple with disproportionately high poverty rates, highlighting the need for targeted interventions tailored to local contexts. Moreover, the rural-urban divide persists, with rural areas experiencing higher levels of poverty due to limited access to economic opportunities, infrastructure, and services.

Addressing poverty requires a multi-faceted approach that encompasses social protection systems, inclusive economic growth, human capital development, and resilience building. Social protection programs, such as cash transfers, have proven effective in mitigating the immediate impacts of poverty, while investments in education, healthcare, and infrastructure foster long-term poverty reduction by enhancing human capital and enabling economic participation.

Furthermore, inclusive and sustainable economic growth that generates decent employment opportunities and promotes equitable distribution of resources is crucial for reducing poverty. This necessitates policies that support entrepreneurship, access to finance, and the formalization of informal sectors, particularly in developing economies where a significant portion of the workforce operates in the informal sector.

Climate change and environmental degradation pose significant threats to poverty eradication efforts, disproportionately impacting the most vulnerable populations. Adaptation and mitigation strategies that promote sustainable livelihoods, climate-resilient infrastructure, and ecosystem preservation are essential for building resilience and reducing the poverty-environment nexus.

Effective implementation of SDG 1 requires a collaborative effort involving governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector. Strengthening institutional capacities, promoting good governance, and fostering partnerships are critical for coordinating efforts, mobilizing resources, and ensuring accountability.

In conclusion, while progress has been made, eradicating poverty in all its forms remains a formidable challenge that demands sustained commitment, innovative approaches, and a comprehensive strategy that addresses the multidimensional nature of poverty. By prioritizing inclusive economic growth, social protection, human capital development, resilience building, and environmental sustainability, the global community can make significant strides towards achieving SDG 1 and ensuring a more equitable and prosperous future for all.
