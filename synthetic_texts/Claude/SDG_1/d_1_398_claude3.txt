All We Can, a renowned Methodist relief and development organization, presents this incisive analytical report on the current state of Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1): No Poverty. Drawing upon our extensive field experience and rigorous research, we offer a comprehensive assessment of the global efforts to eradicate poverty in all its forms and dimensions.

SDG 1 serves as a foundational pillar for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, recognizing that poverty is not merely a lack of income but a multidimensional phenomenon encompassing deprivations in access to healthcare, education, clean water, sanitation, and other essential services. Despite the remarkable progress achieved over the past decades, with the global extreme poverty rate declining from 36% in 1990 to 9.2% in 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing vulnerabilities, reversing years of hard-won gains.

The pandemic's socioeconomic ramifications have been particularly severe for low-income countries, where fragile healthcare systems, limited fiscal space, and reliance on informal employment have amplified the impact of lockdowns and economic disruptions. According to World Bank estimates, the pandemic pushed an additional 119 to 124 million people into extreme poverty in 2020, with the total number of people living on less than $1.90 per day rising to 711 million.

While the global community has made commendable efforts to mitigate the immediate impacts through social protection programs and emergency relief measures, these interventions often fall short of addressing the structural drivers of poverty. Persistent inequalities, limited access to productive resources, and inadequate investment in human capital continue to perpetuate intergenerational cycles of poverty, particularly in rural areas and among marginalized groups.

Our on-the-ground experience in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia has revealed the stark realities faced by communities mired in chronic poverty. In rural regions, smallholder farmers grapple with climate-related shocks, poor infrastructure, and limited access to markets, trapping them in subsistence farming and hampering their ability to accumulate assets or invest in their children's education. In urban slums, informal workers face precarious employment conditions, lack of social safety nets, and inadequate access to basic services, perpetuating a vicious cycle of vulnerability.

To achieve SDG 1, a holistic and transformative approach is required, one that addresses the root causes of poverty and promotes inclusive economic growth. Innovative financing mechanisms, such as blended finance and impact investing, can catalyze private sector engagement and mobilize resources towards sustainable development initiatives. However, these efforts must be complemented by robust national policies that prioritize equitable access to quality education, healthcare, and productive resources, particularly for marginalized communities.

Furthermore, climate change poses an existential threat to poverty eradication efforts, as extreme weather events and environmental degradation disproportionately impact the most vulnerable populations. Integrating climate resilience into development strategies and promoting sustainable natural resource management are crucial for safeguarding hard-won gains and ensuring long-term progress towards SDG 1.

In conclusion, while the global community has made significant strides in reducing poverty, the COVID-19 pandemic has served as a stark reminder of the fragility of these achievements and the urgency of addressing the multidimensional nature of poverty. Achieving SDG 1 will require a concerted effort, involving strategic partnerships, innovative financing mechanisms, and a unwavering commitment to promoting inclusive, resilient, and sustainable development pathways. Only through a holistic and transformative approach can we truly eradicate poverty in all its forms and dimensions, paving the way for a more equitable and prosperous world for all.
