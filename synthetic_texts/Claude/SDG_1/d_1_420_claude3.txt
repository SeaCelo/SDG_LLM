International Development Enterprises (IDE) presents this analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1) â€“ "End poverty in all its forms everywhere." Poverty remains a profound and multidimensional challenge, deeply intertwined with issues of inequality, social exclusion, and lack of access to resources and opportunities. Despite significant progress in recent decades, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing vulnerabilities, pushing millions into extreme poverty and reversing hard-won gains.

While the global extreme poverty rate has declined from 36% in 1990 to 8.6% in 2018, the pandemic's impact has been severe, with an estimated 97 million more people falling into extreme poverty in 2020 alone. This setback underscores the need for a comprehensive and coordinated approach to address the multifaceted drivers of poverty.

One of the key challenges in eradicating poverty is the persistent inequality within and between countries. Income inequality remains high, with the richest 10% of the global population earning 40% of total global income. This disparity is further exacerbated by unequal access to resources, education, healthcare, and economic opportunities, creating a vicious cycle that perpetuates poverty across generations.

Moreover, poverty disproportionately affects specific groups, including women, children, persons with disabilities, and marginalized communities. These vulnerable populations often face systemic barriers, discrimination, and limited access to social protection systems, trapping them in cycles of deprivation and exclusion.

Addressing poverty requires a multidimensional approach that tackles its root causes and creates enabling environments for sustainable livelihoods. This involves investing in inclusive and equitable economic growth, promoting decent work and productive employment opportunities, strengthening social protection systems, and ensuring access to quality education, healthcare, and basic services.

Furthermore, combating poverty necessitates addressing the intersections with other SDGs, such as gender equality (SDG 5), reduced inequalities (SDG 10), and climate action (SDG 13). Poverty is often exacerbated by environmental degradation, natural disasters, and the impacts of climate change, which disproportionately affect the most vulnerable populations. Conversely, sustainable management of natural resources and resilient infrastructure can unlock economic opportunities and enhance the livelihoods of the poor.

Effective poverty eradication requires strong partnerships and collaborative efforts among governments, civil society organizations, the private sector, and international development agencies. These partnerships should prioritize localized solutions, community empowerment, and the meaningful participation of those living in poverty in decision-making processes.

IDE's approach to poverty eradication involves leveraging market-based solutions and promoting inclusive entrepreneurship. By providing access to affordable technologies, training, and financial services, IDE empowers smallholder farmers and micro-entrepreneurs to improve their productivity, increase their incomes, and build resilient livelihoods. This approach not only addresses poverty but also contributes to sustainable agriculture (SDG 2), decent work and economic growth (SDG 8), and responsible consumption and production (SDG 12).

In conclusion, eradicating poverty in all its forms is a complex and multidimensional challenge that requires a concerted and coordinated effort from all stakeholders. By addressing the root causes of poverty, promoting inclusive economic growth, strengthening social protection systems, and fostering sustainable livelihoods, we can make significant strides towards achieving SDG 1 and creating a more equitable and prosperous world for all.
