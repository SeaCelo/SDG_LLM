Eradicating poverty in all its forms remains one of the greatest challenges we face as a global community. As the Director of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Regional Hub for Latin America and the Caribbean, I have witnessed firsthand the multidimensional nature of poverty and the complex interplay between its various drivers and manifestations.

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, with its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), provides a comprehensive blueprint for addressing the root causes of poverty while promoting inclusive economic growth, social development, and environmental sustainability. SDG 1, which aims to "end poverty in all its forms everywhere," is a fundamental prerequisite for achieving the other SDGs and realizing the vision of a more just, equitable, and prosperous world.

Poverty is not merely a lack of income; it is a deprivation of basic human rights, including access to education, healthcare, clean water, sanitation, and decent work opportunities. It is a multidimensional phenomenon that perpetuates intergenerational cycles of marginalization, vulnerability, and disempowerment. In Latin America and the Caribbean, despite significant progress in reducing poverty rates over the past decades, persistent inequalities, structural barriers, and the impacts of climate change continue to impede our efforts to eradicate poverty in all its forms.

Addressing poverty requires a holistic and integrated approach that tackles its underlying causes and recognizes the interconnectedness of the SDGs. Poverty alleviation strategies must be tailored to the specific contexts and needs of vulnerable populations, including women, children, indigenous communities, and marginalized groups. Building resilient and inclusive social protection systems, promoting decent work and economic opportunities, and investing in human capital through quality education and healthcare are critical components of this endeavor.

Moreover, we must acknowledge the disproportionate impact of poverty on women and girls, who often face multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and marginalization. Empowering women and girls through targeted interventions, addressing gender-based violence, and promoting equal opportunities in education, employment, and decision-making processes is not only a moral imperative but also a catalyst for sustainable development and poverty reduction.

Addressing poverty also requires a concerted effort to address the environmental dimensions of sustainable development. Climate change, biodiversity loss, and environmental degradation exacerbate poverty by undermining livelihoods, food security, and access to natural resources. Integrating environmental sustainability into poverty alleviation strategies, promoting sustainable agriculture and natural resource management, and investing in resilient infrastructure and renewable energy solutions are crucial for ensuring that our efforts are not undermined by the adverse impacts of environmental degradation.

Partnerships and international cooperation are essential for mobilizing the resources, knowledge, and collective action necessary to achieve SDG 1. The UNDP, in collaboration with national governments, civil society organizations, private sector partners, and other stakeholders, plays a pivotal role in catalyzing progress towards poverty eradication. Through our multi-country Sustainable Development Cooperation Frameworks, we support countries in developing and implementing comprehensive poverty reduction strategies, promoting inclusive economic growth, and building resilient and sustainable communities.

Additionally, we must harness the power of innovation and technology to accelerate progress towards SDG 1. Digital solutions, such as mobile money platforms, can facilitate financial inclusion and access to essential services for marginalized populations. Data-driven approaches, including the use of geospatial data and predictive analytics, can help target interventions more effectively and monitor progress towards poverty reduction targets.

Ultimately, eradicating poverty in all its forms requires a transformative shift in our development paradigms, challenging traditional power structures and addressing the root causes of inequality and marginalization. It demands a commitment to leaving no one behind, ensuring that even the most vulnerable and marginalized individuals and communities have access to opportunities and resources to build a dignified and prosperous life.

As we approach the decade of action for the SDGs, it is imperative that we redouble our efforts to achieve SDG 1. Poverty is not
