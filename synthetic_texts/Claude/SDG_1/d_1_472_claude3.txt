Eradicating Extreme Poverty: The Greatest Opportunity of Our Time

By the Fortune Editorial Board

For business leaders around the world, the fight against extreme poverty should be viewed as one of the greatest opportunities of the 21st century. The World Bank defines extreme poverty as living on less than $1.90 per day, and an estimated 736 million people globally are trapped in these dehumanizing conditions. However, ending extreme poverty is not only a moral imperative, it's also a tremendous economic opportunity that could unleash trillions in potential consumer spending and productive human capital.

Goal 1 of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals calls for an end to poverty in all its forms everywhere by 2030. This is an ambitious yet achievable target that would deliver immense dividends for the private sector. Just consider the staggering impacts: According to research, eliminating extreme poverty could grow the global GDP by up to 6% and create new consumer markets worth trillions annually. Poverty perpetuates a vicious cycle of poor health, lack of education, diminished productivity, and economic stagnation. Breaking this cycle unlocks doors to prosperity.

Innovative businesses are already making inroads by developing new products, services, and business models tailored to serve the bottom billion. For example, mobile money platforms like M-Pesa have empowered the unbanked poor with access to financial services via basic cellphones. Affordable smart farming technologies are optimizing yields for smallholder farmers. Low-cost off-grid solar systems provide clean, inexpensive energy to remote communities previously trapped in energy poverty. And impact investment funds are channeling billions into poverty reduction efforts, generating solid returns while driving sustainable economic development.

Of course, the private sector cannot solve poverty alone. Robust public-private partnerships that combine corporate resources with government policies and civil society expertise are integral to this fight. Businesses also must ensure their supply chains uplift rather than exploit impoverished communities. Perhaps most critically, successful poverty alleviation hinges on empowering the poor as consumers and entrepreneurs, not treating them as mere recipients of aid.

Extreme poverty is the greatest market failure the world has ever faced. By prioritizing poverty eradication through SDG 1, we can correct this failure, add billions of productive participants to the global economy, and generate sustainable business growth for decades to come. The cost of inaction is far too high â€“ it's time for the private sector to lead the charge in ending extreme poverty once and for all.
