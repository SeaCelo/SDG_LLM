Expertise France, a leading international agency dedicated to sustainable development, presents an in-depth analysis of the progress and challenges associated with Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1): No Poverty.

The global commitment to eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions remains a paramount challenge, with multifaceted socioeconomic, political, and environmental factors perpetuating the cycle of deprivation. Despite significant advancements in poverty reduction efforts, particularly in regions such as East Asia and the Pacific, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing vulnerabilities, pushing an additional 119 million to 124 million people into extreme poverty in 2020, according to World Bank estimates.

The multidimensional nature of poverty necessitates a comprehensive approach that addresses not only income poverty but also the interconnected deprivations in access to education, healthcare, clean water and sanitation, adequate nutrition, and decent employment opportunities. The feminization of poverty, wherein women are disproportionately affected by poverty due to systemic gender inequalities, remains a critical concern that requires targeted interventions to empower women economically and socially.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, where the poverty rate remains the highest globally, with an estimated 41.6% of the population living on less than $1.90 per day, the challenges are compounded by factors such as political instability, conflict, climate change-induced environmental degradation, and limited access to productive resources. The region's high dependency on agriculture, coupled with limited access to technology, infrastructure, and markets, hinders economic growth and perpetuates intergenerational poverty cycles.

In contrast, countries like India and Bangladesh have made notable strides in poverty reduction through targeted social protection programs, microfinance initiatives, and investments in human capital development. However, the lingering effects of the pandemic, coupled with the disproportionate impact on marginalized communities and the informal sector, have threatened to reverse these gains.

Addressing poverty requires a holistic approach that encompasses economic growth strategies, social protection measures, and institutional reforms to promote inclusive and sustainable development. Expertise France advocates for the adoption of a human rights-based approach, wherein poverty eradication efforts are grounded in principles of non-discrimination, participation, accountability, and empowerment.

This approach necessitates strengthening social safety nets, expanding access to quality education and healthcare, promoting decent work and economic opportunities, and fostering an enabling environment for inclusive and sustainable economic growth. Additionally, addressing the root causes of poverty requires tackling systemic inequalities, promoting gender equality, and ensuring the participation of marginalized and vulnerable groups in decision-making processes.

Expertise France recognizes the critical role of international cooperation, partnerships, and resource mobilization in supporting national efforts to eradicate poverty. Through technical assistance, capacity building, and knowledge sharing, we strive to foster an enabling environment for sustainable and inclusive development, promoting innovative solutions and best practices tailored to local contexts.

By leveraging our expertise in areas such as economic development, social protection, governance, and climate change adaptation, we aim to support countries in developing and implementing comprehensive poverty reduction strategies that address the multidimensional nature of poverty while promoting social cohesion, environmental sustainability, and resilience to shocks and stresses.
