Eradicating poverty in all its forms remains one of the greatest challenges facing the global community, and a core mission for Catholic Relief Services (CRS). Despite significant progress in reducing extreme poverty over the past decades, the COVID-19 pandemic has undone years of hard-won gains, pushing an estimated 120 million additional people into poverty in 2020 alone. 

As a faith-based organization committed to upholding human dignity and promoting integral human development, CRS recognizes that poverty is a multidimensional phenomenon that goes beyond mere income deprivation. It encompasses a range of interrelated factors, including lack of access to quality education, healthcare, clean water and sanitation, adequate nutrition, and decent employment opportunities. Poverty is both a cause and consequence of marginalization, social exclusion, and disempowerment, often disproportionately affecting women, children, and other vulnerable groups.

In line with the Catholic social teaching principles of solidarity, subsidiarity, and the preferential option for the poor, CRS adopts a holistic and community-driven approach to poverty alleviation. Our interventions are guided by a deep understanding of local contexts, rooted in partnerships with local communities, civil society organizations, and government institutions.

One of our flagship programs is the Graduation Approach, which combines asset transfers, cash stipends, skills training, and mentorship to help ultra-poor households build sustainable livelihoods and resilience. This evidence-based model has proven highly effective in breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty, empowering participants to diversify their income sources, accumulate productive assets, and enhance their social capital.

In the wake of the pandemic, CRS has also scaled up its efforts to address the immediate needs of those most affected by the economic fallout. Our emergency response initiatives, such as cash transfers and food assistance, have provided vital support to vulnerable households, helping them cope with income shocks and safeguarding their basic needs.

Recognizing the inextricable link between poverty and environmental degradation, CRS has integrated climate-smart agriculture and natural resource management into its programming. By promoting sustainable farming practices, water conservation techniques, and ecosystem restoration, we aim to enhance the resilience of smallholder farmers and pastoralists, many of whom are disproportionately affected by the impacts of climate change.

Furthermore, CRS places a strong emphasis on empowering women and promoting gender equality, as we understand that achieving SDG 1 is intrinsically tied to addressing entrenched gender inequalities and sociocultural norms that perpetuate poverty and marginalization. Our initiatives focus on enhancing women's economic empowerment, leadership opportunities, and decision-making roles within households and communities.

While progress has been made, the COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly set back global efforts to end poverty. As we navigate the aftermath of this crisis, CRS remains committed to working in solidarity with the poor and marginalized, leveraging our faith-based values, technical expertise, and partnerships to promote inclusive and sustainable development that leaves no one behind.
