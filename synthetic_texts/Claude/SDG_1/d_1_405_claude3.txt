The pursuit of eradicating poverty in all its forms has been a long-standing global endeavor, and the Center for Victims of Torture (CVT) recognizes the inextricable link between poverty and the prevalence of torture and human rights violations. Poverty acts as a catalyst for conflict, exploitation, and the erosion of human dignity, creating conditions ripe for the perpetration of torture and other forms of violence.

In examining the current state of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1, which aims to "end poverty in all its forms everywhere," it is crucial to understand the multidimensional nature of poverty and its profound impact on the vulnerable populations that CVT serves. Poverty transcends mere economic deprivation; it is a complex phenomenon that encompasses social, political, and cultural dimensions, perpetuating cycles of marginalization, disempowerment, and human rights abuses.

The analysis of SDG 1 must be grounded in the recognition that poverty is both a cause and a consequence of torture and trauma. Individuals and communities living in extreme poverty are often targeted for torture due to their perceived lack of power and voice, rendering them susceptible to exploitation and abuse by state and non-state actors alike. Conversely, the trauma inflicted by torture can have devastating economic consequences, hindering survivors' ability to secure employment, access education, and maintain stable livelihoods, thereby perpetuating the cycle of poverty.

In addressing SDG 1, CVT acknowledges the intersectionality of poverty with other forms of oppression, such as gender-based violence, displacement, and conflict. Women and girls, who disproportionately bear the burden of poverty, are particularly vulnerable to torture and exploitation, with poverty acting as a barrier to their empowerment and access to justice. Similarly, refugees and internally displaced persons, whose lives have been upended by conflict and violence, often find themselves trapped in cycles of poverty and marginalization, increasing their susceptibility to further trauma and human rights violations.

CVT's approach to SDG 1 must be multifaceted, addressing not only the economic dimensions of poverty but also its root causes and consequences. This requires a holistic strategy that integrates trauma-informed interventions with efforts to promote sustainable livelihoods, access to education, and the empowerment of marginalized communities.

One crucial aspect of CVT's work in this regard is the provision of comprehensive rehabilitation services for torture survivors, recognizing the intrinsic link between healing and economic empowerment. By addressing the psychological, physical, and social impacts of torture, CVT's interventions aim to create a foundation for survivors to rebuild their lives, regain their agency, and break free from the cycles of poverty and oppression.

Additionally, CVT's advocacy efforts play a pivotal role in addressing the systemic factors that perpetuate poverty and enable torture. Through strategic partnerships, policy engagement, and capacity-building initiatives, CVT works to promote sustainable development, strengthen human rights protections, and foster inclusive societies where the rights and dignity of all individuals are upheld.

In conclusion, the Center for Victims of Torture's approach to SDG 1 recognizes the complex interplay between poverty, torture, and human rights violations. By addressing the multidimensional aspects of poverty and its underlying causes, CVT seeks to create an enabling environment for the realization of human rights, the promotion of sustainable livelihoods, and the empowerment of marginalized communities. Only through a comprehensive and integrated approach can we truly end poverty in all its forms and build a world where torture and human rights abuses are eradicated.
