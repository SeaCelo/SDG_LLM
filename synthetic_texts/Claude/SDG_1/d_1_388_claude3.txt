As the World Food Programme, our mission is to eradicate global hunger and promote sustainable food security and nutrition. SDG 1, "No Poverty," is intrinsically linked to our efforts, as poverty is both a cause and consequence of hunger and malnutrition.

Poverty remains a pervasive challenge, with approximately 689 million people living in extreme poverty as of 2017, surviving on less than $1.90 per day. This deprivation perpetuates a vicious cycle, as the impoverished lack access to nutritious food, clean water, and essential services like healthcare and education. Consequently, malnutrition impairs physical and cognitive development, hindering individuals' ability to escape poverty through employment or entrepreneurship.

Addressing SDG 1 requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses social protection systems, inclusive economic growth policies, and investment in human capital. Social safety nets, such as cash transfers, food vouchers, and school feeding programs, provide immediate relief while empowering families to invest in their future. However, these initiatives must be complemented by sustainable livelihood opportunities that foster long-term resilience.

Inclusive economic growth strategies that prioritize decent job creation, entrepreneurship support, and equitable access to resources are crucial for poverty alleviation. For instance, our Purchase for Progress (P4P) initiative connects smallholder farmers to markets, enabling them to increase their incomes and food security. Additionally, investing in human capital through quality education, vocational training, and healthcare enhances productivity and earning potential, breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty.

Climate change and environmental degradation exacerbate poverty, particularly in regions dependent on agriculture and natural resources. Initiatives that promote sustainable land management, resilient agricultural practices, and ecosystem restoration are vital for safeguarding livelihoods and food security in vulnerable communities.

Achieving SDG 1 is inextricably linked to progress on other SDGs, such as Zero Hunger (SDG 2), Good Health and Well-being (SDG 3), Quality Education (SDG 4), and Climate Action (SDG 13). For instance, our school feeding programs not only alleviate hunger but also incentivize education, empowering future generations to break the poverty cycle. Furthermore, improving access to healthcare and nutrition services enhances productivity and economic potential.

To accelerate progress towards SDG 1, we must foster multi-stakeholder partnerships that leverage the expertise and resources of governments, civil society organizations, the private sector, and local communities. Collaborative efforts that integrate social protection, sustainable livelihoods, climate resilience, and human capital development are essential for creating a world free from poverty and hunger.

In conclusion, eradicating poverty requires a holistic and sustainable approach that addresses the root causes and multidimensional nature of this global challenge. By promoting inclusive economic growth, investing in human capital, and fostering resilience to environmental shocks, we can empower individuals and communities to break the vicious cycle of poverty and hunger, ushering in a more equitable and prosperous future for all.
