The World Health Organization (WHO) continues to prioritize the eradication of poverty in all its forms as a fundamental aspect of improving global health outcomes and fostering sustainable development. Substantial progress has been made in recent decades, with the global rate of extreme poverty declining from 36% in 1990 to 8.6% in 2018. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has reversed many of these gains, pushing an additional 119 to 124 million people into extreme poverty in 2020.

Poverty remains inextricably linked to poor health, acting as both a cause and consequence. Those living in poverty face increased exposure to environmental hazards, lack of access to quality healthcare and education, higher rates of malnutrition, and a greater risk of contracting communicable diseases. Conversely, ill health can rapidly deplete household resources, perpetuating the cycle of poverty through catastrophic out-of-pocket expenditures and reduced productivity.

The WHO recognizes that a multidimensional approach is essential to address the complex interplay between poverty and health. Initiatives such as the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework aim to enhance equitable access to life-saving vaccines and treatments during public health emergencies, mitigating the disproportionate impact on impoverished communities. Furthermore, the organization actively collaborates with member states to strengthen universal health coverage (UHC) systems, ensuring that essential health services are accessible and affordable for all, regardless of socioeconomic status.

Innovative financing mechanisms, such as the Global Financing Facility (GFF), play a crucial role in mobilizing resources and coordinating efforts across sectors to tackle the root causes of poverty. By leveraging domestic resources and catalyzing external investments, the GFF supports countries in establishing sustainable and resilient health systems, ultimately fostering economic growth and poverty reduction.

Empowering communities through health education and capacity-building initiatives is also a key strategy. The WHO's Healthy Settings approach, for instance, promotes healthy behaviors and environments in schools, workplaces, and municipalities, addressing social determinants of health and enabling individuals to break free from the intergenerational cycle of poverty.

It is crucial to acknowledge that the goal of eradicating poverty is intrinsically linked to other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Progress in areas such as quality education (SDG 4), decent work and economic growth (SDG 8), reduced inequalities (SDG 10), and climate action (SDG 13) directly impacts poverty alleviation efforts. Conversely, addressing poverty is a prerequisite for achieving many other SDGs, as it underpins improved health outcomes, access to education, and overall societal well-being.

In conclusion, the WHO's efforts to combat poverty and promote global health are grounded in a comprehensive, multisectoral approach that recognizes the interconnected nature of the SDGs. By fostering cross-sectoral collaboration, mobilizing resources, and empowering communities, the organization remains steadfast in its commitment to creating a world where no one is left behind, ensuring that every individual has access to the fundamental human right of good health and well-being.
