Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 1 (No Poverty), written from the perspective of Dennis Prager:

The fight against poverty is one of the great moral causes of our time. Allowing our fellow human beings to languish in abject deprivation is an affront to human dignity and a violation of our core Judeo-Christian values. As a society, we have a solemn obligation to uplift the poor and afford them the opportunity to achieve self-sufficiency through hard work and personal responsibility.

From a pragmatic standpoint, entrenched poverty breeds instability, crime, and a host of other societal ills. It is in our collective interest as a nation to ensure that all citizens have a fair shot at economic prosperity. However, our motivation must be rooted primarily in ethics, not mere self-interest. We are our brother's keeper, called upon by G-d to serve the neediest among us.   

The free market capitalist system, which has lifted billions out of poverty globally, remains the greatest weapon in this fight. Through entrepreneurship, innovation, and the pursuit of productive capitalism, we create the rising tide that lifts all boats. However, the market alone is insufficient - we must pair it with a robust social safety net that provides a hand up, not a permanent hand-out.  

To that end, I would advocate a multi-pronged approach centered on promoting human flourishing. Job training, vocational education, and accessible micro-financing will empower the poor to achieve self-reliance. Meanwhile, targeted welfare programs - structured as temporary support with defined exit ramps - can help families get back on their feet during hard times. A key focus must be on keeping families intact, as fatherless households are the surest predictor of cyclical poverty.

We must also address the moral-spiritual void that enables poverty to persist. A lack of Judeo-Christian values such as hard work, delayed gratification, and personal accountability is generationally perpetuating this crisis. Religious institutions and community organizations have a vital role in modeling ethical behavior and instilling a sense of purpose.  

Ultimately, conquering poverty demands a synthesis of free market economics, a robust safety net, and a reawakening of our nation's moral compass. Only then can we live up to our ideals as a shining city upon a hill - a force for human dignity, prosperity, and G-d's creation flourishing.  

No challenge is too large when we remain steadfast in our commitments and unwavering in our values. I am confident that this righteous struggle can unite Americans across the ideological spectrum. Let us lock arms and renew our vow: to form a more perfect union, establish justice, and ensure the blessings of liberty for all.
