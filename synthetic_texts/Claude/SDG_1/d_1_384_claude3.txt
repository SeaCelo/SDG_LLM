The global commitment to eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, enshrined in Sustainable Development Goal 1, represents a moral imperative and a crucial step towards realizing a more equitable and prosperous world. However, as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, I am acutely aware of the inextricable link between poverty and forced displacement, which poses a formidable challenge to achieving this noble goal.

Poverty is both a cause and a consequence of displacement, creating a vicious cycle that perpetuates vulnerability and marginalization. Conflict, violence, and persecution, often driven by resource scarcity, inequality, and lack of economic opportunities, force millions of people to flee their homes annually, leaving behind their livelihoods and assets. This sudden loss of income and resources, coupled with the trauma of displacement, plunges many into destitution, making them susceptible to exploitation, human trafficking, and other forms of abuse.

Moreover, the conditions in which refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) find themselves exacerbate their poverty. Overcrowded camps and informal settlements frequently lack basic services, such as clean water, sanitation, and healthcare, creating breeding grounds for disease and malnutrition. Limited access to education and livelihood opportunities further entrenches the cycle of poverty, diminishing the prospects for self-reliance and sustainable integration.

It is noteworthy that the majority of the world's displaced population resides in developing countries, often in regions already grappling with high levels of poverty and limited resources. This influx of vulnerable people strains the host communities' ability to provide adequate support, leading to increased competition for scarce resources, potential social tensions, and a deterioration in living standards for both displaced and host populations.

Addressing poverty among the forcibly displaced requires a multifaceted approach that acknowledges the complex interplay between displacement, conflict, and development. Firstly, we must prioritize conflict prevention and resolution, as ongoing violence and instability perpetuate displacement and undermine efforts to build sustainable livelihoods. This necessitates concerted diplomatic efforts, peacebuilding initiatives, and addressing the root causes of conflict, such as inequality, human rights violations, and resource scarcity.

Secondly, we must enhance the resilience and self-reliance of displaced populations by investing in their human capital and creating enabling environments for sustainable livelihoods. This includes ensuring access to quality education, vocational training, and entrepreneurship opportunities, as well as fostering an inclusive policy environment that allows refugees and IDPs to participate in the formal labor market and contribute to the local economy.

Thirdly, we must strengthen the capacity of host communities and national systems to absorb and support displaced populations. This entails investing in infrastructure, basic services, and social protection mechanisms, while promoting inclusive policies that foster social cohesion and prevent marginalization.

Furthermore, we must leverage the potential of innovative financing mechanisms, such as impact investing, blended finance, and public-private partnerships, to mobilize resources and catalyze sustainable development initiatives that benefit both displaced and host communities.

It is imperative to recognize that the forcibly displaced are not mere recipients of aid but active agents of change, possessing valuable skills, knowledge, and resilience. By empowering them to participate in decision-making processes and harnessing their potential, we can foster inclusive and sustainable development solutions that benefit all.

Ultimately, eradicating poverty among the forcibly displaced is not only a moral obligation but also a strategic imperative for global stability and prosperity. By addressing the root causes of displacement, promoting self-reliance, and fostering inclusive development, we can break the vicious cycle of poverty and displacement, paving the way for a more equitable and resilient world.
