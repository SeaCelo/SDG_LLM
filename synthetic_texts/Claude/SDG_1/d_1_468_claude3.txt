Here is a detailed newspaper article about SDG 1 (No Poverty), written in the tone and style of The Economist:

Pulling the Poorest from the Precipice

The lofty ambition to "end poverty in all its forms everywhere" by 2030 is, at first glance, heart-warmingly idealistic. But on closer inspection, SDG 1 reveals itself to be a supremely pragmatic objective, vital not just for the world's most destitute but for the stability and prosperity of all nations.

Poverty is both root and fruit of so many other global ills. It perpetuates hunger, poor health, lack of access to education, gender discrimination, environmental degradation, and conflict over scarce resources. At the same time, endemic poverty robs economies of productivity, revenues, and domestic consumer markets. It is a vicious, self-reinforcing cycle that drags down rich and poor alike.

The Numbers Behind the Suffering
While the proportion of the world's population living in extreme poverty dropped from 36% in 1990 to 10% in 2015, some 689 million people still subsist on less than $1.90 a day. This number is unconscionably high, representing a concentration of human anguish unfathomable to those who have never lacked life's basic necessities.

But zoom out, and a starker picture emerges. Nearly half the world's population—3.4 billion people—struggles to meet basic needs. And the effects radiate outward like a multi-generational curse. Poverty dramatically increases infant, child, and maternal mortality rates. It is estimated that 5.4 million children under age 5 died in 2017, mainly from preventable causes linked to poverty. Chronic poverty also perpetuates cycles of malnutrition, stunting, and reduced cognitive development that make future poverty even more inevitable.

The Inequality Trap
The bitter irony is that the world is richer than ever before—global GDP surpassed $88 trillion in 2019. But the benefits of economic growth have been dramatically skewed, funneled disproportionately to the wealth-holders at the top while billions remain trapped in varying degrees of poverty. The 26 richest people on earth own as much wealth as the poorest 50%—some 3.8 billion people. 

This level of inequality is fundamentally destabilizing. It breeds resentment, unrest, lack of social mobility, and poor educational and health outcomes for the have-nots. Extreme deprivation and inequality are among the key drivers of migration—both within and between borders—as the poor seek better opportunities wherever they can find them. But this inevitably creates friction with host communities and further fuels nativism and nationalism.

Breaking the Cycle
Achieving SDG 1 will require concerted international effort on multiple fronts. Donor countries will need to ramp up official development aid programs focused on providing access to basic social services, resources, and infrastructure for poor communities. National governments in the developing world must prioritize programs targeting the ultra-poor and facilitating access to entrepreneurship opportunities, financial services, technology, and land rights.

But poverty eradication is not purely an aid challenge. It will necessitate reforming the very systems that enabled such extreme wealth stratification in the first place. Domestic resource mobilization—ensuring governments can adequately tax wealth and economic activity—will be key to sustainable progress. So will initiatives like compensating developing nations for environmental services like forest preservation and carbon sequestration.

Poverty anywhere breeds instability everywhere in an interconnected world. Combating it must be a global priority not just for moral reasons, but for hard-nosed economic and security imperatives as well. SDG 1 is not a quixotic pipe dream, but pragmatic self-preservation for the entire planet.
