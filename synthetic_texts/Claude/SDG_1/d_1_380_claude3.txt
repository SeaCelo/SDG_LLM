The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) presents this comprehensive analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere.

Poverty remains one of the most pressing and multidimensional challenges faced by the global community. Despite significant progress in reducing extreme poverty over the past decades, an estimated 689 million people still lived in extreme poverty in 2017, with a staggering 46% residing in Sub-Saharan Africa. Poverty is intrinsically linked to various socioeconomic factors, including inequality, lack of access to education, healthcare, and decent employment opportunities.

Achieving SDG 1 requires a holistic and inclusive approach that addresses the root causes of poverty and promotes sustainable economic growth. One key strategy is investing in human capital development through improved access to quality education and vocational training programs. This empowers individuals with the skills and knowledge needed to secure decent employment, thereby breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty.

Additionally, strengthening social protection systems and ensuring universal access to essential services such as healthcare, clean water, and sanitation is crucial. In many developing countries, households often face catastrophic out-of-pocket expenditures for healthcare, which can further exacerbate poverty. Implementing robust social safety nets and universal health coverage can mitigate these risks and enhance resilience against economic shocks.

Furthermore, promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth is essential for poverty eradication. This involves fostering an enabling environment for entrepreneurship, micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), and encouraging private sector investment in sectors that generate decent employment opportunities. Initiatives such as improving access to finance, promoting innovative business models, and supporting value chain development can empower marginalized communities and foster inclusive economic participation.

The eradication of poverty is inextricably linked to other SDGs, such as SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 5 (Gender Equality), and SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth). Progress in these areas can create a virtuous cycle that reinforces poverty reduction efforts. For instance, promoting gender equality and empowering women and girls can significantly contribute to poverty alleviation by enhancing their economic participation and decision-making capabilities.

Importantly, addressing climate change and environmental degradation is crucial for sustainable poverty eradication. Climate-related disasters, such as droughts, floods, and natural disasters, disproportionately impact the poor and vulnerable communities, undermining their livelihoods and exacerbating poverty. Investing in climate-resilient infrastructure, promoting sustainable agricultural practices, and enhancing disaster risk management strategies can mitigate these impacts and ensure long-term poverty reduction.

In conclusion, eradicating poverty requires a multifaceted and coordinated approach that harnesses the collective efforts of governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector. By prioritizing human capital development, strengthening social protection systems, promoting inclusive economic growth, addressing climate change, and fostering international cooperation, the global community can make significant strides towards achieving SDG 1 and ensuring a more equitable and sustainable future for all.
