Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 1 (No Poverty), written from the perspective of Randy David, a renowned professor and public intellectual in the Philippines:

Poverty is not simply about income levels or material deprivation. It is a multi-dimensional phenomenon rooted in structural inequalities, social exclusion, and the systematic denial of human dignity. As we grapple with the imperative of eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, as enshrined in the first Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 1), we must confront the deep-seated barriers that perpetuate this scourge across generations.

The Philippines, my homeland, offers a sobering case study. Despite robust economic growth in recent decades, poverty remains entrenched, with over 16% of the population subsisting below the national poverty line. This paradox exposes the myth that economic progress alone can uplift the marginalized. Poverty is sustained by structural deficits – the lack of access to quality education, healthcare, decent work opportunities, and productive resources. It is exacerbated by the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few elite families, a legacy of our colonial past and enduring feudal structures.

Addressing poverty requires a holistic approach that goes beyond stopgap measures or piecemeal interventions. It demands a fundamental recalibration of socio-economic policies to prioritize equity, social protection, and the empowerment of the poor. Investments in human capital development, through accessible and quality education and healthcare systems, are imperative to break the intergenerational cycle of poverty. Equally crucial is the promotion of inclusive economic opportunities, particularly in rural and marginalized communities, through agrarian reform, support for small enterprises, and the formalization of the informal sector.

However, tackling poverty is not merely an economic endeavor; it is a moral and political imperative. It requires dismantling the deeply entrenched systems of patronage, clientelism, and elite capture that have long undermined genuine participatory governance and equitable resource allocation. Poverty persists because it serves the interests of those who benefit from the status quo – the powerful few who wield disproportionate influence over policymaking and resource distribution.

Genuine poverty alleviation necessitates the empowerment of the poor as active agents of change, not mere beneficiaries of top-down interventions. It demands the redistribution of political power, the strengthening of grassroots movements, and the amplification of marginalized voices in decision-making processes. Only through such inclusive and transformative pathways can we dismantle the structures that reproduce poverty and inequality.

Moreover, poverty is inextricably linked to environmental degradation and climate change, which disproportionately impact the most vulnerable communities. Sustainable management of natural resources, promotion of renewable energy, and climate-resilient development strategies are crucial to safeguarding the livelihoods and well-being of the poor, who often rely directly on ecological systems for sustenance.

In the pursuit of SDG 1, we must also confront the global dimensions of poverty. The legacy of colonialism, exploitative trade practices, and the entrenchment of neoliberal economic policies have perpetuated inequalities between and within nations. Addressing poverty requires a fundamental rethinking of the global economic order, one that prioritizes fair trade, debt relief, and the transfer of resources and technology to developing nations.

Ultimately, eradicating poverty is not merely a matter of economic policy or development interventions; it is a moral and ethical imperative that strikes at the heart of our collective humanity. It demands a radical reimagining of our social, political, and economic systems to prioritize the dignity, agency, and well-being of all people, regardless of their circumstances. Only through such transformative efforts can we truly realize the vision of a world free from the scourge of poverty, a world where every individual has the opportunity to thrive and realize their full potential.
