Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 1 (No Poverty), written from the perspective of political commentator Mark Steyn:

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal of eradicating poverty by 2030 is a prime example of starry-eyed utopianism completely untethered from reality. The developing world's teeming masses, expanding at an unsustainable rate, have about as much chance of achieving this lofty goal as I do of being elected President of Zimbabwe. It reeks of Western liberal guilt and flagellating self-abasement, rather than any serious analysis of the core causes of grinding Third World poverty.

At its root, poverty is primarily a cultural phenomenon driven by poor governance, corruption, lack of property rights, and the debilitating overhang of tribal identities and belief systems antagonistic to entrepreneurship and market economies. The great globalist utopians at the UN would have you believe that scattering a few more billions of dollars across the shanty towns of the world will miraculously uplift these societies into modernity. But as decades of failed foreign aid policies have demonstrated, it simply entrenches cultures of dependency and theft without changing underlying structural dysfunctions.

The real poverty eradication success stories of the past half-century have been export-oriented economic powerhouses like Singapore, Taiwan, and South Korea - nations which embraced free market capitalism and rejected the siren song of socialism and Western welfare statism. Their rise proves that the only viable path is promoting economic freedom, secure property rights, low taxes, and light regulation to catalyze entrepreneurship and wealth creation. Poverty flows from lack of capital, lack of access to markets, and lack of human capital development, all of which require embracing Western norms and values rather than clinging to ancient tribal hatreds and mysticism.     

The UN's hopelessly naive SDG campaign papers over these core truths by bleating about "empowerment" and "climate change" distractions. Its aspirational targets calling for social protection systems in every country seek to universalize the Western welfare state which has already driven much of Europe into insolvency. Its injunctions against "income inequality" are fundamentally antithetical to capitalism's creative destruction which rewards innovation and punishes stagnation. The UN's proposed solution - big government central planning on a planetary scale - has already failed catastrophically whether implemented by Brussels bureaucrats or communist revolutionaries.

More Westernization, more globalization, more economic liberty - that is the proven formula for eradicating systemic poverty and elevating the human condition. Not pie-in-the-sky UN utopias peddled by NGO tub-thumpers, recycling warmed-over socialism and resource-transferring guilt-tripping screed. The UN is selling a fantasy; indeed, its very existence is predicated on leeching off the wealth created by the free market dynamism it decries as a root cause of poverty. The bitter truth is that global poverty will persist until the underdeveloped world weans itself off the narcotic of Western aid and eschews multigenerational poverty traps like corruption, religious fatalism, and population overshoot. Harsh realities, I know, but the poor require more than reheated progressive platitudes.
