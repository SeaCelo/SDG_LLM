The eradication of poverty in all its forms remains an elusive yet imperative global objective, inextricably intertwined with the pursuit of sustainable development. The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1, "No Poverty," represents a profound challenge that transcends mere economic considerations, delving into the intricate nexus of social, political, and environmental dynamics.

Addressing poverty through the lens of economic theory necessitates a multidimensional approach, recognizing the inherent complexities and interdependencies that characterize this persistent affliction. Traditional economic models, while providing valuable insights, often fall short in capturing the nuanced realities of poverty, failing to account for the intricate web of structural inequalities, sociocultural factors, and environmental vulnerabilities that perpetuate its intergenerational transmission.

To forge a comprehensive theoretical framework, it is imperative to integrate insights from diverse disciplines, including sociology, anthropology, political science, and environmental studies. This interdisciplinary synthesis enables a holistic understanding of poverty's multifaceted nature, acknowledging the interplay between economic factors and the broader socio-political and ecological contexts in which poverty is embedded.

One prominent theoretical perspective that has gained traction in recent years is the capability approach, pioneered by Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum. This approach shifts the focus from narrow income-based measurements to a broader conception of human well-being, encompassing the freedoms and opportunities individuals have to lead lives they value. By recognizing poverty as a deprivation of capabilities, this framework highlights the intrinsic value of education, health, political freedoms, and environmental quality in shaping individual agency and fostering sustainable livelihoods.

Building upon the capability approach, recent theoretical developments have emphasized the importance of incorporating resilience and adaptive capacity into poverty alleviation strategies. In an era of unprecedented environmental challenges, such as climate change and resource depletion, the ability of individuals and communities to withstand and adapt to shocks and stresses becomes paramount. Integrating resilience thinking into economic theory can inform policies and interventions that enhance the adaptive capacity of vulnerable populations, fostering long-term sustainability and mitigating the disproportionate impacts of environmental degradation on the poor.

Furthermore, the concept of inclusive growth has emerged as a critical lens through which to evaluate economic policies and their implications for poverty reduction. Inclusive growth paradigms emphasize the distribution of economic benefits across all segments of society, recognizing that growth alone is insufficient if its dividends are concentrated among a privileged few. By incorporating measures of inequality, social mobility, and access to opportunities, inclusive growth theories challenge the traditional assumptions of trickle-down economics and underscore the importance of equitable resource allocation and empowerment of marginalized communities.

Ultimately, addressing SDG 1 demands a paradigm shift in economic theory, one that transcends narrow conceptions of poverty and embraces a holistic, multidimensional understanding of human well-being. By integrating insights from diverse disciplines, incorporating resilience thinking, and emphasizing inclusive growth, economic theory can catalyze transformative policy frameworks that address the root causes of poverty while fostering sustainable and equitable development pathways.
