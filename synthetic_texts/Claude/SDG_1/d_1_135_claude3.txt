Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 1 (No Poverty), written from the perspective of comedian and social commentator Mark Steel:

The Tragic Comedy of Global Poverty

By Mark Steel, Distinguished Professor of Irony Studies, Satire University  

Let's state the obvious up front - poverty is no laughing matter. The fact that hundreds of millions of our fellow human beings live in crushing, dehumanizing poverty is one of the great moral failings and policy disasters of our age. It robs people of dignity, opportunity, and far too often, life itself. The global pandemic has only exacerbated this crisis, pushing millions more into the abyss of extreme poverty from which escape seems impossible. You'd have to be a heartless bastard to find any humour in such widespread human misery and suffering.  

And yet, I am chuckling to myself as I write this because the very notion that we clever modern humans haven't yet figured out how to ensure all people can meet their basic needs is darkly, tragically funny in the most perverse way. We have the knowledge, technology, and resources as a global society to end poverty for good, making it the most ridiculously First World problem ever. But instead of using our advanced capabilities for the benefit of all, we seem to be going backwards, with inequality and poverty increasing even in wealthy nations. It's like the human race is stuck in an absurdist play penned by Samuel Beckett after a night of whimsically deconstructing Brewster's Millions.

Take a moment to ponder the sheer outlandishness of it all. On one side of the world, we have grotesquely rich plutocrats and corporations treating money like an online high score, obsessively hoarding more wealth than could ever be spent across multiple lifetimes just for the ego points. On the flip side, nearly half the globe's population - over 3 billion people - tries to scrape by on less than $5.50 per day. Hundreds of millions lack basic sanitation, clean water, nutrition, and often live one hospital visit from bankruptcy. We somehow accept this dysfunctional dichotomy as normal, when it reeks of a bad comedy routine premised on the ludicrous. 

Just imagine a wealthy tycoon and an impoverished laborer walking into a bar, and the punchline is the plutocrat literally owns everything in sight except the tattered rags on the worker's back. It's such an absurd and unbalanced power dynamic, it would make a feudal lords and serfs routine seem nuanced by comparison. You could envision the laborer trying some cutting working class humour about being so poor he couldn't afford the air he's breathing, while the plutocrat laughs heartily without a shred of self-awareness about owning the supply chains for canned oxygen. Far too many in today's world aren't laughing.

If this sounds like a rather bleak brand of comedy, well that's because it is. There's a certain fatalistic mirth in embracing the cringey contradictions of modern capitalism. Of course, the world's richest nations could realistically end extreme poverty with a fraction of the money they spend arming for wars or gifting big business with tax breaks. But then how would those at the top maintain such staggering wealth inequity to spur aspirational avarice for the next generation of robber barons?

These lamentable ironies have inspired many comedians and social satirists over the decades. The late, great Bill Hicks lamented, "Anyone going hungry today is walking around with nothing cool to look forward to." George Carlin lambasted the concept of personal wealth altogether, joking, "Why is there air?" Can't you just see some pompous oligarch inevitably trying to monetize and privatize the atmosphere like a rejected Monty Python sketch?

Forgive my dearth of concrete solutions in this academic treatise. How does one begin to dismantle such a wildly nonsensical global economic system predicated on preserving poverty? Maybe I've been pondering this conundrum so long I've gone madcap, now cackling at the very concept of humanity's potential. Perhaps the greatest cosmic satire of all is that our species developed intelligence, self-awareness, and the stunning theoretical capacity to create widespread abundance - only to squander it so spectacularly. 

Ultimately, the world's fight against poverty looks bleak from a comedic perspective. Our richest wits have been poking fun at income inequality for ages, yet conditions keep worsening as more join the relentless struggle for basic subsistence. The global population living in extreme poverty did fall dramatically over past decades, but the rate is now stalled or reversing. So forgive me if I let out a morbid guffaw at our stunning inability to solve such a ridiculous "problem" of our own invention and perpetuation. After all, what material is riper for satire than the height of human folly?
