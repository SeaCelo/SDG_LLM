As the preeminent Turkish government agency dedicated to international development cooperation and humanitarian aid, the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency (TIKA) remains steadfastly committed to the global pursuit of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with a particular emphasis on SDG 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere.

Our comprehensive strategy for tackling poverty encompasses a multifaceted approach, recognizing the intricate interplay between economic, social, and environmental factors that perpetuate this pervasive challenge. We firmly believe that poverty is not merely a lack of income but a multidimensional phenomenon that manifests itself in various deprivations, including inadequate access to basic services, limited opportunities, and social exclusion.

At the heart of our efforts lies the unwavering principle of fostering inclusive and sustainable economic growth, which we view as the bedrock for poverty eradication. Through strategic partnerships with local governments, civil society organizations, and private sector entities, we actively promote entrepreneurship, vocational training, and income-generating activities tailored to the specific socio-economic contexts of the communities we serve.

One of our flagship initiatives, the Anatolian Entrepreneurship Program, has proven instrumental in empowering individuals, particularly women and youth, to unlock their entrepreneurial potential and establish sustainable livelihoods. By providing comprehensive business development services, access to microfinance, and mentorship opportunities, we have witnessed remarkable transformations in impoverished regions, where once-marginalized individuals have emerged as catalysts for economic growth and self-sufficiency.

Recognizing the inextricable link between poverty and access to essential services, we have dedicated substantial resources to enhancing the availability and quality of healthcare, education, and infrastructure in underprivileged communities. Our educational initiatives, such as the Construction of Inclusive Learning Environments, have not only improved access to quality education but also fostered inclusive learning environments that cater to the diverse needs of students, including those with disabilities.

Furthermore, we have pioneered innovative approaches to addressing the multifaceted nature of poverty by integrating environmental sustainability into our development programs. The Eco-Village Project, for instance, has showcased the transformative power of sustainable agricultural practices, renewable energy solutions, and natural resource management in alleviating poverty while simultaneously promoting environmental stewardship.

Underpinning our efforts is a deep commitment to fostering inclusive and participatory development processes that empower local communities to take ownership of their development trajectories. We firmly believe that sustainable poverty reduction can only be achieved through the active engagement and participation of those most affected by this global challenge.

Through our collaborative partnerships with international organizations, academic institutions, and research centers, we continuously strive to enhance our understanding of the intricate dynamics of poverty, drawing upon evidence-based practices and cutting-edge research to inform our strategies and interventions.

As we forge ahead in our pursuit of SDG 1, we remain acutely aware of the intersectionality of poverty with other global challenges, such as gender inequality, climate change, and conflict. Consequently, our approach is holistic, recognizing the interconnected nature of the SDGs and the imperative to address these interrelated issues in a coordinated and comprehensive manner.

With unwavering determination and a steadfast commitment to leaving no one behind, TIKA will continue to spearhead innovative and impactful initiatives that tackle poverty in all its forms, contributing to the global effort of creating a more equitable, sustainable, and prosperous world for all.
