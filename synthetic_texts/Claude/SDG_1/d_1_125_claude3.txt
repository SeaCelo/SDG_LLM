Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 1 (No Poverty), written from the perspective of Peter Hitchens:

The Vain Pursuit of Ending Poverty: A Hitchensian Critique of SDG 1

By its very premise, the United Nations' first Sustainable Development Goal lays bare the utopian fantasies that have beguiled generations of starry-eyed social planners. The notion that poverty can be legislated out of existence through a series of bureaucratic diktats represents the highest folly of our misguided age. It betrays an arrogant disregard for the immutable complexities of the human condition, complexities which the finest minds of centuries past grasped with far greater wisdom than today's credentialed reformers and their chimerical designs.

Poverty, much like mankind's other frailties and miseries, is an inescapable consequence of our fallen nature. The poor, Christ instructed, would always remain among us—a sobering truth the modern Panglosses have willfully ignored in their pursuit of earthly perfectibility. The UN's poverty elimination campaign is but the latest conceit of an ideological crusade stretching back to the Jacobins, a destructive force that has paved the way for unprecedented state coercion and totalitarian control under the banners of progress and social justice.

One wonders how the luminaries of yore—Aquinas with his profound theological anthropology, Burke with his revering of custom and hereditary wisdom—would have reacted to such an arrogant scheme for remaking humanity in their technocratic mold. Instinctively, they would have sensed the impiety of this materialist undertaking, the essence of which is a denial of humanity's spiritual poverty. It seeks to cure deficits of the soul through the accumulation of worldly possessions—a folly recognized throughout the ages.

The poetic metaphors of William Blake more eloquently capture the consequences of such an endeavor: "A starry night, a solemn round / Of shining worlds in the vast profound / Proclaims the glorious sculptor wise / Who set them in the boundless skies. / But who the sculptor's hand can see / That moulded fair humanity?" To refashion the human form, as the bureaucrats behind SDG 1 so impiously aspire, is to presume the wisdom and vision of that glorious sculptor. It is to claim dominion over a divine realm no mortal dare trespass.

In practical terms, the UN's goal reeks of paternalistic coercion, an assault on the free associations and spontaneous order thattruly ameliorate material deprivation and elevate human dignity. It is the age-old reformist error—an impatient rejection of incrementalism and reliance on established institutions in favor of grandiose, utopian social planning imposed from above. Just as the socialist fantasies of the 20th century yielded only immiseration and tyranny, so too will the SDG campaign sow economic dislocation and subjugate populations to technocratic control under the illusory premise of their betterment.

The prudent path forward would be a respect for the constraints of our imperfect nature, maintaining humility before the invisible hand that governs our tumultuous affairs. It counsels upholding the sanctity of civil society, private property rights, and the family—the organic institutions that have demonstrably alleviated poverty throughout history with greater efficacy than any bureaucratic edict. Those are the fortifying customs which the SDG campaign, in its corrosive utopianism, fundamentally imperils.  

For modernity's tragic flaw is its belief that poverty can be transcended by discarding the wisdom of the ages. It forgets that our material deficiencies are but manifestations of anirredeemable spiritual poverty—a reckoning man has long averted through the eternal verity of his traditions, traditions now assailed by a new breed of credentialed crusaders. The quest to banish want from the earthly realm is thus an idolatry destined for the ash heap, a haughty impediment to rediscovering the truer path of abnegation and grace.
