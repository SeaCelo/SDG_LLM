Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 1 (No Poverty), written from the perspective of Jeff Jacoby, a conservative columnist known for his critique of international aid efforts:

The Noble Mirage of the War on Poverty

In 2015, the United Nations unveiled its overly ambitious "Sustainable Development Goals" — a sweeping agenda of 17 wildly utopian targets to be imposed upon all nations by 2030. Heading the list was the grandiose aim to "end poverty in all its forms everywhere." Let that sink in: eliminating poverty everywhere on the planet within just 15 years. This embarrassingly naïve proposition exemplifies the UN's penchant for top-down, bureaucratic social engineering founded more on good intentions than pragmatic wisdom.

The sad history of the past half-century's governmental anti-poverty campaigns, from Lyndon Johnson's audacious "War on Poverty" to the UN's own ill-fated Millennium Development Goals, has taught us at ruinous cost that throwing ever-more money at poverty tends to perpetuate it rather than ameliorate it. Foreign aid programs routinely foster cultures of dependency, undermine entrepreneurship, enable corruption, distort economies, and sustain the very poverty they claim to fight. The illusion of progress achieved through microloans and conditional cash transfers masks the deeper truth that only economic liberation through free markets and property rights can lift societies out of generational privation.

The UN's definition of "poverty" is itself deeply flawed - an arbitrary income threshold unmoored from cultural contexts and local purchasing power. By this one-size-fits-all standard, over 10% of Americans would be impoverished despite unrivaled access to life's most basic necessities. The fact that global poverty rates have dropped by more than two-thirds since 1990 is certainly welcome, but attributing this progress primarily to UN programs would be a grave disservice to the unheralded engine propelling that success: capitalism.

It was not bureaucratic redistributionism but rather the gradual dismantling of socialist economic policies, from India to China, that catalyzed the greatest anti-poverty campaign the world has ever known. The shift toward free market reforms uplifted well over a billion people from destitution in a few decades - an accomplishment completely unmatched by the UN's vaunted poverty initiatives. Regimes that tightened their statist controls, from North Korea to Venezuela, swiftly immiserated their populations.

As prosperity has advanced through economic freedom, misery and destabilization have trailed many well-intentioned aid efforts. Flooding poor nations with unaccountable assistance hobbled by politically correct diktats erodes their capacity for self-sufficiency. Foreign food aid in particular has repeatedly undermined domestic agriculture and fostered ruinous dependence. If eradicating poverty were a true priority, the UN would pivot from its blinkered focus on wealth redistribution and instead champion trade openness and the secure property rights that empower investment and entrepreneurship.

For all its high-flown rhetoric about human dignity, the UN's hectoring first Sustainable Development Goal reflects the paternalistic arrogance that has long perpetuated global deprivation. Casting off such ideological shackles in favor of an agenda that respects human enterprise and economic liberty would do far more to enable human flourishing than another doomed "moonshot" assault on the ageless fact of poverty. The answer lies not in more aid but in the conditions that nurture independence and self-reliance.
