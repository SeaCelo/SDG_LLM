Eradicating poverty in all its forms remains a fundamental challenge that requires comprehensive and multidimensional interventions. As a signatory to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Azerbaijan has made significant strides in addressing SDG 1: No Poverty, yet persistent inequalities and structural barriers continue to impede progress.

Azerbaijan's commitment to poverty alleviation is reflected in its strategic policies and programs, such as the "Azerbaijan 2020: Look into the Future" development concept and the "Strategic Road Maps on National Economy and Key Sectors of the Economy." These initiatives have led to targeted investments in human capital development, job creation, and social protection systems, underpinned by a strong emphasis on diversifying the economy away from its traditional reliance on the oil and gas sector.

A key achievement has been the substantial reduction in the national poverty rate, which declined from 49.6% in 2001 to 5.1% in 2019, according to the State Statistical Committee. This remarkable progress can be attributed to a combination of factors, including sustained economic growth, increased public investments in infrastructure and social services, and targeted social assistance programs.

However, these national averages mask significant regional disparities and vulnerabilities. Rural areas, particularly in the remote mountainous regions, continue to grapple with higher poverty rates and limited access to essential services. The impact of climate change on agricultural productivity and natural resource management further exacerbates these challenges, underscoring the need for climate-resilient development strategies.

Moreover, certain demographic groups, such as internally displaced persons (IDPs), refugees, and persons with disabilities, face heightened risks of poverty and social exclusion. The ongoing conflict in the Nagorno-Karabakh region has resulted in the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people, placing immense strain on government resources and highlighting the inextricable link between peace, security, and sustainable development.

To address these multifaceted challenges, Azerbaijan has adopted a comprehensive approach that spans various sectors and stakeholders. The "State Program on Poverty Reduction and Sustainable Development for 2019-2023" serves as a strategic framework, emphasizing the importance of inclusive economic growth, improved social protection, and enhanced access to quality education and healthcare.

One notable initiative is the Targeted Social Assistance (TSA) program, which provides cash transfers to low-income households based on a needs-based assessment. This program has played a crucial role in mitigating the impact of poverty and fostering greater social inclusion. However, there is a need to further strengthen the targeting mechanisms and ensure that vulnerable groups, such as refugees and IDPs, have equitable access to these benefits.

Additionally, the government has implemented various employment support programs, including vocational training, entrepreneurship development, and job creation schemes, aimed at promoting sustainable livelihoods and economic empowerment. These efforts are complemented by investments in infrastructure development, particularly in rural areas, to enhance connectivity and access to markets and services.

Recognizing the multidimensional nature of poverty, Azerbaijan has also prioritized investments in human capital development through initiatives like the "State Program on Development of Inclusive Education for Persons with Disabilities (2018-2024)." This program aims to create an inclusive education system that ensures equal opportunities for all children, regardless of their abilities or backgrounds.

Collaboration with international development partners has been instrumental in leveraging expertise, resources, and best practices in poverty reduction efforts. Azerbaijan has actively engaged with organizations such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank, among others, to implement projects that foster sustainable livelihoods, promote social protection, and enhance resilience to economic and environmental shocks.

Moving forward, it is crucial for Azerbaijan to maintain its commitment to poverty eradication and address the remaining challenges through a holistic and inclusive approach. This entails strengthening institutional capacities, enhancing data collection and monitoring systems, and promoting greater policy coherence across sectors.

Additionally, fostering meaningful participation and empowerment of marginalized communities in decision-making processes is essential to ensure that interventions are tailored to their specific needs and circumstances. Innovative financing mechanisms, such as public-private partnerships and impact investments, can be explored to mobilize additional resources and leverage the expertise of diverse stakeholders.

Ultimately, achieving SDG 1 requires a sustained and concerted effort that goes beyond economic growth figures and addresses the root causes of poverty, inequality, and social exclusion. By prioritizing human-centered development, promoting inclusive and resilient societies, and fostering international cooperation, Azerbaijan can pave the way for a future where no one is left behind.
