The eradication of poverty in all its forms remains one of the greatest challenges facing the global community, and it is a challenge that is inextricably linked to the pursuit of sustainable economic development and the promotion of inclusive business practices. As the Journal of International Business Studies, we recognize the pivotal role that multinational enterprises (MNEs) and international business strategies can play in addressing this pressing issue, which is enshrined in the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1): "End poverty in all its forms everywhere."

At the core of this goal lies the recognition that poverty is a multidimensional phenomenon, encompassing not only a lack of income but also deprivations in access to essential services, resources, and opportunities. Consequently, a holistic and multifaceted approach is required, one that leverages the unique capabilities and resources of MNEs to catalyze transformative change.

One critical avenue for MNEs to contribute to the achievement of SDG 1 is through the fostering of inclusive business models. These models seek to integrate low-income communities into the value chain as producers, entrepreneurs, employees, or consumers, thereby creating economic opportunities and enabling them to participate in and benefit from the formal economy. By leveraging their global reach, supply chain expertise, and technological innovations, MNEs can develop products, services, and distribution channels tailored to the needs and constraints of marginalized populations, while simultaneously generating sustainable profits.

However, the pursuit of inclusive business models is not without its challenges. MNEs must navigate complex institutional environments, infrastructural deficiencies, and sociocultural barriers that can impede market entry and operational efficiency. Successful implementation often requires deep contextual understanding, cross-sector collaborations, and a long-term commitment to capacity-building and community empowerment.

Another critical dimension of MNEs' contribution to SDG 1 lies in their ability to shape and influence global economic governance frameworks and policies. Through their engagement with international organizations, advocacy efforts, and adherence to voluntary standards and principles, MNEs can promote an enabling environment for poverty alleviation efforts. This includes supporting policies that foster inclusive economic growth, promote fair trade practices, and safeguard the rights of workers and communities.

Furthermore, MNEs can leverage their financial resources and expertise to support sustainable development initiatives through strategic partnerships, impact investments, and corporate social responsibility programs. By aligning their core business strategies with the principles of shared value creation, MNEs can not only contribute to poverty reduction but also unlock new markets and enhance their long-term competitiveness.

Yet, the role of MNEs in addressing SDG 1 is not without controversies and criticisms. Concerns have been raised about the potential exploitation of vulnerable communities, the perpetuation of economic inequalities, and the prioritization of profit over social impact. Effective governance mechanisms, transparency, and stakeholder engagement are essential to ensure that MNEs' actions are genuinely aligned with the principles of sustainable development and do not exacerbate existing power imbalances or perpetuate patterns of marginalization.

In conclusion, the realization of SDG 1 requires a concerted effort from all sectors of society, including the active participation and commitment of MNEs. By leveraging their unique capabilities, resources, and global reach, MNEs can play a vital role in catalyzing transformative change and creating economic opportunities for the world's most marginalized populations. However, this pursuit must be grounded in ethical principles, respect for human rights, and a genuine commitment to inclusive and sustainable development. It is through this holistic and multifaceted approach that we can collectively work towards ending poverty in all its forms, thereby paving the way for a more equitable and prosperous global society.
