Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 1 (No Poverty), as if written by renowned economics professor Alan Auerbach:

The first of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) - to "end poverty in all its forms everywhere" by 2030 - represents one of the most formidable challenges facing humanity. Despite significant progress over recent decades, extreme poverty remains an intractable crisis on a massive scale. In 2015, just prior to the adoption of the SDGs, roughly 736 million people were estimated to be living in extreme poverty, subsisting on less than $1.90 per day. Moreover, poverty is a multidimensional phenomenon, encompassing not just income deprivation but also lack of access to education, health care, clean water, sanitation, and other vital services. This deprivation leaves hundreds of millions marginalized and excluded from full participation in economic and social life.

Ending poverty requires a multipronged strategy targeting its underlying causes through sustainable interventions at the household, community, national, and global levels. Key elements include promoting inclusive economic growth, investing in human capital development, implementing universal social protection programs, enhancing access to productive resources and financial services for the poor, and mitigating vulnerabilities to economic, environmental and other shocks.  

On a macroeconomic level, the relationship between growth and poverty reduction is well-established. Cross-country research indicates that on average, a 1% increase in GDP per capita translates into a 1.7% reduction in the poverty headcount ratio. However, the growth elasticity of poverty varies widely across countries, ranging from close to zero in some cases to over 3 in others. This elasticity is higher when growth is labor-intensive and concentrated in sectors employed by the poor. Progressive policies to ensure the poor can participate in and benefit from growth are therefore critical, including through greater access to education, finance, land tenure, infrastructure, and technology.

Human capital development through investing in health and education is another vital component. The poor face diminished opportunities due to undernutrition, preventable diseases, inadequate education and skills training, and barriers to accessing quality services. These deprivations perpetuate the intergenerational transmission of poverty. Interventions like conditional cash transfers tied to use of health and education services can help by alleviating short-term income constraints while building long-term human capabilities.

Social protection programs, including cash and in-kind transfers, public works, fee waivers, and subsidies, are proven poverty reducers when properly targeted. Such initiatives enhance resilience and provide a buffer against vulnerabilities arising from economic shocks, natural disasters, climate change, conflict, and other risk factors. However, only 45% of the global population is effectively covered by at least one social protection benefit, illustrating the large remaining gaps.

Access to resources and economic inclusion are also crucial enablers for poverty reduction and prevention. This includes facilitating access to secure land tenure, agricultural inputs, credit, insurance, savings instruments, and productive employment opportunities in both rural and urban areas. Empowering women and removing constraints to their full economic participation is vital, given the disproportionate burdens of poverty they face.

Ultimately, a holistic and sustained approach integrating these various elements is needed to decisively reduce global poverty. This will require significantly scaled domestic resource mobilization, enhanced international cooperation, private sector engagement, and policies ensuring growth is truly inclusive and pro-poor. The costs of inaction are severe - deepening inequality, social instability, environmental degradation, and wasted human potential on a staggering scale. Achieving SDG 1 must be an utmost priority for the global community.
