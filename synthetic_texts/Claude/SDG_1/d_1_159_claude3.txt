The Flat, Hot, and Crowded Path to Ending Poverty

By Thomas Friedman

In today's hyper-globalized world, the fight against poverty has become more complex than ever before. As I outlined in my books The World is Flat and Hot, Flat, and Crowded, we live in an age of dizzying connectivity and accelerating climate change – two unstoppable forces that have profound implications for sustainable development. Ending poverty requires tackling these overarching challenges head-on.

The flattening of the world, driven by rapid technological change, has empowered individuals and communities in the emerging markets like never before. The digital revolution and spread of the internet, mobile phones, and cloud computing have democratized access to information, finance, and markets. From Kenya's M-Pesa mobile money system to India's rural Business Process Outsourcing industry, we've seen how leapfrog technologies can unlock human potential and drive inclusive economic growth.  

At the same time, this hyper-connected world has made the global playing field more competitive and uneven. While billions have been lifted from poverty, many are still struggling to get a foothold on the first rung of the ladder. We've seen a hollowing out of the middle class in advanced economies as good jobs get automated, outsourced or made redundant by software. Meanwhile, a lucrative virtual world for skilled professionals has emerged, creating a brain drain in developing countries.

This great divergence is exacerbated by climate change, which represents the "crowded" piece of the puzzle. The world's poorest – those in parched sub-Saharan Africa or low-lying Bangladesh – had very little to do with causing global warming. And yet, they find themselves on the front lines, subject to droughts, floods, famines and disasters that wipe out years of fragile development gains. It's a cruel injustice that the last will be left behind.

This is the double whammy facing the world's poor: Get richer in a flat world of startling opportunities but also hotter temperatures and more climate volatility that directly threaten food and water supplies. Build resilient communities in this era of accelerations – and do it while the ecological foundations are shifting under everyone's feet.

Ending poverty requires getting a grip on both the flattening and heating risks, which are inextricably intertwined. We need to future-proof growth models to steadily raise living standards while preparing for climate impacts. This means investing in renewable energy leapfrog plays to power growth using decentralized solar, wind and microgrids suited to places with little legacy infrastructure.

Education, particularly for girls and women, must be another priority to boost human capital and labor productivity in a world being reshaped by automation. Climate-smart agriculture techniques like drip irrigation and drought-resistant seeds can bolster food security. Mobile finance can facilitate cash transfers and social safety nets that smooth income volatility in the face of climate shocks.

Simultaneously, we must rethink public-private funding models to turbocharge investment in sustainable infrastructure - from rural roads and electricity access to sanitation and digital connectivity. The rise of innovative financing vehicles like green bonds, social impact bonds, and crowd-funding platforms can be powerful catalysts.

Tackling the multi-dimensional challenge of poverty requires harnessing the dual drivers of technology and sustainable development in a mutually reinforcing fashion. We must empower the poorest with the tools and skills to thrive in a flattening world while hardening their resilience to unavoidable climate stresses. No small feat, but we've already seen the transformative power of mobile phones and internet access to leapfrog development constraints.

In this age of dizzying acceleration, delay simply amplifies disaster. Ending poverty demands acting now with urgency and ambition to build robust, future-oriented societies equipped to prosper on a humble planet growing flatter and hotter by the day. It's the mega-challenge of our era – and our moral responsibility as globalized citizens in this century of climate disruption and economic upheaval.
