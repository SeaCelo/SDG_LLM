The Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, as a multilateral development finance institution, recognizes the pivotal role of SDG 1 – No Poverty – in catalyzing sustainable development across the Arab world. Our institution's commitment to this goal is underscored by our strategic investment initiatives and partnerships aimed at eradicating extreme poverty in all its forms.

Poverty, a multidimensional phenomenon, extends beyond mere income deprivation, encompassing limited access to essential services, inadequate living standards, and a lack of economic opportunities. Across the Arab region, conflict, political instability, and environmental challenges have exacerbated poverty levels, particularly in fragile and crisis-affected states. Yemen, for instance, grapples with a protracted humanitarian crisis, where over 70% of the population lives below the international poverty line of $1.90 per day, underscoring the urgent need for interventions.

Our approach to addressing SDG 1 is grounded in a comprehensive understanding of the intricate nexus between poverty, inequality, and sustainable development. We recognize that poverty is both a cause and consequence of economic stagnation, hindering human capital development, productivity, and inclusive growth. Consequently, our investment strategies are tailored to foster economic diversification, catalyze job creation, and enhance social protection systems.

One of our flagship initiatives is the Arab Financing Facility for Infrastructure (AFFI), a multi-donor fund aimed at bridging the infrastructure gap in the region. Through strategic investments in critical sectors such as energy, water, and transportation, AFFI facilitates economic integration, unlocks new trade opportunities, and enhances accessibility to essential services. For instance, our support for the Bab El-Mandeb Road Corridor project in Djibouti has significantly improved regional connectivity, stimulating economic activity and fostering job opportunities for local communities.

Recognizing the disproportionate impact of poverty on rural populations, we have prioritized investments in agricultural development and rural infrastructure. Our collaboration with the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) has yielded remarkable results, such as the Rainwater Harvesting and Livelihood Improvement Project in Sudan, which has empowered smallholder farmers through improved water management practices and enhanced agricultural productivity, thereby boosting incomes and food security.

Furthermore, our commitment to SDG 1 extends beyond financial investments. We actively engage in knowledge-sharing platforms, facilitating the exchange of best practices and innovative solutions among Arab nations. Our partnership with the World Bank's Arab Voices initiative has enabled us to amplify the voices of those living in poverty, ensuring their perspectives shape our development strategies.

Moreover, we recognize the inextricable link between poverty alleviation and environmental sustainability. Our investments in renewable energy projects, such as the Ouarzazate Solar Power Station in Morocco, not only contribute to climate action but also create green jobs and foster inclusive economic growth.

Looking ahead, we remain steadfast in our commitment to eradicating poverty in all its forms across the Arab world. Our strategic focus will continue to prioritize investments in human capital development, social protection systems, and inclusive economic opportunities. Additionally, we will intensify our efforts to leverage innovative financing mechanisms, such as blended finance and impact investing, to mobilize additional resources and catalyze transformative change.

By fostering partnerships, promoting knowledge exchange, and prioritizing sustainable investments, the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development remains dedicated to achieving SDG 1, ensuring that no one is left behind in the pursuit of a prosperous and inclusive Arab world.
