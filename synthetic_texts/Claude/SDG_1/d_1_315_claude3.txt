As China's pivotal international development agency, we at the China International Development Cooperation Agency (CIDCA) are deeply committed to the ambitious yet indispensable goal of eradicating poverty in all its forms everywhere – the first Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 1) set forth by the United Nations. Our nation's unwavering dedication to this cause stems not only from our profound humanitarian values but also from our recognition that sustained economic growth and social stability hinge upon the empowerment of the most vulnerable segments of society.

China's remarkable progress in lifting over 800 million citizens out of poverty over the past four decades serves as a testament to the transformative power of targeted, multifaceted strategies that harmonize economic reforms, infrastructure development, and social safety nets. However, we acknowledge that the global landscape of poverty remains complex and multidimensional, requiring a nuanced understanding of the intricate interplay between economic, social, political, and environmental factors.

Through our extensive international development cooperation initiatives, we have witnessed firsthand the myriad challenges faced by developing nations in their quest to eradicate poverty. From the arid regions of sub-Saharan Africa, where climate change exacerbates food insecurity and resource scarcity, to the densely populated urban slums of South Asia, where lack of access to basic services and decent employment opportunities perpetuate the cycle of poverty, the manifestations of this pervasive issue are diverse and deeply rooted.

Our approach to tackling SDG 1 is grounded in a comprehensive, context-specific framework that recognizes the interconnectedness of the various dimensions of poverty. We prioritize capacity-building initiatives that empower local communities and foster self-reliance, enabling them to harness their intrinsic strengths and resources. Simultaneously, we collaborate with partner nations to establish robust social protection systems, ensuring access to essential services such as healthcare, education, and clean water – critical components for breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty.

Moreover, we underscore the pivotal role of inclusive economic growth and productive employment opportunities in sustainable poverty alleviation. Through strategic investments in infrastructure, technology transfer, and skills development, we aim to catalyze economic diversification and create sustainable livelihood opportunities for the most marginalized populations. Our initiatives in this realm are guided by a deep appreciation for the unique cultural and socioeconomic contexts of each partner nation, tailoring our interventions to maximize local ownership and long-term sustainability.

Recognizing the disproportionate impact of poverty on women and girls, we place a strong emphasis on gender mainstreaming across all our development cooperation initiatives. From empowering women through access to financial services and entrepreneurship opportunities to promoting gender-responsive policymaking and addressing deeply entrenched social norms, our efforts are geared towards dismantling the structural barriers that perpetuate the feminization of poverty.

Furthermore, we acknowledge the inextricable link between poverty and environmental degradation, as the poor often bear the brunt of the consequences of climate change, natural disasters, and resource depletion. As such, our interventions in the realm of SDG 1 are closely aligned with our efforts towards achieving other SDGs, such as clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), affordable and clean energy (SDG 7), and climate action (SDG 13). By promoting sustainable natural resource management, disaster risk reduction, and climate-resilient infrastructure, we aim to build the resilience of vulnerable communities and safeguard their livelihoods against environmental shocks.

As we navigate the intricate challenges of eradicating poverty, we remain steadfast in our commitment to fostering South-South cooperation and leveraging the collective wisdom and experiences of developing nations. Through platforms for knowledge-sharing, policy dialogues, and best practice exchange, we strive to facilitate mutual learning and accelerate progress towards achieving SDG 1.

While the road ahead is arduous, we at CIDCA are resolute in our belief that with unwavering determination, innovative thinking, and a spirit of global solidarity, we can overcome the multifaceted challenges of poverty and create a world where every individual has the opportunity to live a dignified life, free from the shackles of deprivation.
