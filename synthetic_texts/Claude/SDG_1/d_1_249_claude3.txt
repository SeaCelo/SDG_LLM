Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 1 (No Poverty), written from the perspective of John Michael Van Reenen, a renowned economist:

Eradicating extreme poverty has been a longstanding global imperative, but one that has proven stubbornly challenging to achieve. The United Nations' first Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 1) squarely tackles this issue by calling for an end to poverty in all its forms everywhere by 2030. As an economist focused on innovation, productivity and institutional dynamics, I believe bold new policy approaches grounded in rigorous evidence will be crucial for making substantive progress on this front.

We must first acknowledge the immense scale and complexity of the poverty challenge. Despite the remarkable expansion of the global economy over recent decades, nearly 10% of the world's population still lived on less than $1.90 per day in 2015. This concentrates in developing regions like sub-Saharan Africa, but high poverty rates persist even in rapidly growing economies like India. Poverty is both a cause and consequence of poor health, limited education, social exclusion, environmental degradation, and myriad other interlinked deprivations that perpetuate disadvantage across generations.

Tackling such a multi-dimensional problem requires multifaceted solutions across sectors like agriculture, infrastructure, social protection, and economic policymaking. A key insight from modern growth theory is that productivity - the efficiency with which labor and capital inputs are transformed into outputs - is the ultimate driver of sustained income gains and poverty reduction. Therefore, policies that enhance productivity by improving human capital, removing market distortions, strengthening institutions, and incentivizing innovation should be prioritized.

Well-designed conditional cash transfer programs, for example, have proven highly effective in reducing poverty through targeted income support while also incentivizing investments in children's health and education that boost long-term earnings potential. India's pioneering biometric identification system (Aadhaar) has helped enable secure and cost-effective delivery of such programs at scale. Additionally, reducing barriers to labor mobility through flexible housing and land policies enables workers to pursue more productive opportunities.

At the same time, accelerating agricultural productivity growth in the rural regions where most of the world's poor reside is imperative. Public investments in agricultural R&D, irrigation infrastructure, extension services, and market access have high social returns but often face funding gaps. New technologies like precision agriculture and mobile banking also hold significant anti-poverty potential if coupled with efforts to expand digital connectivity and human capital in rural areas.

Of course, productivity-enhancing policies will be most effective when complemented by efforts to broaden access to quality education, healthcare, and institutions that foster economic and political inclusion. In this light, SDG 1 cannot be viewed in isolation - it is fundamentally interlinked with the achievement of other Goals related to hunger, health, gender equality, infrastructure, and more. Effective poverty reduction strategies must account for these synergies.

A major challenge, however, is ensuring sufficient domestic resource mobilization to finance the multi-billion dollar public investments needed, especially in the poorest and most fragile states. This requires strengthening tax administrations, curbing illicit financial flows, and realigning spending priorities. The international community also has a vital role through increased Official Development Assistance and multilateral coordination mechanisms like the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data. 

Critically, we must view the SDGs not as a top-down agenda but as a process of iterative experimentation and course correction grounded in rigorous evaluation. We need more randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies to isolate which policies and implementation approaches work best in various contexts. Open data-sharing platforms and research-policy feedback loops are vital for enabling rapid diffusion of successful innovations.

Eliminating poverty within a generation is an immense challenge, but the welfare gains for billions globally would be transformative. Economists have much to contribute through sharpening policy targeting and unpacking the incentives, constraints, and general equilibrium effects at play. But success will ultimately hinge on mustering sustained political will aligned with the latest evidence. The global community must treat SDG 1 not as an abstract ideal, but as an utterly vital investment in our shared, sustainable prosperity. The economic and moral costs of inaction are simply too catastrophic to contemplate.
