As the preeminent multilateral development finance institution dedicated to the Latin American and Caribbean region, the Development Bank of Latin America and the Caribbean (CAF) remains steadfastly committed to the ambitious undertaking of eradicating poverty in all its forms. Our resolute efforts towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1) – "End poverty in all its forms everywhere" – are guided by a multidimensional and nuanced understanding of the intricate challenges that pervade our region.

Poverty, a deeply entrenched and multifaceted phenomenon, manifests itself not only through income deprivation but also through a pernicious cycle of limited access to essential services, social exclusion, and vulnerability to economic shocks and natural disasters. Recognizing this complexity, CAF has adopted a comprehensive approach that addresses the structural drivers of poverty while simultaneously fortifying the resilience of vulnerable populations.

At the core of our strategy is a steadfast commitment to promoting inclusive economic growth. We actively foster an enabling environment for private sector development, encouraging job creation and entrepreneurship, especially in sectors with high potential for labour absorption and value addition. Simultaneously, we advocate for progressive fiscal policies that prioritize investments in human capital, social protection systems, and targeted interventions for marginalized groups, including indigenous communities, women, and rural populations.

Recognizing the inextricable link between poverty and environmental degradation, CAF has emerged as a regional leader in promoting sustainable development pathways. We actively support the transition towards a low-carbon, resource-efficient economy, facilitating access to clean energy, sustainable infrastructure, and climate-resilient technologies. By mitigating the adverse impacts of climate change and environmental degradation, we aim to safeguard the livelihoods and well-being of the most vulnerable populations, many of whom depend directly on natural resources for their subsistence.

Moreover, CAF's interventions extend beyond traditional financial support. We actively engage in capacity-building initiatives, knowledge sharing, and policy dialogues, fostering an enabling environment for evidence-based decision-making and regional cooperation. Through our technical assistance programs, we empower local governments, civil society organizations, and grassroots communities to design and implement context-specific solutions tailored to their unique challenges.

Our analytical work and policy research have shed light on the intricate dynamics of poverty in the region, informing our strategic priorities and lending operations. For instance, our recent study on the multidimensional nature of poverty in Latin America and the Caribbean revealed alarming disparities in access to education, healthcare, and basic services, even among populations above the income poverty line. This insight has prompted us to adopt a more holistic approach, integrating investments in human development and social infrastructure with traditional poverty alleviation measures.

Furthermore, recognizing the heterogeneity of our region, we have developed tailored interventions to address the unique challenges faced by specific sub-regions and country contexts. In the Caribbean, for instance, our efforts have focused on enhancing resilience to natural disasters and climate change impacts, given the region's high vulnerability to these threats. Similarly, in the Andean region, we have prioritized initiatives that promote inclusive rural development, addressing the disproportionate poverty levels among indigenous and agricultural communities.

As we forge ahead, CAF remains committed to leveraging our expertise, financial resources, and strategic partnerships to catalyze transformative change in the region. We firmly believe that eradicating poverty in all its forms is not only a moral imperative but also a prerequisite for achieving sustainable and inclusive development in Latin America and the Caribbean.
