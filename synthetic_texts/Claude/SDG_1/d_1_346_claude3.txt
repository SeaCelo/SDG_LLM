As the leading agency promoting sustainable development and poverty eradication in Spain, the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID) is proud to present this comprehensive analysis of the current progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1): End poverty in all its forms everywhere.

Despite significant progress in recent decades, extreme poverty remains a pressing challenge affecting millions of people worldwide. According to the latest World Bank data, in 2019, approximately 648 million people lived on less than $1.90 per day, the international poverty threshold. This alarming figure underscores the urgent need for concerted action and innovative strategies to address the root causes of poverty.

One of the greatest obstacles to achieving SDG 1 is the lack of equitable access to resources and economic opportunities. In many developing countries, structural inequalities and wealth gaps persist, exacerbated by factors such as conflict, political instability, and climate change. These systemic barriers prevent people from escaping poverty and reaching their full potential.

It is crucial to tackle these inequalities through the implementation of inclusive policies and robust social protection programs. These should focus on ensuring universal access to basic services such as education, healthcare, and clean water, as well as promoting opportunities for decent employment and sustainable livelihoods. Investing in human capital through education and vocational training is essential to empower individuals and equip them with the skills needed to thrive in a globalized economy.

Additionally, it is vital to address the environmental and climate challenges that threaten the livelihoods of millions of people around the world. Environmental degradation, resource scarcity, and extreme weather events can undermine development efforts and perpetuate cycles of poverty. Therefore, solutions to eradicate poverty must be intrinsically linked to environmental protection and the promotion of sustainable practices.

In this regard, AECID has played a key role in promoting international cooperation and cross-sectoral collaboration to address the multidimensional challenges of poverty. Our programs and projects focus on key areas such as economic empowerment, access to basic services, climate resilience, and inclusive governance.

One notable example is our comprehensive rural development project in Guatemala, which combines sustainable agricultural approaches, access to microcredits, and business training to empower indigenous communities and improve their livelihoods. Additionally, our social protection program in Mozambique has provided conditional cash transfers and health and nutrition services to vulnerable families, significantly improving their food security and overall well-being.

These examples highlight the importance of adopting holistic and integrated approaches to addressing poverty in all its dimensions. Only through coordinated and collaborative efforts among governments, international organizations, the private sector, and civil society can we make significant progress toward eradicating poverty and achieving SDG 1.

At AECID, we are committed to continuing to play a leading role in this crucial fight by mobilizing resources, sharing knowledge, and fostering innovative partnerships. Together, we can build a fairer and more equitable world, where everyone has the opportunity to reach their full potential and live a dignified and prosperous life.
