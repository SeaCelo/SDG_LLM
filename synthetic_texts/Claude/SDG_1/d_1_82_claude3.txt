Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 1 (No Poverty), written from the perspective of Bachi Karkaria, an Indian journalist and author known for her insights on social issues:

Poverty is both persistent and pervasive, an affront to human dignity that continues to plague our world. The first of the Sustainable Development Goals puts forth an ambitious vision: to end poverty in all its forms everywhere by 2030. Lofty words, no doubt. But what do they truly mean for the 689 million people still subsisting on less than $1.90 a day? 

India knows the scourge of destitution intimately. Despite our nation's economic rise, millions remain trapped in intergenrational cycles of deprivation. The very poverty that Mahatma Gandhi fought to eradicate over 75 years ago still has an iron grip, denying basic rights and perpetuating social exclusion.

Poverty's grasp extends beyond mere income shortfalls. It deprives children of nutrition, robbing them of the opportunity to grow, to learn, to reach their full potential. It denies families access to quality healthcare when illness strikes. It forces the poor to make Faustian bargains, pulling children from school into labor to help make ends meet. Poverty corrodes human capital and constrains economic mobility.

Viewing poverty through this multidimensional lens reveals how deeply it is intertwined with issues of gender, caste, religion and geography. The poor in India's villages suffer its yoke most acutely, with seven out of every eight impoverished individuals residing in rural areas. Economic, social and cultural barriers conspire to concentrate poverty's burden among vulnerable groups like religious minorities, lower castes and tribal populations. 

And then there are the "feminizations" of poverty - the ways in which women disproportionately shoulder the burdens. Their work is undervalued, their property rights circumscribed, their access to financial services restricted. When drought or disaster strikes, women resort to desperate coping mechanisms like pulling daughters from school or entering exploitative labor markets. Domestic violence further imperils their precarious existence. Poverty is thus patriarchy's unholy companion.

The world today produces sufficient food for everyone. And yet, hunger persists as poverty's cruellest manifestation. In India, nearly 195 million people are undernourished. This paradox is particularly grotesque when one considers our nation's prodigious food waste and distortion-riddled agriculture markets. Solving endemic hunger necessitates more than just increased production - it requires holistic policy solutions spanning nutrition, sanitation, agriculture and social protection.

If poverty's hold is to be broken, strategic interventions must precisely target its root causes through effective policies, robust institutions and an enabling environment for the poor to build economic resilience. Initiatives like the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act exemplify the type of transformative social protection needed, ensuring dignified employment opportunities as a bulwark against rural poverty's grasp.

Ultimately, the struggle against destitution hinges on forging a new economic model centered on inclusive growth - one where the rising tide truly lifts all boats. Decent job creation, human capital investment and progressive taxation can ensure India's development dividend is more equitably shared. Empowering the poor, especially women and disadvantaged groups, must be a national priority. Their upward mobility is the purest path to sustainable prosperity.

As India charts its development trajectory, ensuring "no one is left behind" must be the lodestar. Ending poverty's grip is both a moral imperative and an existential investment in our collective future. Heeding Gandhi's words, we must be the change we wish to manifest in this world - a world free from want, a world of justice and human flourishing for all.
