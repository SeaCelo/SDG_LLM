Here is a draft newspaper article about SDG 1 (No Poverty), written from the perspective of the Harvard Business Review:

The Business Imperative to End Poverty: How Companies Drive Progress on SDG 1

By 2030, the United Nations aims to eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, universally measuring poverty as those living on less than $1.25 a day. This bold ambition, enshrined as the first Sustainable Development Goal, represents an extraordinary humanitarian and economic challenge – but also an immense opportunity for responsible businesses.  

Poverty perpetuates a debilitating cycle of diminished health, limited education, and restricted economic opportunities that restrains human potential and global markets. Currently, over 700 million people subsist in extreme poverty, disproportionately concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia. Empowering this population to rise above mere subsistence unlocks transformative personal, social, and economic benefits.

Innovative business leaders across industries recognize that sustainable poverty reduction creates value by expanding workforce capabilities, growing consumer markets, and cultivating more resilient communities as suppliers and partners. Economic inclusion elevates overall productivity and spurs new avenues for entrepreneurship. Companies that proactively enable this progression toward shared prosperity enhance their brand equity, reduce operational risks, and uncover novel commercial opportunities – all while doing social good.  

Starbucks, for example, instituted comprehensive ethical sourcing practices to ensure its coffee is sourced from growers earning fair wages, with a premium paid for sustainable farming methods. This creates a positive cyclical impact, as rising grower incomes enable increased household investments in nutrition, education, and community development. Starbucks benefits from a more stable long-term supply chain.

Corporations can drive progress across the intersecting drivers of poverty, such as access to quality education, healthcare, clean water & sanitation, affordable energy, and decent work opportunities. PayPal pioneers novel mobile money platforms to facilitate secure digital payments and expand financial inclusion for the unbanked poor, while also enabling small business growth. IKEA's supply chain initiatives help lift economies through renewable energy investments, sustainable agriculture programs, and ethical subcontractor standards.

Multistakeholder partnerships between corporations, governments, NGOs, and social enterprises allow companies to amplify their positive impact. The Coca-Cola Company collaborates with USAID andcivil society groups worldwide to promote community water stewardship, sustainable packaging, and economic empowerment. Royal DSM partners with the World Food Programme to fortify staple foods and combat malnutrition through the potent micronutrient combinations.

Crucially, companies must move beyond isolated corporate social responsibility projects to fundamentally realign business models and strategies with poverty reduction and the SDGs. This systemic approach protects corporate interests by investing in inclusive growth of communities as consumers, employees, and economic stakeholders. Entrenched poverty anywhere breeds instability that reverberates globally in our interdependent world, jeopardizing markets and disrupting human capital and supply chains.  

For companies, ending poverty is pragmatic self-interest that enables long-term business success. But beyond the business case, it is a moral and economic imperative to uplift human dignity and harness our full potential as a global community. The business leaders who recognize this charge and embed the SDGs into their core operations will reap the benefits of enhanced societal and shareholder value creation.
