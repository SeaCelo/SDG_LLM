The eradication of poverty in all its forms remains one of the greatest challenges facing humanity. Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1), which aims to "end poverty in all its forms everywhere," represents a profound commitment to addressing this complex and multifaceted issue. Experimental economics, with its unique methodological approaches and rigorous empirical framework, has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating the intricate dynamics of poverty and evaluating interventions aimed at its alleviation.

Poverty is a multidimensional phenomenon that extends beyond mere income deprivation, encompassing a wide range of deprivations in areas such as access to education, healthcare, and basic infrastructure. Consequently, tackling poverty requires a holistic approach that addresses these interrelated dimensions. Experimental economics, with its ability to isolate and manipulate specific variables in controlled environments, has proven invaluable in disentangling the complex web of factors contributing to poverty and identifying effective interventions.

One of the key contributions of experimental economics to the study of poverty has been the exploration of behavioral factors that influence decision-making and economic outcomes. Traditional economic models often assume rational, utility-maximizing behavior, but experimental evidence has consistently demonstrated that individuals frequently deviate from these assumptions, particularly in contexts of scarcity and resource constraints. By incorporating insights from psychology and behavioral economics, researchers have gained a deeper understanding of the cognitive biases, social norms, and psychological factors that shape economic decisions among the poor.

Field experiments, which involve conducting randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in real-world settings, have been particularly valuable in evaluating the effectiveness of anti-poverty interventions. These experiments allow researchers to rigorously test the impact of various policy interventions, such as conditional cash transfers, microfinance initiatives, or educational programs, on a range of outcomes including income, consumption, human capital accumulation, and subjective well-being. The strength of RCTs lies in their ability to establish causal relationships and minimize confounding factors, providing policymakers with robust evidence to inform decision-making.

Moreover, experimental economics has shed light on the role of social interactions, networks, and institutions in shaping economic behavior and outcomes among the poor. By designing experiments that incorporate elements of social interaction, researchers have explored how factors such as trust, reciprocity, and social norms influence economic decision-making and the adoption of new technologies or practices. This understanding is crucial for designing interventions that are not only economically viable but also socially and culturally appropriate.

Furthermore, experimental economics has made significant contributions to our understanding of risk and uncertainty preferences among the poor. The poor often face significant risks and uncertainties in their daily lives, which can have profound implications for their economic decisions and outcomes. By eliciting risk preferences through incentivized experiments, researchers have gained insights into how the poor make decisions under uncertainty and how these preferences may influence their participation in various economic activities or their willingness to adopt new technologies or practices.

Despite these advancements, several challenges persist in the application of experimental economics to the study of poverty and the achievement of SDG 1. One critical challenge is the external validity and scalability of experimental findings. While experiments provide valuable insights into causal relationships and mechanisms, translating these findings into large-scale, sustainable interventions requires careful consideration of context-specific factors and potential unintended consequences.

Additionally, the ethical implications of conducting experiments involving vulnerable populations, such as the poor, must be carefully navigated. Ensuring informed consent, minimizing potential harm, and ensuring fair treatment and compensation for participants are paramount considerations. Researchers must also grapple with the potential for experimental interventions to create unintended distortions or dependencies within communities, underscoring the need for responsible and ethical research practices.
