Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 1 (No Poverty), written from the perspective of Robert J. Shiller:

The quest to end poverty in all its forms everywhere is not only a moral imperative, but an existential economic necessity. As a renowned economist and author, I have long been fascinated by the driving forces behind asset prices and the narratives that shape markets. However, it has become increasingly clear that extreme poverty represents a systemic risk to global financial stability and sustainable economic growth.

At its core, poverty is the result of a failure of narrative economics - the study of the epidemiology of popular economic narratives which spread like disease and drive major economic events. The dominant narrative that has taken hold is one that normalizes extreme inequality as an inevitable consequence of market capitalism, rather than a solvable crisis that demands urgent, collective action.

This damaging narrative is not only morally bankrupt but economically destructive. Unchecked, poverty perpetuates cycles of low productivity, poor health, lack of education, environmental degradation, and social unrest - all of which erode the foundations of prosperous markets and sap vitality from our human capital. It is a tragically self-reinforcing feedback loop where poverty begets more poverty across generations.

We must rewrite this narrative from the ground up, replacing it with one centered on the tangible economic benefits of achieving SDG 1. Investing in the eradication of poverty is, in essence, meant to correct one of the biggest negative externalities of modern capitalism. It disrupts patterns of chronic underinvestment in human potential that represent a staggering deadweight loss for the global economy.

Consider a world where the 736 million people living in extreme poverty could fully participate as entrepreneurs, innovators, consumers, and flourishing members of society. This unlocked human capital would catalyze a virtuous cycle of increased demand, productive investment, technological progress, and inclusive economic growth. Perhaps counterintuitively, tackling poverty at its roots may be the highest return venture for boosting global GDP over the long run.

Of course, this is an audacious endeavor fraught with complexities. A multitude of direct interventions will be required across areas like education, healthcare, infrastructure, social protection, economic inclusion, and institutional reform. Yet the potential benefits are transformative: Improving lives, reducing conflict, mitigating environmental destruction, and powering a new era of robust, sustainable prosperity and human welfare.

Critically, we must reject the misconception of this goal as an unaffordable drain on resources. It represents an investment that will pay a premium over time in the form of a more dynamic, resilient world economy. The question is not whether we can afford to end poverty, but whether we can afford the systemic risks of allowing it to persist indefinitely.

Reframing this imperative through a narrative economic lens makes a powerful case that aligns moral purpose with rational self-interest. Like fighting climate change, achieving SDG 1 is about managing core economic risks over the long term. It is the ultimate institutional investment in stabilizing and advancing global markets.

The time is ripe to craft a new, compelling narrative around ending poverty as an integral pillar of financial stability and sustainable growth. With concerted international cooperation, realigned incentives, and investment at scale, we can rewrite this stubborn story of our time. In doing so, we will unlock prosperity far beyond what we can presently envision. This goal represents nothing less than an opportunity to stabilize and fortify the foundations of the global economy for generations to come.
