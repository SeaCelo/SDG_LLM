The Cosmic Trailer Park: A Look at the Sadness of Global Poverty

By Gene Weingarten

I'd like to begin this piece with a deeply unfair comparison that will belittle the suffering of millions around the world. Here it is: Think of the saddest movie scene you've ever witnessed. For me, it's the horse getting shocked with a pitchfork and put down in the opening scene of The Neverending Story. Or maybe it was when Wilson floated away in Cast Away. Dammit, those WERE sad. But you know what's infinitely sadder? The fact that nearly 10 percent of the world's population lives in such abject poverty that a bad day for them would make even the sourest persimmon wither in empathetic anguish.

We're talking about 689 million human beings existing (can you even call it that?) on less than $1.90 per day. That's the international poverty line - an obscenely low threshold agreed upon by the neoliberal pamphlet-writers at the World Bank. But even they acknowledge that relying on such an arbitrary metric defined by purchasing power parity is a bit like performing a protological tautology to measure the size of the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs. It tells you something, but not enough.

The true depths of third-world destitution are damn near impossible to fathom for those of us ensconced in the muffin-topped plenitude of modern American suburbia. We use the phrase "starving children in Africa" as a smokescreen of tidy pretension, distancing ourselves from the Boschian hellscape that is daily life for those trapped in poverty's cosmic trailer park.

Let's get viscerally honest here. I'm talking about parents having to decide whether to spend what little money they have on food for their withering infant or life-saving medicine for their dying grandmother. I'm talking about an endless loop of malnutrition, inadequate sanitation, lack of access to education, economic immobility, disease, and death. It's a supernova of compounded misery from which there is no easy escape.

And before you get all puffed up about how much richer nations "give" to the poor countries every year, let's tap the brake a bit. It's a misleading figure muddled by self-interest - much of it is return investment rather than altruistic aid. We're really just sprinkling fistfuls of love on a terminally ill patient, hoping for the best.

The truly sobering statistic? Estimates say that it would take just $336 billion per year to virtually eliminate consumption poverty around the globe. You read that right - about one-tenth of the almost $4 trillion in total private wealth currently enjoyed by America's 664 billionaires. Hell, you could solve a huge chunk of the problem by having them all kick in half their net worth, and they'd still be able to buy a medium pizza if they were peckish.

So what's the solution here? Your garden-variety bleeding heart liberal would say we need more foreign aid, more government programs, more private charity. A starry-eyed socialist purist might float the idea of abolishing money altogether and ushering in a utopian workers' paradise. But I'm going to leave you with an idea that's far more practical, and sadistically on-brand for a satirical misanthrope like myself:

Leave it all exactly as it is. Because the awful truth that no one wants to admit? The impoverished masses of the world do us a favor by their very existence and untold suffering. They are an eternal reminder of just how horrifically fortunate we are in our comfortable lives of decadent abundance. Every time we bite into a surprisingly decent Egg McMuffin on our hungover Sunday morning, we should be thanking the heavens that our biggest worry that day is getting a stubborn smear of hollandaise out of our ironic Lisa Frank t-shirt and not
