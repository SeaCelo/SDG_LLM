The International Red Cross, a global humanitarian organization dedicated to alleviating human suffering, presents this analytical report on the progress and challenges associated with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1): "End poverty in all its forms everywhere."

Despite significant strides made in reducing global poverty rates over the past decades, the COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly set back progress, exacerbating existing vulnerabilities and inequalities. According to estimates by the World Bank, the pandemic pushed an additional 119 million to 124 million people into extreme poverty in 2020, marking the first increase in global poverty rates since 1998.

Poverty is a multidimensional phenomenon, encompassing not only income deprivation but also lack of access to essential services, limited economic opportunities, and social exclusion. Addressing poverty requires a holistic approach that tackles its root causes and creates an enabling environment for sustainable livelihoods.

In fragile and conflict-affected contexts, where the International Red Cross has a significant operational presence, poverty is often deeply entrenched and exacerbated by complex emergencies. Protracted crises, such as those in Syria, Yemen, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, have led to widespread displacement, disruption of livelihoods, and erosion of essential services, trapping communities in cycles of poverty and vulnerability.

Poverty's intersectionality with other SDGs is undeniable. For instance, lack of access to quality education (SDG 4) and decent work opportunities (SDG 8) can perpetuate intergenerational poverty cycles. Similarly, poverty can exacerbate health risks (SDG 3) and increase vulnerability to the impacts of climate change (SDG 13), further compounding existing deprivations.

The International Red Cross recognizes the importance of addressing poverty through a multifaceted approach that encompasses humanitarian assistance, resilience building, and advocacy for inclusive and equitable policies. In emergency settings, our organization provides essential relief, such as food, shelter, and healthcare, to alleviate immediate deprivations. However, we also prioritize long-term recovery and resilience-building initiatives to empower communities and strengthen their self-reliance.

For example, in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake in Nepal in 2015, the International Red Cross implemented a comprehensive recovery program that included cash transfers, livelihood support, and the reconstruction of resilient housing. This integrated approach not only addressed immediate needs but also laid the foundation for sustainable poverty reduction by restoring economic opportunities and enhancing disaster preparedness.

In protracted crises, such as the Syrian refugee crisis, the International Red Cross has implemented innovative solutions to support livelihoods and promote self-reliance. One such initiative is the Livelihood Resource Transfer program, which provides refugees with a combination of cash grants, training, and business development support to establish or revive income-generating activities. This approach not only addresses immediate financial needs but also empowers individuals and families to regain control over their lives and break free from the cycle of aid dependency.

Advocacy and partnerships are also crucial components of our efforts to eradicate poverty. The International Red Cross actively engages with governments, international organizations, and civil society to promote inclusive and equitable policies that address the root causes of poverty. We advocate for the protection of vulnerable groups, such as displaced persons and marginalized communities, and promote their access to essential services and economic opportunities.

Furthermore, we recognize the importance of collaborating with local partners and leveraging their contextual knowledge and expertise. By working closely with community-based organizations and grassroots initiatives, we can better understand local dynamics, design culturally appropriate interventions, and ensure sustainable impact.

As we move forward in our efforts to achieve SDG 1, the International Red Cross remains steadfast in its commitment to addressing poverty in all its forms. We continue to adapt our strategies to evolving challenges, embrace innovative approaches, and foster partnerships that amplify our collective impact. Only through a coordinated and inclusive approach can we truly end poverty and create a more equitable and sustainable world for all.
