Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 1 (No Poverty), written from the perspective of satirical novelist Carl Hiaasen:

A Paradise of Poverty in Paradise: Exposing Florida's Wretched Income Divide

For too long, Florida has maintained a split personality when it comes to poverty. On one side you have the facade - the glossy tourism ads and development pitches touting our white sandy beaches, turquoise waters, and vibrant culture as the ultimate vacation paradise. Yet lurking behind the maskara'd veneer is an ugly underbelly of economic privation rotting away at the core.

The statistics are as jarring as a snapping turtle bite. Over 3 million Floridians, one in seven, subsist in poverty according to the latest census data. In the Miami metro area, a staggering 16.5% live below the poverty line, including nearly one in four children. Let that nauseating number soak in - one quarter of kids in the Miami 'Burbclaves growing up impoverished while their neighbors sip MoÃ«t across the venetian waterways.

The disparities are so egregious that the total number of Florida food stamp recipients surpasses the individual populations of 19 different states. We're talking legions of the working poor - home health aides, restaurant staffers, agricultural migrants - toiling constantly yet never escaping the undertow of poverty's merciless grasp.

Meanwhile, our esteemed legislators would sooner umbilical cord a manatee than raise the state minimum wage from its paltry $8.65 level. Sure, why not force hard-working parents into bankruptcy while rewarding yacht owners with yet another tax break to dock their Triple-Decker Hovercraft edition PlaySkiffs? Because, hey, a rising tide raises all triple-deckers or something.

The economic divide has calcified to such an extreme that children raised in Miami's poorest zipcode have a shorter life expectancy than those born in impoverished Bangladesh. Yes, that Bangladesh - with its rivers of sludge and air thicc as pea soup smog. Yet kids from the bottom rungs of "The Magic City" won't survive as long as families living in literal Third World squallor.

Escaping this purgatory requires the Olympic hurdling abilities of a Jamaican track phenom. State policies have erected roadblock after roadblock for the disadvantaged - demonizing folks on public assistance, dismantling affordable housing funds, under-investing in early childhood education and nutrition. It's a perpetual cycle of institutional anchors weighing down entire communities in a generational morass of destitution.

All the while, we subsidize billionaire-owned sports franchises, fast-track luxury housing developments, and lavish tax favors on big businesses - perpetuating a twisted reverse-Robin Hood ethos of robbing from the poor to splurge on the rich. For the unchecked march of wealth concentration shows no signs of abating, with the top 1% of Florida earners pocketing over 35% of the state's entire income pie.

It doesn't take Achilles to see the fatal flaws in such a lopsided arrangement. Unless we implement substantive policies to uplift struggling communities, bolster workforce training programs, and enhance the social safety net, Florida risks transforming into a banana republic of haves and have-nots. A tropical apartheid state where beachside opulence and third-world squalor coexist in perverse dynamic tension.

Of course, meaningful change would require our leaders to possessed functional souls not embalmed by corporate greed and cronyism. Fat chance in today's Griftopian era of pay-to-play politics. About as likely as Jake Paul winning the Nobel Peace Prize or Donald Trump renouncing narcissism.

So for now, the bitter economic gulf separating Florida's landed aristocracy from the huddled masses will only widen and fester. A sprawling sun-baked junkyard where dreams go to die - buried under the detritus of betrayed populist ideals and squandered human potential. A veritable paradise... for the privileged few.
