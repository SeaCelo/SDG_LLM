The Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development presents a comprehensive analysis of the global progress and challenges in achieving Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1): End poverty in all its forms everywhere.

Despite concerted efforts, the scourge of poverty remains a pervasive global issue, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, rising inflation, and escalating conflicts. The latest estimates indicate that 689 million people, or 9.2% of the global population, lived in extreme poverty in 2021, surviving on less than $2.15 a day. This represents an alarming increase of nearly 100 million people since 2019, reversing decades of hard-won progress.

Poverty is a multidimensional phenomenon, extending beyond mere income deprivation. It encompasses inadequate access to education, healthcare, sanitation, and other essential services, perpetuating intergenerational cycles of deprivation and marginalization. Disaggregated data reveal that poverty disproportionately affects certain segments of society, including children, women, persons with disabilities, and marginalized communities.

Alarmingly, the increasing frequency and intensity of climate-related disasters, such as droughts, floods, and extreme weather events, are exacerbating poverty levels, particularly in vulnerable regions like sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. These climate shocks undermine livelihoods, food security, and infrastructure, trapping communities in a vicious cycle of poverty and environmental degradation.

Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on global poverty reduction efforts. Lockdowns, disruptions to supply chains, and economic contractions have resulted in widespread job losses, reduced income, and diminished access to essential services. The consequences have been particularly severe for informal workers, who lack social protection and have limited savings to cushion against such shocks.

Despite these formidable challenges, there are pockets of progress and innovative solutions worth highlighting. The proliferation of digital technologies and mobile money platforms has facilitated financial inclusion, enabling access to credit, savings, and insurance services for the unbanked population. Social protection programs, such as cash transfers and public employment schemes, have proven instrumental in mitigating the immediate impacts of poverty and building resilience.

Collaborative efforts between governments, civil society organizations, and the private sector have yielded promising results in empowering marginalized communities through skills development, entrepreneurship support, and access to productive resources. Initiatives like the Village Savings and Loan Associations (VSLAs) have fostered financial inclusion and economic empowerment, particularly for women in rural areas.

However, progress remains uneven, and significant disparities persist across and within countries. Achieving SDG 1 requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the root causes of poverty, promotes inclusive economic growth, and fosters resilience against shocks and stresses.

Firstly, there is a pressing need for robust and well-targeted social protection systems that provide a safety net for the most vulnerable segments of society. These should be complemented by investments in human capital development, including quality education, healthcare, and skills training, to break the intergenerational transmission of poverty.

Secondly, promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth is paramount. This entails creating decent employment opportunities, fostering entrepreneurship, and ensuring equitable access to productive resources, such as land, credit, and technology. Special attention should be given to marginalized groups, including women, youth, and rural populations, to ensure their full participation in economic activities.

Thirdly, addressing climate change and environmental degradation is crucial for poverty eradication efforts. Investing in climate-resilient infrastructure, promoting sustainable agricultural practices, and fostering community-based adaptation strategies can enhance the resilience of vulnerable populations to environmental shocks.

Fourthly, effective governance, accountability, and institutional capacity are essential for the successful implementation and monitoring of poverty reduction strategies. This includes strengthening data collection and analysis systems to accurately track progress, identify gaps, and inform evidence-based policymaking.

Lastly, increased international cooperation, resource mobilization, and knowledge-sharing are vital for accelerating progress towards SDG 1. Developed nations must honor their commitments to Official Development Assistance (ODA) and innovative financing mechanisms, such as blended finance and impact investing, should be leveraged to catalyze private sector participation.

Achieving SDG 1 is an imperative not only for upholding human dignity and fulfilling the moral obligation to eradicate extreme poverty but also for fostering social cohesion, economic prosperity, and sustainable development. By addressing the multidimensional nature of poverty and adopting a holistic approach that integrates economic, social, and environmental considerations, we can pave the way for a more equitable and prosperous world for all.
