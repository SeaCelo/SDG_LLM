Seva Foundation, an international non-profit organization dedicated to eradicating poverty and fostering sustainable development, presents this analytical report on the current progress and challenges associated with Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1): "End poverty in all its forms everywhere."

Despite concerted efforts by governments, international organizations, and civil society, poverty remains a pervasive and multidimensional challenge globally. While substantial progress has been made in reducing extreme poverty over the past few decades, the COVID-19 pandemic has threatened to reverse these gains, exacerbating existing inequalities and vulnerabilities.

According to the World Bank's latest estimates, the pandemic pushed an additional 119 million to 124 million people into extreme poverty in 2020, living on less than $1.90 per day. This setback has disproportionately impacted marginalized communities, particularly in developing nations, where social safety nets and access to essential services remain inadequate.

Addressing poverty requires a comprehensive approach that encompasses not only income poverty but also multidimensional deprivations in education, health, access to clean water and sanitation, and other critical aspects of human development. The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), developed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI), provides a more holistic understanding of poverty by considering overlapping deprivations.

According to the 2022 MPI report, approximately 1.3 billion people across 109 countries experience multidimensional poverty, with the highest levels concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. The report highlights the interconnected nature of poverty, where deprivations in one dimension often exacerbate challenges in others, creating a vicious cycle that perpetuates intergenerational poverty.

Addressing poverty requires a comprehensive approach that encompasses not only income poverty but also multidimensional deprivations in education, health, access to clean water and sanitation, and other critical aspects of human development.

Seva Foundation's initiatives in rural communities across Asia and Africa have demonstrated the transformative impact of an integrated approach to poverty alleviation. By combining access to education, healthcare, and livelihood opportunities with community-driven development models, we have witnessed remarkable improvements in the well-being and resilience of marginalized populations.

One such example is our flagship program in rural Bangladesh, where we have partnered with local organizations to establish community learning centers, provide vocational training, and facilitate access to microfinance opportunities. This holistic approach has not only empowered individuals economically but also fostered social inclusivity and gender equality, addressing the multidimensional nature of poverty.

However, achieving SDG 1 requires concerted efforts beyond the scope of individual organizations. It necessitates collaborative action from governments, private sector entities, and civil society organizations to address the systemic barriers and structural inequalities that perpetuate poverty.

Governments play a crucial role in developing and implementing inclusive social protection policies, ensuring access to basic services, and creating an enabling environment for sustainable economic growth and decent employment opportunities. Effective governance, transparency, and accountability are pivotal in ensuring that resources and policies reach those most in need.

Furthermore, climate change and environmental degradation pose significant threats to poverty alleviation efforts, disproportionately impacting vulnerable communities reliant on natural resources for their livelihoods. Addressing these interlinked challenges requires a concerted effort to promote sustainable and resilient development pathways, aligning with other Sustainable Development Goals such as SDG 13 (Climate Action) and SDG 15 (Life on Land).

To accelerate progress towards SDG 1, Seva Foundation advocates for a comprehensive and integrated approach that addresses the multidimensional nature of poverty. By fostering cross-sectoral collaborations, promoting inclusive policies, and investing in sustainable development solutions, we can collectively create a world where no one is left behind.
