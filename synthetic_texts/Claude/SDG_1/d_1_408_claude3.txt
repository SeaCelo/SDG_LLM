The Agency of International Cooperation for Development presents a comprehensive analysis of the global progress and challenges surrounding Sustainable Development Goal 1: No Poverty. Eradicating poverty in all its forms remains one of the greatest challenges facing humanity, and a indispensable requirement for sustainable development. 

Despite significant strides in reducing extreme poverty rates globally, with the percentage of people living on less than $1.90 a day declining from 35.9% in 1990 to 9.2% in 2017, substantial disparities persist across regions and demographic groups. Sub-Saharan Africa continues to grapple with alarmingly high poverty levels, with over 40% of the population living below the international poverty line. Moreover, even in regions that have witnessed notable progress, such as East Asia and the Pacific, pockets of entrenched poverty persist, often exacerbated by intersecting vulnerabilities stemming from gender, age, disability, or geographic isolation.

The multidimensional nature of poverty underscores the need for comprehensive and coordinated interventions that transcend income-based metrics. Access to quality education, healthcare, decent work opportunities, and basic infrastructure remain critical determinants of poverty eradication. Regrettably, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these challenges, reversing decades of progress and pushing an estimated 119 to 124 million additional people into extreme poverty in 2020 alone.

Addressing poverty requires a multi-pronged approach that encompasses social protection systems, inclusive economic growth strategies, and targeted investments in human capital development. Robust social safety nets, such as conditional cash transfers, have proven effective in mitigating the immediate impacts of poverty while simultaneously promoting human capital accumulation. However, their long-term sustainability and scalability remain contingent upon fiscal space and governance structures.

Fostering inclusive economic growth is pivotal to creating decent job opportunities and promoting economic mobility. This necessitates structural transformations that diversify economies, enhance productivity, and facilitate the transition to higher-value-added sectors. Investing in agriculture, rural development, and urbanization policies that promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization is crucial, particularly in regions where a significant proportion of the population depends on agriculture for their livelihoods.

Addressing gender inequalities and empowering women and girls is a critical cross-cutting strategy for poverty reduction. Women and girls disproportionately bear the brunt of poverty, facing systemic barriers to education, economic opportunities, and decision-making processes. Ensuring equal access to productive resources, financial services, and legal protections can unlock significant economic and social gains, fostering intergenerational poverty alleviation.

Climate change and environmental degradation pose significant threats to poverty eradication efforts, disproportionately impacting the most vulnerable communities. Integrating climate resilience and sustainable natural resource management into poverty reduction strategies is imperative to safeguard hard-won gains and ensure long-term sustainability.

Achieving SDG 1 requires a concerted global effort that mobilizes resources, fosters multi-stakeholder partnerships, and promotes policy coherence across sectors and levels of governance. Innovative financing mechanisms, such as blended finance and impact investing, can catalyze private sector engagement and unlock additional resources for poverty reduction initiatives.

In conclusion, eradicating poverty in all its forms is an ambitious yet attainable goal that demands sustained political commitment, coordinated action, and a unwavering dedication to leaving no one behind. By addressing the root causes of poverty through inclusive and transformative policies, we can pave the way for a more equitable, sustainable, and prosperous future for all.
