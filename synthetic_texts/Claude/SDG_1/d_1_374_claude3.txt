In line with our commitment to eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) has undertaken a comprehensive analysis of the current state of Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1) – No Poverty. Our findings reveal a complex and multifaceted challenge that requires a holistic and multidimensional approach, taking into account the intricate interplay between economic, social, and environmental factors.

Despite the remarkable progress made in reducing global poverty over the past decades, the COVID-19 pandemic has dealt a severe blow to these efforts, reversing years of hard-won gains. According to our estimates, the pandemic has pushed an additional 119 to 124 million people into extreme poverty in 2020, exacerbating existing vulnerabilities and exposing the fragility of many economies, particularly in the developing world.

This setback underscores the urgency of accelerating our collective efforts to address the root causes of poverty, which extend far beyond the traditional focus on income and consumption. Our analysis highlights the critical role of inclusive and sustainable economic growth, which must be underpinned by robust social protection systems, equitable access to essential services, and resilient infrastructure.

In this context, we have identified several key areas that demand immediate attention and concerted action from both the IsDB and its member countries.

Firstly, promoting inclusive and pro-poor growth remains a paramount objective. This requires a comprehensive strategy that fosters economic diversification, encourages private sector development, and creates decent employment opportunities, particularly for marginalized groups such as women, youth, and those living in rural areas. Investing in human capital through quality education, vocational training, and capacity building initiatives is crucial to equipping individuals with the skills and knowledge necessary to participate in and benefit from economic growth.

Secondly, strengthening social protection systems is essential to safeguarding the most vulnerable segments of society from economic shocks and ensuring a basic standard of living. Our analysis highlights the need for comprehensive and well-targeted social safety nets, including cash transfer programs, employment guarantee schemes, and access to affordable healthcare and education. Leveraging innovative financing mechanisms and digital technologies can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of these systems.

Thirdly, addressing the multidimensional nature of poverty necessitates a concerted effort to promote sustainable and resilient infrastructure. This encompasses not only physical infrastructure, such as transportation networks, energy systems, and water and sanitation facilities, but also digital infrastructure that enables access to information, communication, and financial services. Investing in climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable infrastructure is particularly crucial, as the impacts of climate change disproportionately affect the poorest and most vulnerable populations.

Furthermore, our analysis underscores the importance of promoting peaceful and inclusive societies, as conflict, violence, and instability are both drivers and consequences of poverty. Strengthening governance frameworks, promoting the rule of law, and fostering social cohesion are essential to creating an enabling environment for sustainable development and poverty eradication.

Finally, we recognize the critical role of partnerships and international cooperation in achieving SDG 1. No single entity or country can tackle this global challenge alone. By leveraging the collective resources, expertise, and knowledge of various stakeholders – including governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector – we can amplify our impact and accelerate progress toward eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions.

In conclusion, the path to achieving SDG 1 is complex and multifaceted, requiring a holistic and integrated approach that addresses the interrelated economic, social, and environmental dimensions of poverty. The Islamic Development Bank remains steadfast in its commitment to supporting its member countries in their efforts to eradicate poverty and promote sustainable and inclusive development, guided by the principles of Islamic finance and the overarching vision of shared prosperity and human dignity for all.
