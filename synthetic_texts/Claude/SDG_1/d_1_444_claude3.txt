As Street Kids International, an organization dedicated to empowering marginalized youth worldwide, we find the Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1) – "End poverty in all its forms everywhere" – to be a profound and multifaceted challenge that demands our unwavering commitment and innovative approaches.

Poverty is a complex and multidimensional phenomenon, deeply rooted in systemic inequalities, social exclusion, and limited access to resources and opportunities. While progress has been made in reducing extreme poverty globally, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing vulnerabilities, pushing millions more into destitution and reversing hard-won gains. It is estimated that by 2030, over 7% of the world's population will still be living in extreme poverty, underscoring the urgency of our mission.

Our work with street-connected youth has provided us with a unique perspective on the intergenerational cycle of poverty and its devastating consequences. These young individuals, often forced to fend for themselves from an early age, face a myriad of challenges, including lack of access to education, healthcare, and stable employment opportunities. Their circumstances are further compounded by social stigma, exploitation, and human rights violations, trapping them in a vicious cycle of deprivation and marginalization.

Addressing poverty requires a holistic and intersectional approach that tackles its root causes and recognizes the interplay between economic, social, and environmental factors. We believe that empowering street-connected youth through comprehensive interventions is a powerful catalyst for breaking the cycle of poverty and fostering sustainable development.

Our initiatives encompass a range of strategies, including:

1. Inclusive and Quality Education: We prioritize providing street-connected youth with access to formal and non-formal education, recognizing it as a fundamental tool for social mobility and economic empowerment. Our educational programs not only impart academic knowledge but also equip young people with life skills, vocational training, and entrepreneurial guidance, enabling them to secure sustainable livelihoods.

2. Health and Well-being: Poverty and poor health are inextricably linked, with marginalized communities bearing a disproportionate burden of diseases and limited access to healthcare services. Our holistic approach addresses the physical, mental, and emotional well-being of street-connected youth through comprehensive healthcare services, counseling, and support networks, ensuring they can thrive and reach their full potential.

3. Economic Empowerment and Decent Work: Breaking the cycle of poverty requires creating sustainable economic opportunities for youth. We collaborate with local businesses, governments, and civil society organizations to facilitate job placements, entrepreneurship initiatives, and skill-building programs that enhance employability and promote decent work conditions for street-connected youth.

4. Social Protection and Inclusion: Street-connected youth often lack access to essential social services and face discrimination and marginalization. We advocate for their rights, raise awareness about their challenges, and work towards creating an inclusive and equitable society where they can participate fully and contribute to sustainable development.

5. Partnerships and Collaborations: Recognizing the multidimensional nature of poverty, we actively foster partnerships with diverse stakeholders, including governments, international organizations, civil society groups, and the private sector. These collaborations enable us to leverage collective expertise, resources, and innovative solutions to address the complex challenges faced by street-connected youth and their communities.

Our approach is grounded in the principles of youth empowerment, community participation, and evidence-based interventions. We actively engage street-connected youth in the design, implementation, and evaluation of our programs, ensuring their voices are heard and their unique perspectives inform our strategies.

Furthermore, we prioritize continuous research and data collection to track our progress, identify gaps, and adapt our interventions to address emerging challenges. By integrating robust monitoring and evaluation frameworks, we strive to enhance the effectiveness and sustainability of our efforts, contributing to the global knowledge base on poverty alleviation and youth empowerment.

As we navigate the complexities of SDG 1, we remain steadfast in our commitment to leaving no one behind. We recognize that ending poverty requires a concerted global effort and a fundamental shift in societal attitudes and systems. By empowering street-connected youth, we not only transform individual lives but also contribute to the broader goal of building resilient and inclusive communities, where every individual has the opportunity to thrive and shape a more prosperous and equitable future for all.
