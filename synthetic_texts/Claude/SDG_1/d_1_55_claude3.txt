Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 1 (No Poverty), written from the perspective of Bjørn Lomborg:

Among the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations in 2015, the first goal of "No Poverty" represents one of the most ambitious—and controversial—targets. While the moral imperative to eradicate extreme poverty is unassailable, the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of the prescribed strategies remain highly contentious. My analysis suggests that the current framing of SDG 1 is overly simplistic, ideologically driven, and disconnected from empirical evidence on optimal poverty alleviation policies.

The first flaw is the delineation of the $1.90/day threshold for extreme poverty, which fails to account for national and regional disparities in purchasing power and living costs. A more nuanced, relative measure is required. Moreover, reducing poverty through indiscriminate cash transfers or ramping up foreign aid is demonstrably inefficient, breeding dependency rather than fostering self-sufficiency.

Instead, we ought to prioritize catalysts for long-term economic growth and human capital accumulation, as substantiated by decades of empirical development research. Investments in market reforms, property rights, trade liberalization, and quality education consistently deliver higher returns than top-down wealth redistribution. China's rapid poverty reduction since embracing market policies exemplifies this dynamic.

SDG 1's Target 1.4 rightly emphasizes equal access to economic resources and basic services. However, many proposed interventions like formalized social protection systems are prohibitively expensive for developing nations and create perverse incentives undermining labor participation. Smarter solutions like user-paid community services and safety nets conditional on work requirements are more fiscally sustainable.

Similarly, Target 1.5 advocates building resilience to environmental shocks—an admirable goal in isolation. But the prescribed "climate action" policies like emissions reductions and renewable energy subsidies deliver minuscule benefits at astronomical costs that could be better allocated to tangible poverty alleviation measures like disease prevention or nutrient provision.

The path to poverty eradication lies not in utopian ideals but in pragmatic, evidence-based policies focused on stimulating sustained economic growth and productivity improvements. This means ardently defending free markets, property rights, free trade, and technological progress while directly addressing developing nations' most binding constraints to growth like disease, malnutrition, lack of infrastructure, and low human capital.

For far too long, a romantic yet empirically unfounded narrative has persisted that indiscriminate wealth redistribution and climate policies can solve poverty. The reality is far more nuanced—targeted investments in growth enablers and grassroots entrepreneurship offer a far higher return on investment for the global poor. SDG 1 should be reframed accordingly.
