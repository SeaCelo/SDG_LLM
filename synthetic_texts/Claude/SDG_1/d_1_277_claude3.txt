Here is a detailed academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 1 (No Poverty), written from the perspective of Luigi Zingales, an Italian economist known for his research on corporate governance and capitalism:

Poverty is both a cause and consequence of the breakdown of economic and political institutions that enable human flourishing. While the world has made significant strides in reducing extreme poverty over the past few decades, far too many people still lack access to basic economic opportunities and face systemic barriers that trap them in intergenerational cycles of deprivation. 

Fundamentally, poverty is an issue of asymmetric power and lack of economic freedom. Those born into poverty often face depleted access to quality education, healthcare, job opportunities, and basic public services and utilities. This lack of human capital investment perpetuates their disadvantages, while concentrations of wealth and cronyism further rig the system against their upward mobility.

The traditional approaches of wealth redistribution and social safety nets, while providing vital stopgaps, are insufficient for tackling poverty's root causes. True poverty alleviation requires dismantling the elite capture of political and economic institutions that preserve insider advantages. We must promote inclusive, transparent governance that empowers participation and equalizes access to public resources, services, and economic rights like property ownership.

Regulatory reforms that lower barriers to entrepreneurship and labor mobility are critical for enabling the creative destruction that challenges entrenched incumbents and monopolistic practices. Secure property rights encourage investment, while competitive markets discipline firms to create value rather than extracting rents. Eliminating corruption is paramount for restoring public trust and enabling genuine equal opportunity.

Education is the ultimate key that unlocks human potential. Tragically, the poor consistently receive substandard education that reinforces generational disadvantages. We need a moral re-centering that treats quality education as the highest societal priority, coupled with innovative models like vouchers and charter schools that introduce competitive pressures. Curriculums must equip students with critical thinking abilities rather than rote skills training.

Ultimately, poverty persists because of institutional failures that concentrate power and economic freedom in the hands of a rent-seeking minority. Breaking these cycles requires bold steps to diffuse economic influence, decentralize decision-making, and empower the participation of the marginalized in shaping the rules that govern their lives. Only then can we create a truly level playing field for prosperity.
