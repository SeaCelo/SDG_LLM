The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) is a specialized agency of the United Nations dedicated to eradicating rural poverty and fostering sustainable agricultural development. In this report, we critically examine SDG 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere, with a particular focus on its relevance to our mandate and the intricate interplay between poverty, food security, and sustainable rural development.

Poverty is a multidimensional issue that extends beyond mere income deprivation, encompassing limited access to essential services, inadequate nutrition, poor health outcomes, and restricted opportunities. This reality is particularly pronounced in rural areas, where a disproportionate share of the world's poorest populations reside. Smallholder farmers, pastoralists, and other rural dwellers face a myriad of challenges, including limited access to productive resources, vulnerability to climate shocks, and exclusion from economic opportunities.

Addressing rural poverty is fundamental to achieving SDG 1, as it directly impacts the ability of individuals and communities to break the vicious cycle of deprivation. IFAD recognizes that sustainable agricultural development is a powerful catalyst for poverty reduction and shared prosperity. By investing in smallholder agriculture, we empower rural communities to increase their productivity, enhance their resilience, and generate sustainable income streams.

One of our flagship initiatives is the Adaptation for Smallholder Agriculture Programme (ASAP), which supports smallholder farmers in adapting to the impacts of climate change. Through interventions such as improved water management, diversified crop production, and access to climate-resilient technologies, ASAP helps to mitigate the risks posed by environmental shocks, ensuring food security and safeguarding livelihoods.

IFAD's efforts are not limited to direct agricultural interventions; we also prioritize the development of inclusive rural economies. By fostering public-private partnerships, facilitating access to financial services, and promoting rural entrepreneurship, we create opportunities for non-farm employment and income diversification. This holistic approach recognizes the interconnected nature of SDGs, as progress in poverty reduction (SDG 1) is inextricably linked to food security (SDG 2), gender equality (SDG 5), and decent work and economic growth (SDG 8).

Furthermore, IFAD's interventions are underpinned by a commitment to environmental sustainability, aligning with SDG 13 (Climate Action) and SDG 15 (Life on Land). Our projects promote sustainable land management practices, biodiversity conservation, and the adoption of renewable energy sources, ensuring that poverty reduction efforts do not come at the expense of environmental degradation.

While progress has been made, significant challenges persist. Conflict, political instability, and weak governance structures can hinder the effective implementation of poverty reduction strategies. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing vulnerabilities, threatening to reverse hard-won gains and push millions back into poverty.

To address these challenges, IFAD advocates for a coordinated global effort that brings together diverse stakeholders, including governments, civil society organizations, the private sector, and international development partners. By leveraging our collective resources, expertise, and innovative solutions, we can accelerate progress towards SDG 1 and create a more equitable and sustainable world for all.
