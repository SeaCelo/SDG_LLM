Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 1 (No Poverty), written from the perspective of Gail Collins, the American journalist and op-ed columnist:

The Enduring Struggle Against Poverty: A Moral Imperative for Our Time 

By Gail Collins

Let's start with a discomfiting fact - in this modern era of mind-bending technological marvels and unprecedented material wealth, nearly half the world's population still subsists on less than $5.50 per day. Ponder that for a moment. While we tap away on our smartphones and binge the latest Netflix series, almost 3.4 billion human beings endure a daily struggle to secure basic necessities like food, clean water, and shelter.  

This stubborn persistence of grinding poverty amidst society's brightest achievements is more than an economic failure - it's a moral failing that indicts us all. How can we call ourselves a truly civilized species when the marginalized eke out an existence on the fringes, largely unseen and unheard by those of us cocooned in comfort?

The United Nations' first Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty in all its forms everywhere by 2030 is both breathtakingly ambitious and morally urgent. Poverty is not merely a lack of income - it's a rupture in human dignity that perpetuates a vicious cycle of deprivation, undermining health, education, and the ability to participate meaningfully in society.  

For impoverished children, poverty is a soul-crushing inheritance that constrains opportunity from birth. In developing nations, one in five kids is malnourished, while around the world 385 million urchins labor in unconscionable conditions - modern-day Dickensian nightmares made real. Lacking access to quality education, generation after generation remains trapped, economic mobility a mere fantasy.

For adults consigned to subsistence through ill-health, conflict, or sheer geographic misfortune of being born in a resource-poor region, poverty is a relentless grind that grinds down body and spirit. Social safety nets we take for granted are non-existent. Devastating setbacks like a medical emergency or natural disaster can quickly plunge a family over the precipice from poverty into destitution and hunger.  

And make no mistake - poverty disproportionately impacts women, who routinely confront gender discrimination, exploitation, and diminished access to economic resources. This entrenched bias feeds into cycles of marginalization that pass from mother to daughter across generations. 

Even as globalization and economic growth have lifted over a billion people from extreme poverty since 1990, we've seen rising inequality and a concentration of wealth and power among corporate titans and the global elite. While Bono choruses "A man can be as great as he wants to be," the blunt truth is that arbitrary circumstances like birthplace, gender, and systemic injustices often seal fates.  

And all our interconnected challenges - health pandemics, climate change, violent conflicts - both stem from and perpetuate impoverished conditions. What future can we hope to build atop the flimsy foundation of a profoundly unequal world? Social injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.

Breaking this cycle demands we rethink our societal values and economic models with an honest focus on equitable, inclusive, and sustainable development. It calls for a holistic commitment to quality education, universal health care, decent jobs, social protections, and economic empowerment of women. It necessitates investment in resilient infrastructure, clean energy access, dynamic rural economies, and innovative technological solutions tailored to local contexts.

Most critically, it obliges those of us insulated from deprivation to bear witness and raise our moral voices. Outrage and disillusionment are understandable face to this enduring global injustice. But we must not resign ourselves to poverty's inevitability. Across borders and differences, our common human dignity binds us. Transformative change remains possible, but only if we find the resolve to make it so.

In this turbulent era of accelerating change, we have an opportunity to build a more just and equitable world. The question facing us is stark: Will we rise to fulfill that moral test of our time?
