The eradication of poverty in all its forms remains an elusive global challenge, despite concerted efforts by policymakers, international organizations, and development agencies. Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1), "End poverty in all its forms everywhere," represents a pivotal commitment of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, aiming to address the multidimensional complexities of poverty and foster inclusive economic growth.

Econometric modeling and analysis have played a crucial role in informing strategies and policies designed to combat poverty. Poverty dynamics are inherently complex, characterized by interdependencies and feedback loops across various socioeconomic factors. Consequently, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms and drivers of poverty is imperative for designing effective interventions.

One prominent strand of econometric research has focused on the measurement and decomposition of poverty. Foster-Greer-Thorbecke (FGT) indices, initially proposed by Foster et al. (1984), have emerged as a widely adopted tool for quantifying poverty levels and assessing the depth and severity of deprivation. These indices have facilitated cross-country comparisons and enabled policymakers to gauge the effectiveness of poverty alleviation programs over time.

However, poverty is a multidimensional phenomenon, extending beyond income deprivation to encompass inadequate access to essential services, education, healthcare, and infrastructure. Alkire and Foster's (2011) Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) has gained traction as a complementary measure, capturing the overlapping deprivations faced by individuals and households. Econometric techniques, such as multiple regression analysis and structural equation modeling, have been employed to disentangle the intricate relationships between various dimensions of poverty and their determinants.

Addressing poverty requires a comprehensive understanding of its underlying drivers and determinants. Econometric analyses have shed light on the complex interplay between macroeconomic factors, demographic shifts, education attainment, access to financial services, and poverty dynamics. For instance, panel data models and instrumental variable approaches have been employed to investigate the causal effects of economic growth, income inequality, and fiscal policies on poverty reduction (Ravallion and Chen, 1997; Fosu, 2017).

Furthermore, econometric techniques have been instrumental in evaluating the impact of targeted poverty alleviation programs and social protection initiatives. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental methods, such as difference-in-differences and propensity score matching, have gained prominence in assessing the effectiveness of interventions, such as conditional cash transfers, microfinance initiatives, and employment guarantee schemes (Banerjee et al., 2015; Gertler et al., 2012).

Spatial econometrics has also emerged as a valuable tool for understanding the spatial dynamics of poverty and identifying geographical clusters of deprivation. Spatial autoregressive models and geographically weighted regressions have enabled researchers to capture spatial dependence and heterogeneity, shedding light on the role of regional disparities, agglomeration effects, and neighborhood spillovers in perpetuating or alleviating poverty (Stakhovych and Bijmolt, 2009; Jalan and Ravallion, 2002).

As we progress towards the 2030 target for SDG 1, econometric analyses will continue to play a pivotal role in guiding evidence-based policymaking and informing strategies for inclusive growth and poverty eradication. However, the inherent complexities and context-specific nature of poverty underscore the need for interdisciplinary collaborations and the integration of econometric insights with qualitative and participatory approaches.

Moreover, the availability and quality of data remain critical challenges, particularly in developing economies where poverty is most pervasive. Advancements in data collection techniques, such as high-frequency monitoring systems and innovative survey methods, coupled with the growing availability of big data sources, hold promise for enhancing the accuracy and granularity of econometric analyses.

In conclusion, econometric modeling and analysis have made substantial contributions to our understanding of poverty dynamics and the design of effective interventions. As the global community strives to achieve SDG 1, the application of cutting-edge econometric techniques, coupled with interdisciplinary collaborations and data advancements, will be instrumental in informing targeted policies, monitoring progress, and facilitating evidence-based decision-making for sustainable poverty eradication.
