CARE is pleased to present this comprehensive analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 1: No Poverty. As a leading humanitarian organization dedicated to ending global poverty and promoting social justice, we have a deep understanding of the multidimensional challenges and complex interconnections associated with this crucial goal.

Eradicating poverty in all its forms remains one of the greatest challenges facing humanity. Despite significant progress over the past decades, an estimated 689 million people worldwide still live in extreme poverty, subsisting on less than $1.90 per day. Poverty is not merely a lack of income, but a deprivation of basic human rights and dignity, including access to healthcare, education, clean water, and adequate nutrition. It is a vicious cycle that perpetuates itself across generations, with those born into poverty facing immense obstacles to escaping its grip.

The global COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the poverty crisis, pushing an additional 97 million people into extreme poverty in 2020 alone. The economic downturn, coupled with disruptions in essential services and social safety nets, has disproportionately impacted the most vulnerable populations, including women, children, and marginalized communities. In many developing countries, the pandemic has undone years of hard-won progress, threatening to reverse decades of poverty reduction efforts.

Addressing poverty requires a multifaceted and holistic approach that addresses its root causes and systemic barriers. One of the most effective strategies is empowering women and girls, who often bear the brunt of poverty's consequences. Investing in their education, access to healthcare, and economic opportunities has proven to be a catalyst for breaking the cycle of poverty, as empowered women reinvest their gains into their families and communities.

In rural regions of Sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, CARE has implemented initiatives to provide women with access to microfinance services, agricultural training, and market linkages. By equipping them with the tools and resources to become economically self-sufficient, these programs have not only increased household incomes but also improved food security, health outcomes, and educational attainment for children.

Furthermore, addressing poverty requires a concerted effort to build resilient and sustainable livelihoods, particularly in regions vulnerable to climate change and natural disasters. CARE's Village Savings and Loan Association (VSLA) model has proven effective in empowering communities to build financial resilience and cope with economic shocks. By pooling their savings and providing access to small loans, VSLAs have enabled families to invest in income-generating activities, mitigate risk, and build assets, ultimately breaking the cycle of intergenerational poverty.

Achieving SDG 1 is inextricably linked to progress on other Sustainable Development Goals, such as SDG 2: Zero Hunger, SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being, SDG 4: Quality Education, and SDG 5: Gender Equality. Poverty perpetuates food insecurity, poor health outcomes, lack of access to education, and gender inequality, while progress in these areas can alleviate poverty's grip. Conversely, poverty hinders progress on SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation, SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy, and SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth, creating a vicious cycle that must be addressed holistically.

Achieving SDG 1 requires a concerted effort from all stakeholders, including governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector. Governments must prioritize pro-poor policies, invest in social protection systems, and create enabling environments for inclusive economic growth. International organizations must mobilize resources, share knowledge, and coordinate efforts to maximize impact. Civil society organizations, like CARE, play a crucial role in advocating for the rights of the poor, implementing grassroots initiatives, and amplifying the voices of marginalized communities. The private sector can contribute through responsible business practices, inclusive value chains, and innovative solutions that create economic opportunities for the poor.

As we approach the 2030 deadline for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, it is imperative that we redouble our efforts to eradicate poverty in all its forms. Failure to do so would not only undermine progress on the other SDGs but also threaten global peace, stability, and prosperity. By addressing poverty's root causes, empowering vulnerable populations, and fostering inclusive economic growth, we can build a more just and equitable world, where every human being has the opportunity to live a dignified life free from the shackles of poverty.
