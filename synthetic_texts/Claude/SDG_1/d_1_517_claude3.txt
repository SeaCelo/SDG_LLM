Eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions remains one of the greatest challenges of our time, with profound implications for strategic management theory and practice. The first Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 1) – "End poverty in all its forms everywhere" – is a rallying call for concerted global action, and its significance extends far beyond the realm of international development and philanthropy.

Through the lens of strategic management, SDG 1 represents a multi-faceted opportunity and imperative. On one hand, it presents firms with a vast, untapped market of billions of potential consumers at the base of the economic pyramid. Strategically engaging with this underserved segment can unlock new pathways for inclusive growth, innovation, and long-term value creation. On the other hand, the enduring presence of poverty poses systemic risks to businesses, threatening the stability of their operations, supply chains, and customer bases. Proactive engagement with SDG 1 is thus a matter of enlightened self-interest, mitigating exogenous shocks and safeguarding the long-term viability of business models.

From a theoretical standpoint, the complexities of poverty alleviation challenge conventional strategic management paradigms. The traditional focus on profit maximization and shareholder primacy is increasingly untenable in the face of mounting societal pressures and the recognition that long-term business success is inextricably linked to the well-being of communities and the natural environment. SDG 1 necessitates a fundamental rethinking of the firm's raison d'être, redefining the boundaries of value creation and stakeholder engagement.

This shift aligns with emerging perspectives in strategic management, such as the shared value framework (Porter & Kramer, 2011) and the notion of creating sustainable competitive advantage through corporate social responsibility (Surroca et al., 2010). These theories posit that addressing societal challenges, including poverty, can be a source of innovation, differentiation, and long-term profitability. By integrating poverty alleviation into their core business strategies, firms can simultaneously generate economic value and positive social impact, transcending the outdated trade-off mentality between financial performance and societal well-being.

Empirical evidence supports this view, with numerous case studies demonstrating the potential for profitable business models that address the needs of low-income communities. For instance, multinational corporations like Unilever and Danone have successfully launched affordable, nutrition-rich product lines tailored for the bottom of the pyramid, while social enterprises like Grameen Bank and Barefoot College have pioneered innovative approaches to financial inclusion and renewable energy access, respectively.

However, realizing the strategic potential of SDG 1 is not without challenges. The multi-dimensional nature of poverty, encompassing income, health, education, and access to basic services, requires a holistic and contextually nuanced approach. Firms must navigate complex institutional landscapes, regulatory environments, and cultural dynamics, often in regions with limited infrastructure and weak governance structures. Effective cross-sector collaboration with governments, non-governmental organizations, and local communities is crucial, necessitating new forms of stakeholder engagement and value co-creation.

Furthermore, the issue of scale and sustainability looms large. While numerous pilot projects and localized initiatives have demonstrated promise, scaling and replicating these models across diverse geographies and socio-economic contexts remains a formidable challenge. Long-term commitment, patient capital, and innovative financing mechanisms are essential to overcome the inherent risks and uncertainties associated with serving low-income markets.

In light of these complexities, strategic management scholars have a pivotal role to play in advancing the discourse on SDG 1 and poverty alleviation. Integrating insights from diverse disciplines, such as development economics, anthropology, and social entrepreneurship, can enrich strategic management theory and provide a more nuanced understanding of the societal embeddedness of firms. Rigorous empirical research is needed to elucidate the drivers of successful poverty alleviation strategies, the mechanisms through which they create shared value, and the capabilities required to implement them effectively.

Moreover, strategic management research can contribute to the development of new frameworks and tools for measuring and evaluating the multidimensional impacts of business activities on poverty reduction. Traditional financial metrics and accounting systems are ill-equipped to capture the full spectrum of societal and environmental externalities, hindering informed decision-making and resource allocation. Interdisciplinary collaborations with experts in impact assessment, data analytics, and systems thinking can yield novel methodologies for quantifying and optimizing the poverty alleviation outcomes of business strategies.

In conclusion, SDG 1 represents a profound challenge and opportunity for strategic management theory and practice. By embracing poverty alleviation as a core strategic imperative, firms can unlock new sources of value creation, mitigate systemic risks, and contribute to the collective effort towards a more equitable and sustainable global economy. Strategic management scholars have a critical role to play in advancing this agenda, integrating diverse perspectives, generating actionable insights, and fostering cross-sector collaboration. The eradication of poverty is not merely a moral imperative but a strategic necessity for long-term business success and societal prosperity.
