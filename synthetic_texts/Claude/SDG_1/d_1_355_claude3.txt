The African Development Bank recognizes the critical importance of eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions as a fundamental prerequisite for sustainable development on the African continent. Addressing Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1) – No Poverty – remains a pressing challenge that demands concerted efforts and innovative approaches.

Despite significant progress in recent decades, an alarming proportion of Africa's population continues to live in extreme poverty, with multidimensional deprivations that extend beyond income poverty. This reality is exacerbated by a range of interconnected factors, including climate change, conflicts, and economic instability, which disproportionately affect the most vulnerable populations, particularly women, children, and marginalized communities.

Tackling poverty in Africa requires a holistic and multifaceted strategy that addresses the structural drivers of poverty, empowers individuals and communities, and fosters inclusive and sustainable economic growth. In this regard, the African Development Bank has adopted a comprehensive framework that encompasses social protection programs, access to basic services, productive employment opportunities, and resilience-building initiatives.

Social protection systems play a crucial role in mitigating the impacts of poverty and fostering human capital development. The Bank has supported several countries in establishing and strengthening social safety nets, such as cash transfer programs, which have proven effective in reducing poverty and improving access to education, health, and nutrition services. However, ensuring the long-term sustainability and adequate coverage of these programs remains a challenge, requiring innovative financing mechanisms and robust monitoring and evaluation systems.

Access to quality basic services, including education, healthcare, clean water, and sanitation, is a fundamental human right and a prerequisite for breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty. The Bank has invested in infrastructure development, capacity building, and policy reforms to enhance access to these services, particularly in rural and remote areas. Initiatives such as the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative (RWSSI) have made significant strides in improving access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities, contributing to improved health outcomes and economic productivity.

Promoting productive employment and decent work opportunities is central to the Bank's poverty eradication efforts. The Bank has supported job creation through investments in key economic sectors, such as agriculture, manufacturing, and infrastructure development. Additionally, the Bank has prioritized entrepreneurship and skills development programs, particularly for youth and women, to equip them with the necessary tools and resources to participate in the formal economy and generate sustainable incomes.

Building resilience to shocks and stresses is crucial for safeguarding hard-won development gains and preventing vulnerable populations from falling back into poverty. The Bank has supported climate-resilient infrastructure projects, disaster risk management initiatives, and livelihood diversification programs to enhance the adaptive capacity of communities and reduce their vulnerability to natural disasters, climate change, and economic shocks.

To ensure the effectiveness and sustainability of these interventions, the African Development Bank has placed a strong emphasis on policy reforms, institutional capacity building, and good governance. By strengthening public financial management systems, enhancing transparency and accountability mechanisms, and fostering an enabling environment for private sector development, the Bank aims to create an ecosystem conducive to inclusive and sustainable economic growth.

Partnerships and collaborations with various stakeholders, including governments, civil society organizations, and the private sector, are essential for leveraging resources, sharing knowledge, and maximizing impact. The Bank has actively engaged in multi-stakeholder platforms and initiatives, such as the African Leaders for Nutrition (ALN) and the African Risk Capacity (ARC), to foster coordinated efforts and collective action towards poverty eradication.

Despite the significant progress made, challenges persist, and the path towards achieving SDG 1 in Africa remains arduous. Persistent conflicts, climate change, and the COVID-19 pandemic have exacerbated existing vulnerabilities and reversed hard-won development gains. However, the African Development Bank remains steadfast in its commitment to eradicating poverty and fostering inclusive and sustainable development on the continent, guided by the principles of innovation, resilience, and partnership.
