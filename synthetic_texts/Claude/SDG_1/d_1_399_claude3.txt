BRAC, as a leading development organization, presents this analytical report on the progress and challenges associated with Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1): "End poverty in all its forms everywhere." Despite global efforts, poverty remains a pervasive issue, and its eradication requires a multifaceted approach that addresses its root causes and manifestations.

Poverty is a multidimensional phenomenon that extends beyond the traditional measure of income poverty. It encompasses deprivations in access to education, healthcare, clean water, sanitation, and other essential services, exacerbating social and economic inequalities. BRAC's ground-level interventions have highlighted the intricate interplay between poverty, gender disparities, and environmental degradation, necessitating a holistic approach to address these interconnected challenges.

While significant progress has been made in reducing extreme poverty globally, with the percentage of people living on less than $1.90 a day decreasing from 36% in 1990 to 9.2% in 2017, the COVID-19 pandemic has reversed many of these gains. The economic downturn and disruptions to global supply chains have pushed an additional 119 to 124 million people into extreme poverty in 2020, according to World Bank estimates. BRAC's field operations have witnessed firsthand the devastating impacts of the pandemic on vulnerable populations, particularly in rural areas where social safety nets are inadequate.

Addressing poverty requires a comprehensive approach that tackles its root causes, such as lack of access to quality education, healthcare, and economic opportunities. BRAC's flagship programs in education, healthcare, and microfinance have demonstrated the transformative power of empowering individuals and communities through targeted interventions. For instance, BRAC's non-formal primary education program has enabled millions of children, particularly from marginalized communities, to access quality education, breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty.

However, poverty alleviation efforts must also address the broader structural barriers that perpetuate inequality and marginalization. BRAC's advocacy efforts have focused on promoting inclusive policies and governance structures that prioritize the needs of the poor and vulnerable. This includes advocating for social protection programs, fair labor practices, and access to productive resources such as land and credit.

Furthermore, BRAC recognizes the inextricable link between poverty and environmental degradation. Climate change and natural disasters disproportionately impact the poor, who often lack the resources and resilience to cope with these shocks. BRAC's climate-adaptive agriculture programs and disaster risk reduction initiatives have empowered communities to adopt sustainable practices and build resilience against environmental threats, safeguarding their livelihoods and food security.

Achieving SDG 1 requires a collaborative effort involving governments, civil society organizations, private sector entities, and local communities. BRAC's strengths lie in its ability to leverage its extensive grassroots presence, community trust, and innovative approaches to catalyze sustainable change. However, sustained political commitment, adequate funding, and effective partnerships are crucial for scaling up successful interventions and ensuring no one is left behind.

In conclusion, eradicating poverty in all its forms is a complex challenge that requires a comprehensive and multidimensional approach. BRAC's experience underscores the importance of addressing the root causes of poverty, empowering individuals and communities, promoting inclusive policies, and fostering resilience against environmental threats. While progress has been made, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the fragility of these gains and the need for redoubled efforts. By leveraging its expertise, innovative solutions, and collaborative partnerships, BRAC remains committed to contributing to the achievement of SDG 1 and ensuring a more equitable and sustainable future for all.
