Dear Reader,

As part of the Italian Development Cooperation Program, it is crucial to address the challenge of eradicating poverty in all its forms and wherever it manifests, as outlined by Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1). Our strategic vision is based on a multidimensional approach that considers the complexity of poverty and its multiple causes.

A key aspect of our commitment is the implementation of universal, adequate, and sustainable social protection systems. This entails creating financial safety nets and providing essential services such as access to education, healthcare, and basic medical assistance. These systems must be designed to meet the specific needs of vulnerable groups, such as women, children, the elderly, and persons with disabilities.

At the same time, we are working to promote economic and social inclusion by facilitating access to productive resources and financial services. This involves investing in rural infrastructure, sustainable agricultural technologies, and microcredit and microfinance programs. The goal is to enable disadvantaged communities to develop their entrepreneurial skills and sustainably generate income.

Another fundamental pillar of our approach is resilience to natural disasters and climate change. We are working to strengthen communities' capacity to prevent, mitigate, and respond to environmental and climatic shocks through land-use planning, disaster risk management, and the implementation of climate adaptation measures.

Furthermore, we are addressing the root causes of poverty, such as inequality and social exclusion. This includes promoting gender equality, empowering women and girls, and combating discrimination and gender-based violence. We are also working to ensure equitable access to resources and services for marginalized communities and to foster social inclusion and cohesion.

A key aspect of our engagement is strengthening institutional capacities and promoting effective policies and programs for poverty reduction. This requires the involvement of all levels of governance, from central government to local authorities, and collaboration with civil society organizations and the private sector.

Finally, we are working to foster an environment conducive to sustainable development through the promotion of good governance, transparency, and accountability. This includes combating corruption, strengthening the rule of law, and promoting efficient and transparent institutions.

Through this holistic and multidimensional approach, we aim to create a lasting impact in the fight against poverty, ensuring that no one is left behind on the path toward sustainable and inclusive development.
