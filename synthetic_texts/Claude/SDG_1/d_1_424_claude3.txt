The International Youth Foundation presents a comprehensive analysis on the progress and challenges surrounding the first Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 1): End poverty in all its forms everywhere. 

Poverty remains a persistent global challenge, with multidimensional consequences that extend far beyond mere income deprivation. Despite concerted efforts and some progress, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing vulnerabilities and inequalities, reversing hard-won gains and pushing an additional 119 to 124 million people into extreme poverty in 2020 alone.

Eradicating poverty requires a multifaceted approach that addresses its root causes and manifestations across different contexts. Poverty is inextricably linked to a lack of access to basic services, limited economic opportunities, social exclusion, and vulnerability to shocks and disasters. Breaking this vicious cycle necessitates targeted interventions that empower individuals, households, and communities to build resilience and achieve sustainable livelihoods.

In rural areas, poverty is often characterized by limited access to productive resources, such as land, credit, and technology, compounded by environmental degradation and climate change impacts. Addressing rural poverty requires investing in sustainable agriculture, improving rural infrastructure, and promoting diversified livelihood opportunities. Initiatives like the Productive Social Safety Net Program in Ethiopia have demonstrated the potential of combining social protection mechanisms with asset-building and community-driven development approaches.

In urban settings, poverty manifests through inadequate housing, limited access to basic services, and a lack of decent employment opportunities. Rapid urbanization and the proliferation of informal settlements pose unique challenges that require innovative solutions. Inclusive urban planning, upgrading informal settlements, and promoting decent work opportunities through skills development and entrepreneurship support are crucial.

Gender inequality remains a significant driver of poverty, with women and girls disproportionately affected. Empowering women through access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities is not only a matter of human rights but also a catalyst for breaking intergenerational cycles of poverty. Initiatives like the Adolescent Girls Initiative, implemented in several countries, have demonstrated the transformative impact of combining life skills training, education, and livelihood support for young women.

Social protection systems play a vital role in mitigating the impacts of poverty and promoting resilience. However, many countries still lack comprehensive and well-targeted social protection programs, leaving significant gaps in coverage, especially for vulnerable groups such as informal workers, migrants, and persons with disabilities. Strengthening these systems, ensuring adequate financing, and promoting social inclusion are essential for achieving SDG 1.

Addressing poverty also requires tackling broader systemic issues, such as inequality, governance, and conflict. Inclusive and accountable institutions, effective revenue mobilization, and equitable distribution of resources are critical for creating an enabling environment for poverty reduction. Additionally, addressing the root causes of conflict and promoting peaceful societies is essential for sustainable development, as conflict exacerbates poverty and undermines progress.

Innovative financing mechanisms, such as blended finance and impact investing, can mobilize additional resources for poverty reduction efforts. However, ensuring transparency, accountability, and alignment with local priorities is crucial to maximize the effectiveness of these initiatives.

Achieving SDG 1 requires a concerted effort from all stakeholders, including governments, civil society organizations, the private sector, and international development partners. Collaboration, knowledge-sharing, and leveraging synergies across different sectors and initiatives are essential for maximizing impact and ensuring no one is left behind.
