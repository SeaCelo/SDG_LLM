SDG 1: No Poverty - Eradicating Extreme Poverty for Inclusive Growth

By Mark L. Gertler

The first of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), to "end poverty in all its forms everywhere," is undoubtedly an ambitious and formidable undertaking. Poverty is a multidimensional phenomenon, deeply entrenched in the complex interplay of economic, social, political, and environmental factors. Eradicating extreme poverty, therefore, requires a holistic and multifaceted approach that addresses both the immediate needs and the underlying structural causes.

At the outset, it is crucial to acknowledge the remarkable progress made in reducing global poverty over the past few decades. The proportion of the world's population living in extreme poverty, defined as living on less than $1.90 per day, has declined from nearly 36% in 1990 to around 9% in 2020. This remarkable achievement can be attributed to a combination of factors, including sustained economic growth, particularly in emerging economies, improved access to education and healthcare, and targeted poverty alleviation programs.

However, the COVID-19 pandemic has threatened to reverse these hard-won gains, pushing an additional 97 million people into extreme poverty in 2020 alone. This stark reality underscores the fragility of progress and the urgent need for renewed, concerted efforts to tackle poverty in all its dimensions.

One of the fundamental challenges in addressing poverty is its self-perpetuating nature. Poverty is both a cause and a consequence of various socioeconomic factors, including lack of access to education, healthcare, and productive resources, as well as social exclusion, discrimination, and marginalization. This vicious cycle can be broken only through a comprehensive approach that simultaneously addresses the immediate needs of the poor while also creating an enabling environment for sustainable and inclusive growth.

At the heart of this approach lies the need for inclusive and pro-poor economic policies that foster job creation, promote entrepreneurship, and provide access to productive resources and financial services. Governments must prioritize investments in human capital development, particularly in education and healthcare, to equip the poor with the skills and capabilities needed to participate in and benefit from economic growth.

Furthermore, social protection programs, such as cash transfers, public works programs, and targeted subsidies, can play a crucial role in providing a safety net for the most vulnerable and mitigating the immediate impacts of poverty. However, these programs must be designed and implemented in a way that promotes self-reliance and empowerment, rather than creating dependency.

Equally important is the need to address the structural barriers that perpetuate poverty, such as inequality, discrimination, and exclusion. This requires a concerted effort to promote inclusive governance, strengthen institutions, and ensure equal access to opportunities and resources for all, regardless of gender, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status.

Ultimately, the eradication of extreme poverty requires a global partnership that brings together governments, civil society, the private sector, and international organizations. Developed countries must fulfill their commitments to providing official development assistance and promoting fair trade practices, while developing countries must prioritize pro-poor policies and create an enabling environment for sustainable and inclusive growth.

In conclusion, achieving SDG 1 is not merely a moral imperative but also a vital prerequisite for achieving the other SDGs and fostering a more prosperous, equitable, and sustainable world. By addressing the multidimensional nature of poverty and adopting a comprehensive and inclusive approach, we can break the vicious cycle of poverty and create a virtuous cycle of sustainable and inclusive growth, where no one is left behind.
