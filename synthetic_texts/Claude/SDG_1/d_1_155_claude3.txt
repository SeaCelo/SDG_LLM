Here is a detailed response as if written by Maureen Dowd as a long academic article about SDG 1 - No Poverty:

The Appalling Indignity of Global Poverty

When you strip away the veneer and really look at the world we've constructed, it's an outrageous affront to human dignity. In this modern era of soaring skyscrapers, private jets and $500 billion companies selling slightly improved JPEGs as NFTs, nearly one in ten people still live in extreme poverty. That's over 689 million human beings subsisting on less than $1.90 a day. 

These aren't just statistics uttered in a boring report before diplomats languidly sip their chardonnay. These are lives of ceaseless toil, an endless cycle of scarcity and desperation. Imagine having to decide between meager scraps of food or clean water for your children. Envision the desolation of watching a loved one succumb to a treatable disease because basic healthcare is priced as an impossible dream.

And for what? So anonymous hedge funders can buy another Hamptons hideaway? So Silicon Valley libertarians pushing the obsolete fallacy of trickle-down economics can afford the latest supercar? The sickening decadence and nonchalance towards systemic suffering in which we're steeped is an injustice rivaled only by a Dostoevsky novel.  

The poorest of the poor suffer most cruelly. Those in the bottom billion endure a bleak existence lacking opportunity, access to education, basic infrastructure and pathways to economic mobility. Cycles of destitution echo through generations, a sad inertia born from accidents of geography and legacy systems of exploitation.

We smugly congratulate ourselves on incremental progress, like the decline in extreme poverty from 36% in 1990. But our self-congratulation rings hollow when nearly half the world struggles to meet basic needs. The bitter irony is how little it would take to eliminate poverty entirely.

Economists estimate that $175 billion a year could lift everyone over the poverty line and provide basic social safety nets. That's about what American companies spent on stock buybacks and dividends in 2018 alone. It's a rounding error compared to the cost of bailing out Wall Street and waging senseless wars that only breed more privation.  

Yet we lack the moral clarity and political will to denounce poverty as the scourge it is. We're mired in consumerist stupors, trivialities and useless culture wars stoked by demagogues and corporate puppeteers. The wretched of the Earth suffer silently while social media's dullard gatekeepers obsess over celebrity gossip, outrage porn and the latest meme.  

Meanwhile, rapacious multinational firms plunder developing nations' resources, exploiting tax havens, labor loopholes and toothless regulations to hoard more offshore wealth than the combined GDP of the world's poor. Corporate impunity in an age of accelerating inequality is a scathing condemnation of our withered ethics as a civilization.

Perhaps future generations will look upon our collective complacency towards poverty with the same revulsion we feel towards the nepotism and tyranny that spawned the French Revolution. Or maybe the masses will rise up first, as mass uprisings like the Arab Spring already provide harrowing previews of the unrest that festers amid hopeless immiseration.

We possess the resources and means to eliminate poverty. What we lack is the courage and moral conviction to upend entrenched systems of greed and indifference that perpetuate misery. Willful deprivation amid abundance is an outrageous crime we've normalized through malignant hypocrisy and myopia.  

On a planet of such staggering wealth, poverty is not tragedy but a choice - one we make every day through acquiescence and inertia. The sooner we reckon with that searing truth, the sooner we can begin atoning for one of humanity's most egregious generational sins.
