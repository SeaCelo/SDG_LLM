As the premier Swiss agency dedicated to promoting sustainable development and reducing global poverty, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) has been at the forefront of addressing Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1): "End poverty in all its forms everywhere." Our commitment to this goal stems from a deep understanding that poverty is a multidimensional phenomenon, encompassing not only income deprivation but also lack of access to essential services, social exclusion, and vulnerability to external shocks.

Through our extensive fieldwork and empirical research, we have identified several key challenges that impede progress towards SDG 1. First and foremost, the persistence of extreme poverty, defined as living on less than $1.90 per day, remains a significant obstacle, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and conflict-affected regions. Despite substantial progress in reducing extreme poverty globally, pockets of deep-rooted deprivation persist, exacerbated by factors such as poor governance, conflict, and environmental degradation.

Moreover, our analysis highlights the prevalence of relative poverty, wherein individuals and households lack the resources to achieve a minimum standard of living, even in countries with higher overall income levels. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced in urban areas, where the cost of living is often substantially higher, and informal settlements lack access to basic services and infrastructure.

Another critical challenge is the disproportionate impact of poverty on vulnerable groups, including women, children, persons with disabilities, and marginalized communities. Our field studies have revealed that these groups often face systemic barriers to economic opportunities, education, and social protection, perpetuating intergenerational cycles of poverty.

Furthermore, the SDC recognizes the inextricable link between poverty and environmental degradation. Climate change, deforestation, and unsustainable resource extraction not only exacerbate poverty but also undermine the long-term sustainability of development efforts. This vicious cycle disproportionately affects poor communities that rely heavily on natural resources for their livelihoods.

To address these multifaceted challenges, the SDC has adopted a holistic approach that integrates economic, social, and environmental dimensions. Our interventions span a wide range of areas, including promoting inclusive economic growth, enhancing access to quality education and healthcare, strengthening social protection systems, and fostering sustainable natural resource management.

One of our flagship initiatives is the Inclusive Economic Development (IED) program, which aims to create sustainable economic opportunities for marginalized groups, particularly in rural areas. Through this program, we provide technical assistance and seed funding to support the development of inclusive value chains, facilitate access to finance, and promote entrepreneurship. By fostering inclusive economic growth, the IED program not only generates income but also empowers individuals and communities, enhancing their resilience to economic shocks.

Complementing our economic interventions, the SDC places a strong emphasis on strengthening social protection systems, recognizing their critical role in mitigating poverty and vulnerability. We collaborate with national governments and local partners to design and implement targeted cash transfer programs, social insurance schemes, and public employment initiatives. These interventions not only provide a safety net for the poorest and most vulnerable but also promote human capital development by increasing access to education and healthcare.

To address the environmental dimension of poverty, the SDC has pioneered innovative approaches to sustainable natural resource management. Our flagship program, the Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) initiative, aims to enhance the resilience of communities to climate change impacts while simultaneously promoting biodiversity conservation and sustainable livelihoods. Through this program, we support the implementation of ecosystem-based solutions, such as agroforestry, sustainable land management practices, and community-based natural resource governance.

Underpinning our interventions is a strong commitment to evidence-based policymaking and continuous learning. The SDC maintains a robust monitoring and evaluation framework to assess the impact of our programs and ensure accountability to our stakeholders. We actively collaborate with academic institutions, think tanks, and local research partners to generate rigorous data and analytics that inform our decision-making processes.

Furthermore, the SDC recognizes the importance of multi-stakeholder partnerships in achieving SDG 1. We actively engage with national governments, civil society organizations, the private sector, and international development partners to leverage our collective resources, expertise, and reach. By fostering inclusive dialogue and collaboration, we aim to catalyze systemic change and achieve lasting impact on poverty reduction.

In conclusion, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation remains steadfast in its commitment to ending poverty in all its forms. Through our multifaceted approach, innovative programs, and strong partnerships, we strive to create sustainable economic opportunities, strengthen social protection systems, and promote environmental sustainability. While significant challenges persist, our unwavering dedication and evidence-based interventions position us as a leading force in the global fight against poverty, contributing to the realization of SDG 1 and the broader sustainable development agenda.
