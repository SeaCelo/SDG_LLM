Here is a draft academic article on SDG 1 (No Poverty) from the perspective of the late economist Martin S. Feldstein:

Eradicating poverty lies at the core of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. As we strive to "end poverty in all its forms everywhere," we must recognize that this immense challenge requires a comprehensive, multidimensional approach that extends well beyond increasing incomes for the world's poorest. Poverty is truly a "wicked problem" -- its causes are complex and interconnected, spanning economic, political, social, and environmental realms. Overcoming it demands that we dismantle the self-perpetuating cycles that entrench communities in destitution across generations.

Economic growth and job creation underpin any viable poverty reduction strategy. However, focusing solely on income overlooks poverty's non-income dimensions like inadequate access to education, healthcare, housing, and personal security. Worse, growth alone is often spatially unbalanced, exacerbating inequality between prospering urban centers and stagnating rural hinterlands. The risk of being poor is compounded for disadvantaged groups facing structural barriers — women, minorities, the disabled, and displaced persons among them.

A key imperative, therefore, is developing inclusive economies and social protection systems resilient to economic shocks, conflicts, and natural disasters. Establishing a secure social safety net not only prevents transient income losses from spiraling into chronic, intergenerational poverty, but empowers the poor to make productivity-enhancing investments in health, education, and self-employment. Cash transfers, conditional and unconditional, have proven an effective "hand-up" when carefully designed and implemented.

That said, cash transfers are ultimately an interim measure. The end goal must be productive employment and economic self-sufficiency. Public investments in human capital — healthcare, nutrition, early childhood development — yield immense future returns by nurturing cognitive abilities and earning potentials. Developing countries should prioritize universal access to high-quality basic education, vocational training aligned with labor market needs, and the infrastructure to facilitate rural-urban labor mobility.

Critically, domestic resource mobilization through robust tax systems and efforts to combat corruption and illicit financial flows are vital for financing these anti-poverty programs sustainably. Overreliance on foreign aid breeds a culture of dependency and denies agency to developing nations to determine and execute their own poverty reduction strategies.

Institutional and sociocultural transformations are equally essential. Institutionalizing participatory governance builds inclusive decision-making processes with accountability to the poor. Dismantling discriminatory norms and practices that marginalize vulnerable populations like women and minorities fosters economic empowerment and upholds basic human rights.

In an increasingly interconnected world, poverty anywhere exacerbates threats to prosperity everywhere through elevated disease burdens, fraying social cohesion, and propensity for civil unrest. Developed and developing nations alike face strong incentives to collaborate on eliminating poverty's root causes. Providing the poorest a dignified life free of want is not only a moral imperative for a just global society, but a pragmatic investment in human capital, political stability, and our shared future.
