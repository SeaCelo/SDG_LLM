Here is a detailed newspaper article about Sustainable Development Goal 1 (No Poverty), as if written for Forbes:

A Lofty Goal: Ending Poverty in all its Forms Everywhere

By 2030, the United Nations aims to eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere - currently defined as living on less than $1.90 a day. It is an ambitious target that will require mobilizing efforts to promote inclusive economic growth, social development, and environmental protection on an unprecedented scale.

While global poverty rates have been cut by more than half since 2000, one in five people in developing regions still live on less than $1.90 a day. Projecting ahead, forecasts show that at the current rate of progress, economic situation will improve over the next 50 years. However, this rate is still too slow to end extreme poverty worldwide by 2030 as per the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1) targets.

The Harsh Reality
Poverty is not just a lack of income and resources. It is a cruel perpetual cycle that manifests itself through hunger, lack of access to education and basic services, social discrimination, and exclusion from decision-making. It represents a major barrier to overcoming crises, conflicts, and disasters. With COVID-19 impacting nearly every country, estimates show the crisis alone could push over 70 million people into extreme poverty.

According to World Bank data, about 10% of the global population survived on $1.90 a day or less in 2015. That's a staggering 734 million people struggling to afford basic human needs like health, education and access to water and sanitation. Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for two-thirds of this extreme poverty, with rates reaching as high as 42% in some parts.

It is not just about subsisting below the poverty line. Over 40% of the global population lacks social protection coverage. Nearly 60% of the world's population has no access to any form of social safety net to cushion them against hardships from economic shocks, unemployment, illness, disability, or other risks.

Breaking the Cycle
SDG 1 calls for accelerating progress by implementing national social protection systems, increasing access to economic resources and basic services, and building resilience to environmental shocks and disasters. Some strategies gaining traction include:

Social Protection Floors: Providing access to essential health care and income security through measures like universal health coverage, unemployment benefits, disability pensions, and child/family benefits.

Progressive Taxation: Developed countries instituting fair policies like raising top income tax rates and preventing tax avoidance to redistribute wealth and expand fiscal space for social programs.  

Financial Inclusion: Promoting access to affordable financial services like credit, insurance, and mobile banking, especially for women and marginalized groups. Over 1.7 billion adults remain unbanked globally.

Climate Resilience: Investing in resilient infrastructure, disaster risk reduction strategies, and social safety nets to protect the poor from economic losses and rebuild from setbacks caused by climate-related disasters.

Pro-Poor Growth: Focusing economic growth models on job creation, living wages, urban-rural connectivity, support for smallholder farmers, and creating opportunities for marginalized communities.

The Business Case 
While SDG 1's emphasis is on protecting the world's most vulnerable through measures like social protection systems and basic services, the private sector has an important role to play. The economic costs of poverty extend far beyond just humanitarian factors.

Extreme poverty fuels instability, displacement, and conflicts that disrupt trade, supply chains, and investments. According to the World Bank, annual losses from productivity decreases and health expenses due to child undernutrition can cost some countries as much as 16.5% of their GDP. 

Meanwhile, studies show that countries with lower poverty rates and healthier, educated workforces benefit from more rapid economic growth. Reducing poverty boosts domestic demand and creates business opportunities to serve large underserved markets for housing, healthcare, education, and other services.

The world has an unprecedented opportunity to rid itself of extreme poverty once and for all by 2030. However, delivering on this ambitious agenda will require unprecedented efforts from governments, civil society, and the private sector globally. No single actor can achieve this alone. Only through innovative multi-stakeholder partnerships, bold financing models, and shared accountability can we uplift the world's poorest and deliver on the 2030 promise.
