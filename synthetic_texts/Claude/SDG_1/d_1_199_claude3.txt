Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 1 (No Poverty), written from the perspective of the late economist Walter E. Williams:

The Moral Tragedy of Global Poverty

By Walter E. Williams

The fact that billions of people around the world live in abject poverty represents one of the greatest moral failings of our time. The noble-sounding Sustainable Development Goal to "end poverty in all its forms everywhere" rings hollow when we look at the harsh realities. Poverty is not a lack of money or material resources - it is a lack of freedom. And freedom can only be achieved through personal liberty and economic liberty working hand-in-hand.

Let's start with some sobering numbers. According to the World Bank, around 9.2% of the global population lives in extreme poverty, subsisting on less than $1.90 per day. That's nearly 700 million people struggling to survive. Poverty's grip remains tightest in sub-Saharan Africa, where over 40% of people live below the international poverty line. The sheer scale of human deprivation is staggering.

But poverty is not just about low incomes. It robs human beings of dignity, opportunity and basic rights. The poor suffer inadequate access to food, clean water, sanitation, healthcare and education. They are vulnerable to exploitation, human trafficking and unjust treatment by corrupt state officials. A decent quality of life remains tragically out of reach for far too many.

The fundamental driver of poverty is not scarcity – it is a lack of economic freedom. Where property rights are insecure, where contract enforcement is weak, where markets are hamstrung by excessive regulation and taxation – that is where poverty persists. Economic freedom unlocks the human ingenuity and entrepreneurial drive required to create sustainable prosperity.

Just look at the divergent paths of East and West Germany after WWII. East Germany implemented a socialist command economy while West Germany opted for free market capitalism. Within a few decades, the economicfreedoms in West Germany made its citizens vastly more prosperous than their counterparts imprisoned behind the Iron Curtain. Communism and central planning created poverty, while economic liberty created wealth.

We see this pattern repeated worldwide. Nations with high levels of economic freedom like Singapore, New Zealand and Switzerland enjoy high standards of living with minimal poverty. Meanwhile, many resource-rich countries in Africa remain mired in poverty precisely because they lack property rights, rule of law and low regulation that incentivizes productive entrepreneurship.

There are no quick fixes or foreign aid solutions to ending systemic, generational poverty. It requires fundamental institutional reforms that decentralize power and give people greater control over their lives and livelihoods. Privatizing land ownership, establishing robust judicial systems, lowering regulatory hurdles for entrepreneurs, abolishing cronyism and cutting destructive taxation. In short - expanding economic liberty.

Until nations allow the invisible hand of the free market to raise the poor out of poverty, grandiose global goals will remain just empty rhetoric. Breaking the cycle of poverty comes down to trusting the judgments of individuals pursuing their own interests in voluntary exchanges, not the whims of elite planners and bureaucrats pursuing utopian visions of enforced equality.

Some may lament that economic freedom causes temporary inequalities as wealth creators pull ahead of others. But an unequal world where living standards improve for everyone is far more moral than the enforced equality of a universal poverty pit from which no one can escape. Could anyone honestly argue that poverty has been ended when everyone is impoverished under an iron fist of totalitarian control?

The true path to ending poverty is economic emancipation – getting state planners off the backs of the disadvantaged and giving them the freedom to profit from their own industry and ingenuity. Only then can we expect to see the dignity of self-ownership, the pride of self-reliance, and the prosperity of productive human beings flourishing as they were meant to. Freedom paves the way for the philanthropic spirit to be realized voluntarily. Coerced redistributions through the state merely breed dependency and resentment.

So let us have the moral courage to reckon with the facts. The nanny state has been a failure in alleviating poverty at home and abroad. Top-down resource transfers treating the poor as helpless wards of social planners is an insult to human potential. The real moral imperative is to untie the hands of the disadvantaged by unleashing their economic liberty. Then and only then can the noble vision of ending poverty be realized through the incomparable engine of capitalist wealth creation.
