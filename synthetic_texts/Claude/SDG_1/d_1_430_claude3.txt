As a leading humanitarian organization at the forefront of addressing global poverty and its multifaceted consequences, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) recognizes the urgency of achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1: No Poverty. Our teams worldwide have witnessed the devastating impact of poverty on human lives, particularly in regions grappling with conflict, epidemics, and natural disasters.

The global landscape of poverty remains a complex and multidimensional challenge, with over 700 million people living in extreme poverty, subsisting on less than $1.90 per day. This sobering statistic underscores the pressing need for concerted efforts and innovative strategies to eradicate poverty in all its forms and dimensions.

Poverty is not merely a lack of income or resources; it is a denial of human dignity, a deprivation of basic rights and opportunities. It perpetuates a vicious cycle of vulnerability, ill health, and marginalization, trapping generations in a state of hopelessness and despair. Addressing poverty requires a holistic approach that tackles its root causes and intersecting factors, such as inequality, lack of access to education and healthcare, discrimination, and environmental degradation.

In conflict-affected regions where MSF operates, poverty exacerbates the impact of violence and displacement, rendering communities even more vulnerable to health emergencies, food insecurity, and exploitation. The protracted crises in Yemen, South Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of Congo are stark reminders of how poverty compounds the effects of armed conflict, leading to widespread malnutrition, disease outbreaks, and a breakdown of essential services.

Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has brutally exposed the stark inequalities that exist within and across nations, with the poorest and most marginalized communities bearing the brunt of the socioeconomic consequences. MSF's frontline response has highlighted the dire need for robust social protection systems, universal healthcare coverage, and resilient livelihoods to safeguard the most vulnerable populations against shocks and crises.

Addressing poverty requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses economic empowerment, access to quality education, healthcare, and social services, as well as addressing structural inequalities and promoting inclusive governance. MSF's interventions in regions plagued by poverty often involve collaboration with local communities, governments, and other stakeholders to develop sustainable solutions tailored to specific contexts.

For instance, in the remote regions of the Central African Republic, MSF has implemented integrated programs that combine medical care with livelihood support, such as providing agricultural training and inputs to enhance food security and income generation. In Bangladesh, our teams have worked closely with Rohingya refugee communities, not only providing essential healthcare but also supporting educational initiatives and advocating for their rights and dignified living conditions.

Achieving SDG 1 necessitates a paradigm shift in how we perceive and address poverty. It requires a human-centered approach that empowers individuals and communities, fosters resilience, and promotes inclusive economic growth. Innovative financing mechanisms, such as impact investing and public-private partnerships, can mobilize resources and accelerate progress toward poverty eradication.

Furthermore, addressing the root causes of poverty demands a concerted effort to tackle structural inequalities, discrimination, and the marginalization of vulnerable groups, including women, children, persons with disabilities, and indigenous communities. MSF's advocacy efforts consistently highlight the need for inclusive policies, equitable access to resources, and the protection of human rights as essential components of sustainable poverty reduction strategies.

As we confront the multidimensional challenges of poverty, MSF remains steadfast in its commitment to alleviating suffering, promoting human dignity, and advocating for equitable access to basic services and opportunities. Through our medical humanitarian interventions, capacity-building initiatives, and strategic partnerships, we strive to contribute to the global effort toward achieving SDG 1, ensuring that no one is left behind in the pursuit of a more just and prosperous world.
