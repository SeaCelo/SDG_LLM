As an integral component of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, SDG 1 aims to "End poverty in all its forms everywhere." Poverty is a multidimensional phenomenon that extends beyond mere income deprivation, encompassing inadequate access to essential services, exclusion from decision-making processes, and vulnerabilities that perpetuate intergenerational cycles of impoverishment. Eradicating poverty is not only a moral imperative but also a prerequisite for achieving sustainable development, as it intersects with various other SDGs, including those related to health, education, gender equality, and decent work.

The International Labour Organization (ILO) recognizes that poverty alleviation is intrinsically linked to the promotion of decent work opportunities and the protection of workers' rights. Unemployment, underemployment, and precarious employment conditions are significant drivers of poverty, particularly in developing countries. Moreover, the lack of social protection measures exacerbates the vulnerability of workers and their families, leaving them exposed to economic shocks, health crises, and environmental disasters.

To address this challenge, the ILO advocates for the implementation of comprehensive strategies that integrate employment creation, social protection, and inclusive economic growth. One such approach is the promotion of sustainable enterprises, which involves creating an enabling environment for businesses to thrive while adhering to international labour standards and promoting socially responsible practices. This includes fostering entrepreneurship, facilitating access to finance, and providing business development services, particularly for marginalized groups and those in the informal economy.

Furthermore, the ILO emphasizes the importance of investing in skills development and lifelong learning opportunities. By equipping individuals with the necessary knowledge and competencies, they can enhance their employability and adaptability in rapidly evolving labour markets. This is especially crucial in the context of technological advancements and the transition towards greener economies, which require workers to acquire new skills and retrain for emerging job opportunities.

Additionally, the ILO recognizes the need for robust social protection systems that provide income security and access to essential services, such as healthcare, education, and housing. These systems not only mitigate the immediate impacts of poverty but also promote resilience and enable individuals and households to invest in their future, breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty.

Addressing poverty also necessitates tackling discrimination and promoting equal opportunities for all, regardless of gender, age, disability, or other factors. The ILO advocates for gender-responsive policies and initiatives that empower women, promote equal pay for work of equal value, and address barriers to their participation in the labour force. Similarly, the organization emphasizes the importance of ensuring decent work opportunities for youth, persons with disabilities, and other marginalized groups.

Achieving SDG 1 requires collaboration and concerted efforts among various stakeholders, including governments, employers' organizations, workers' organizations, civil society, and international development partners. The ILO plays a crucial role in facilitating social dialogue, promoting international labour standards, and providing technical assistance to member states in the formulation and implementation of national policies and programs.

It is important to note that the eradication of poverty is inextricably linked to progress in other SDGs, such as SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), and SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions). Addressing poverty requires a holistic approach that considers the interconnected nature of these goals and fosters policy coherence and integrated strategies.
