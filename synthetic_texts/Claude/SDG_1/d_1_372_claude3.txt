The International Organization for Migration (IOM) recognizes that the eradication of poverty in all its forms (SDG 1) is inextricably linked to migration dynamics. Poverty remains a stark reality for millions of migrants, internally displaced persons (IDPs), and refugees, often perpetuating a vicious cycle of vulnerability, marginalization, and exploitation.

Through our extensive field operations and research, we have observed that poverty is not only a driver of migration but also a consequence of it. In many cases, the decision to migrate is a coping strategy for individuals and families seeking to escape destitution, conflict, or environmental degradation. However, the migration process itself can expose them to new forms of poverty, particularly if they lack access to decent work, healthcare, and social protection.

Addressing poverty within the context of migration requires a multidimensional approach that acknowledges the complexities and intersectionalities of this global challenge. Our analysis highlights the following key areas of intervention:

1. Empowering migrants and host communities through livelihood opportunities:
Ensuring access to decent work and sustainable income-generating activities is crucial for migrants, IDPs, and refugees to break the cycle of poverty. IOM's initiatives, such as skills development programs, entrepreneurship support, and private sector engagement, have demonstrated the potential to enhance economic self-reliance and integration. However, these efforts must be scaled up and complemented by policy reforms that facilitate labor market inclusion and protect the rights of migrant workers.

2. Enhancing access to essential services and social protection:
Migrants, IDPs, and refugees often face significant barriers in accessing basic services, including healthcare, education, and social safety nets. IOM advocates for the inclusion of these populations in national and local service delivery systems, as well as the development of targeted interventions that address their specific needs. Innovative approaches, such as mobile clinics, community-based education, and cash-based assistance, have shown promising results in ensuring that no one is left behind.

3. Addressing the root causes of forced migration and displacement:
Poverty is often exacerbated by conflict, environmental degradation, and human rights violations, which can lead to forced migration and displacement. IOM works closely with governments, civil society, and international partners to address these root causes through peacebuilding initiatives, disaster risk reduction, and the promotion of sustainable development practices in areas of origin. Particular attention must be given to the nexus between climate change, environmental degradation, and poverty, as these factors increasingly shape migration patterns.

4. Promoting inclusive and cohesive societies:
The successful integration of migrants, IDPs, and refugees into host communities is essential for their socio-economic well-being and the overall achievement of SDG 1. IOM supports initiatives that foster social cohesion, promote cultural understanding, and combat xenophobia and discrimination. Inclusive policies and practices that facilitate access to housing, education, and public services for these populations are crucial in preventing marginalization and promoting their active participation in society.

IOM recognizes that addressing poverty in the context of migration requires a whole-of-society approach, involving governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector. Through our global presence and partnerships, we continue to advocate for policy coherence, evidence-based interventions, and the meaningful participation of migrants, IDPs, and refugees in decision-making processes that affect their lives.

Only by addressing the multidimensional drivers and impacts of poverty within the context of migration can we truly achieve the ambitious targets set forth by SDG 1 and ensure a more prosperous, inclusive, and sustainable future for all.
