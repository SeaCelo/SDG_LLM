The Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA) recognizes that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions remains one of the greatest challenges facing humanity. Despite significant progress made in reducing extreme poverty over the past few decades, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing inequalities and reversed hard-won gains, pushing millions more into poverty and destitution.

ADRA's commitment to achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1 – No Poverty – is rooted in the belief that poverty is a multidimensional phenomenon that extends beyond mere income deprivation. It encompasses a lack of access to basic services, resources, and opportunities, as well as vulnerability to economic, social, and environmental shocks. Addressing poverty requires a holistic and integrated approach that tackles its root causes and creates an enabling environment for sustainable livelihoods.

ADRA's strategy for combating poverty is guided by four pillars: inclusive economic growth, social protection, empowerment, and resilience building. Our interventions are tailored to the specific contexts and needs of the communities we serve, leveraging our extensive field presence and partnerships with local actors.

Inclusive economic growth is at the heart of our poverty reduction efforts. ADRA recognizes that sustainable and inclusive growth is crucial for creating decent employment opportunities and enabling people to lift themselves out of poverty. We promote inclusive and sustainable agricultural practices, support micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises, and facilitate access to finance and markets. Our interventions are designed to foster economic diversification, value chain development, and the creation of sustainable livelihoods.

Social protection is another critical component of our poverty alleviation strategy. ADRA works to strengthen social protection systems and ensure access to essential services, such as health, education, and basic infrastructure. We advocate for universal access to social protection floors, including cash transfers, social insurance, and other safety net programs. These interventions not only protect the most vulnerable from falling deeper into poverty but also promote human capital development and foster resilience.

Empowerment lies at the core of ADRA's approach, as we believe that sustainable poverty reduction requires the active participation and ownership of affected communities. We promote the empowerment of women, youth, and marginalized groups through capacity-building, skill development, and the creation of inclusive and participatory decision-making processes. Our interventions aim to address structural barriers and challenge harmful social norms that perpetuate poverty and inequality.

Resilience building is crucial in the face of increasing climate-related disasters, conflicts, and other shocks that can reverse hard-won development gains. ADRA works to strengthen the adaptive capacity of communities and households by promoting diversified livelihoods, disaster risk reduction strategies, and climate-smart practices. We also support the development of early warning systems and contingency planning to mitigate the impacts of shocks and ensure a rapid and effective response.

ADRA's work on SDG 1 is guided by a strong commitment to evidence-based programming, continuous learning, and adaptation. We leverage innovative approaches, such as adaptive social protection systems, climate-smart agriculture, and digital financial inclusion, to enhance the effectiveness and sustainability of our interventions. Our monitoring and evaluation systems are designed to capture the multidimensional aspects of poverty, enabling us to track progress, identify gaps, and adjust our strategies accordingly.

In our efforts to eradicate poverty, ADRA recognizes the interconnectedness of the SDGs and the need for a comprehensive and integrated approach. We actively collaborate with a wide range of stakeholders, including governments, civil society organizations, the private sector, and
