Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 1 (No Poverty), written from the perspective of Neal Rubin, a renowned expert on global poverty and sustainable development:

The first of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals is the enormously ambitious – yet utterly imperative – target of ending poverty in all its forms, everywhere, within 15 years. Representing the culmination of decades of economic analysis, social theory, political advocacy, and real-world interventions, SDG 1 crystallizes a moral vision of a world that is prosperous, equitable, and sustainable for all people.  

While cynics may dismiss such a goal as naively utopian, we have never before possessed the aggregate wealth, innovative mindset, and cosmic perspective required to realistically conceive of a planet without poverty. Global poverty rates have already declined by over two-thirds in recent decades, and our scientific understanding of the systemic causes and transmission mechanisms of deprivation deepens daily. The task that remains is ensuring this hard-won knowledge catalyzes durable policies and programs engineered to strike at the roots of poverty.

Central to SDG 1 is the realization that poverty represents not merely a shortfall of income, but rather a multidimensional web of disadvantages encompassing malnutrition, inadequate housing, energy deficits, tenuous livelihoods, lack of education and health services, sociopolitical marginalization, and vulnerability to environmental and economic shocks. This intricate deprivation trap manifests at individual, household, community, and national levels, perpetuating an intergenerational cycle that bars billions from achieving their innate human potential.

Escaping this cycle necessitates a holistic portfolio of investments. Microfinance, skills training, asset transfers, social safety nets, and policies supporting decent work represent the critical on-ramps for enabling the impoverished to progressively build economic resilience. Just as importantly, universal provision of basic public services in nutrition, health, education, water/sanitation, clean energy access, and environmental security forms the essential scaffolding for translating economic opportunity into higher living standards and capabilities. Complementing these interventions, enhanced domestic resource mobilization and redistribution mechanisms can equitably channel national income gains toward programs directly benefiting the poorest populations. 

Yet even with ample political will, realizing SDG 1 will require transcending traditional development silos and cultivating synergistic multi-stakeholder partnerships between governments, civil society, private sector, and international institutions. This grand cross-sectoral synchronization is vital for tackling poverty's structurally embedded nature across all domains of society.

Perhaps most critically, fulfilling SDG 1 obliges a paradigm shift in how we conceive of development itself – transforming it from a top-down, economistic model into a holistic, people-centered vision of societal advancement. By re-orienting development squarely toward expanding substantive freedoms and honoring the agency, dignity and manifold identities of all persons, we can finally uproot deprivation in all its myriad manifestations. For in bequeathing a world without poverty to posterity, we shall have actualized the most affirmative conception of civilizational progress the human saga has yet known.
