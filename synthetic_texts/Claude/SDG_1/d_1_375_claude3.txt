Eradicating poverty in all its forms remains one of the greatest challenges we face as a global community. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) recognizes that sustainable economic growth, driven by private sector investment, is a crucial catalyst for reducing poverty and promoting shared prosperity. Our approach is multifaceted, leveraging our unique position at the intersection of public and private sectors to catalyze investments that create jobs, foster economic opportunities, and improve access to essential services.

Through our political risk insurance and credit enhancement products, we facilitate foreign direct investment (FDI) flows into developing countries, particularly those most vulnerable to economic shocks and fragility. By mitigating non-commercial risks, we enable investors to channel capital into projects that might otherwise be deemed too risky, unlocking vital financing for infrastructure, manufacturing, agribusiness, and services sectors – the backbone of inclusive growth.

Our strategic focus extends beyond mere capital mobilization; we prioritize investments that have the potential to generate far-reaching socioeconomic impacts. For instance, we actively support projects that promote financial inclusion, expand access to affordable housing, and enhance connectivity through digital infrastructure – all critical enablers for poverty reduction and economic empowerment.

Recognizing the disproportionate impact of poverty on women and marginalized communities, we have mainstreamed gender and social inclusion considerations into our operations. Our Environmental and Social Sustainability Policy, aligned with the International Finance Corporation's Performance Standards, ensures that projects we support respect human rights, promote equitable development, and minimize adverse impacts on vulnerable groups.

Furthermore, MIGA's innovative blended finance solutions leverage public and private capital to support high-impact projects in the world's poorest countries and fragile contexts. By strategically deploying our risk mitigation tools, we help crowd in private investment where it is most needed, yet often scarce due to elevated risks.

Building on our comparative advantage as a multilateral institution, we collaborate closely with development partners, governments, and the private sector to foster an enabling environment for inclusive growth. Our advisory services and technical assistance programs aim to strengthen institutional capacity, improve regulatory frameworks, and promote responsible business practices – all essential ingredients for sustainable poverty reduction.

Through our strategic interventions, we strive to create a virtuous cycle where increased private investment translates into job creation, income generation, and improved access to essential services, thereby empowering individuals and communities to lift themselves out of poverty. However, we recognize that eradicating poverty is a complex, multidimensional challenge that requires concerted efforts from all stakeholders.

As we look ahead, MIGA remains committed to leveraging our unique capabilities and forging strategic partnerships to mobilize and catalyze private capital for projects that drive inclusive and sustainable economic growth. By doing so, we aim to contribute significantly to the global effort of ending poverty in all its forms, leaving no one behind.
