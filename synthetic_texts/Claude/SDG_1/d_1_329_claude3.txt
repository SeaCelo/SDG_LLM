Eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions remains a daunting global challenge, and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) is at the forefront of this battle. Our unwavering commitment to Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1) – "No Poverty" – is driven by a deep understanding of the multifaceted nature of poverty and its far-reaching implications.

Poverty is not merely a lack of financial resources; it is a complex phenomenon that manifests itself in various forms, including limited access to education, healthcare, clean water, and sanitation. It is a vicious cycle that perpetuates itself across generations, hampering human development and undermining the potential of individuals and communities. Breaking this cycle requires a holistic and multidimensional approach that addresses the root causes and systemic barriers that perpetuate poverty.

JICA's efforts are guided by the recognition that eradicating poverty is not only a moral imperative but also a critical driver of sustainable development. Poverty alleviation is intrinsically linked to economic growth, social stability, and environmental sustainability. By empowering individuals and communities to overcome poverty, we contribute to the realization of other SDGs, such as quality education, good health and well-being, and decent work and economic growth.

Our interventions are tailored to the specific contexts and needs of the communities we serve, employing a comprehensive approach that encompasses capacity building, infrastructure development, and policy reform. We work closely with local stakeholders, leveraging their knowledge and expertise to ensure that our initiatives are culturally sensitive and have a lasting impact.

In rural areas, where poverty is often deeply entrenched, JICA supports sustainable agricultural practices, promoting climate-resilient farming techniques and facilitating access to markets. We invest in rural infrastructure, such as roads, irrigation systems, and storage facilities, enabling smallholder farmers to increase their productivity and income. Moreover, we prioritize the empowerment of women, who often bear a disproportionate burden of poverty, by providing them with access to resources, training, and decision-making processes.

In urban settings, our focus is on creating economic opportunities and improving living conditions. We support vocational training programs that equip individuals with marketable skills, enabling them to secure decent employment and break the cycle of intergenerational poverty. Additionally, we collaborate with local authorities to upgrade informal settlements, providing access to basic services, such as clean water, sanitation, and affordable housing.

Furthermore, JICA recognizes the critical role of social protection systems in mitigating the impacts of poverty and building resilience against shocks and stresses. We collaborate with governments to develop and strengthen social safety nets, ensuring that the most vulnerable segments of society have access to essential services and resources, even during times of crisis.

Underpinning our efforts is a strong commitment to data-driven decision-making and evidence-based policies. We leverage cutting-edge research and analysis to inform our strategies and interventions, ensuring that they are grounded in empirical evidence and best practices. Additionally, we prioritize monitoring and evaluation, continuously assessing the impact of our initiatives and making necessary adjustments to enhance their effectiveness.

Through our multifaceted approach, JICA is not only contributing to the achievement of SDG 1 but also laying the foundation for sustainable and inclusive development. We recognize that eradicating poverty is a long-term endeavor that requires sustained efforts and collaboration among various stakeholders. By fostering partnerships with governments, civil society organizations, and the private sector, we leverage collective resources and expertise to amplify our impact and ensure that no one is left behind.
