Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 1 (No Poverty), written from the perspective of renowned economist Drew Fudenberg:

Poverty remains one of the most enduring and pernicious challenges facing humanity. As we approach the halfway point of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, it is imperative that we accelerate progress toward the formidable but attainable goal of eradicating extreme poverty in all its forms. This paper examines the multidimensional nature of poverty through the lens of game theory and mechanism design, proposing a novel framework for incentivizing sustainable, inclusive economic growth.

The poverty trap paradigm has long shaped our understanding of underdevelopment dynamics. Countries mired in poverty face a self-reinforcing cycle of low productivity, inadequate public and private investment, and institutional deficiencies that stifle innovation and entrepreneurship. Breaking this vicious circle requires carefully calibrated interventions that crowd in resources and create virtuous cycles.

A key insight from mechanism design is that well-structured incentives can shape individual behavior toward socially desirable outcomes. We must design international aid architectures, domestic fiscal policies, and public-private partnerships that align private returns with society's goal of poverty reduction. Strategies could include conditional cash transfers contingent on human capital accumulation, market-based solutions to provide access to credit and insurance, and results-based financing models.

However, poverty is not merely an economic condition but a deprivation of basic capabilities. Overcoming it requires a holistic approach addressing health, education, gender equality, and environmental sustainability. Sen's capabilities framework illuminates how sociocultural constraints and market failures perpetuate intergenerational transmission of disadvantage. Social protection floors, universal access to essential services, and inclusive institutional reform must complement economic empowerment.  

Game theory reveals the tragedy of the commons inherent in unchecked environmental degradation and climate change, which disproportionately impact the global poor. A stable climate represents a global public good requiring international cooperation, instituted via carefully designed cross-country incentive structures. Carbon pricing, technology transfers, and climate finance mechanisms could realign countries' incentives toward sustainable development pathways.

Moreover, civil conflict exacerbates poverty through human, physical, and institutional devastation. Negotiation analysis indicates that credible outside intervention to enforce peace agreements, bolstered by economic dividends from cooperation, can shift warring parties' incentives away from violence toward compromise. Economic interdependence binds their fortunes together. 

In sum, ending poverty requires pragmatic behavioral interventions at multiple levels - households, communities, nations, and the world. Rigorous application of cutting-edge economic frameworks can elucidate dominant strategies, mechanism constraints, and equilibrium dynamics. Only through innovative design of aligned incentive structures can we bend the arc of human welfare toward the eradication of poverty's tenacious grasp.
