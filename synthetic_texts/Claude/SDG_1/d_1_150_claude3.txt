Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 1 (No Poverty), written from the perspective of the conservative political analyst Mona Charen:

The Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty (SDG 1) is a noble and worthwhile aim, but one that must be pursued in a way that upholds core tenets of economic freedom, limited government, and personal responsibility. While well-intentioned, many current anti-poverty efforts embrace an overly broad definition of poverty, unsustainable expansions of the welfare state, and misguided wealth redistribution schemes. A more effective and ethical approach emphasizes promoting economic growth, reducing burdensome regulations, incentivizing work, and empowering the private sector as the real engine of poverty alleviation.

There is no question that true destitution—lack of basic nutrition, clean water, shelter, and access to education and healthcare—represents a moral crisis that civilized nations must work to address. However, we must avoid the intellectual sleight-of-hand that redefines poverty as any household failing to attain a subjective middle-class lifestyle. This definitional legerdemain is a stalking horse for massive government interventions that hamper economic dynamism and individual initiative.

The bitter experience of the "War on Poverty" in the United States illustrates the futility of top-down bureaucratic solutions. Despite over $25 trillion in federal spending since 1964, poverty rates have remained stagnant. A blizzard of means-tested welfare programs has undermined self-reliance, eroded family structures, and created multigenerational dependency. Unsustainable government debt has hamstrung economic vitality. The soaring costs of healthcare, education, and housing result from misguided policies, not inadequate handouts.

The real poverty success stories, from the postwar economic miracles of Germany and Japan to the modern rise of China and India, have been powered by free market reforms that unleashed the entrepreneurial abilities and industriousness of their populations. By lowering barriers to business formation, securing property rights, enabling free trade, and letting market signals allocate resources, countries have lifted millions from dire want through broad-based economic growth. Not through the top-down mandates of bureaucrats, but the bottom-up dynamism of innovators and job creators.

Those committed to eradicating severe poverty should advocate an opportunity agenda of economic freedom. This means eliminating stifling regulations that protect cronies and coddle inefficiency. It means opening markets to vibrant competition and securing dependable property rights and rule of law—key ingredients that attract investment, creating sustainable jobs and income mobility. It means replacing the demotivating web of welfare programs with targeted, strictly temporary assistance that incentivizes self-sufficiency. And it means empowering the real Seeds of Hope—the entrepreneurs, innovators, educators, and community leaders on the front lines.

Rather than perpetuating the cynical myth that poverty persists due to lack of redistributive policies, we must face the hard truth that many well-intentioned anti-poverty programs have been wasteful, ineffectual, and lamentably prone to corruption. It is time to reject the soft bigotry of low expectations and trust in the industriousness, ingenuity, and drive of human beings to elevate themselves to economic self-sufficiency when freed from restraints. The path to truly eradicating devastating poverty lies not in top-down redistribution, but in nurturing the institutional groundwork for broad-based economic growth and human flourishing driven by free people in free markets. That is the ethos we must bring to SDG 1.
