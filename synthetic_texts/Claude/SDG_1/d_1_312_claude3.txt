Agência Brasileira de Cooperação takes immense pride in presenting this analytical report on the progress and challenges associated with Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1) – No Poverty. As a nation renowned for its vibrant cultural tapestry and rich biodiversity, Brazil remains acutely aware of the intrinsic link between poverty alleviation and sustainable development.

The multidimensional nature of poverty in Brazil demands a holistic approach that transcends mere economic metrics. While the country has experienced significant strides in reducing income poverty, with the proportion of the population living below the national poverty line declining from 25.5% in 2004 to 9.3% in 2019, pockets of deprivation persist. These manifest in limited access to essential services, inadequate housing conditions, and the perpetuation of intergenerational poverty cycles.

Brazil's efforts to combat poverty have been bolstered by flagship programs such as Bolsa Família, a conditional cash transfer initiative that has benefited millions of families. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing vulnerabilities, underscoring the need for more robust and resilient social protection systems. The pandemic's economic fallout has disproportionately affected informal workers, women, and marginalized communities, threatening to reverse hard-won gains.

Addressing poverty in Brazil necessitates a multifaceted approach that spans economic empowerment, access to quality education and healthcare, and the promotion of inclusive and sustainable livelihoods. The country's commitment to SDG 1 is evident in its embrace of the "Brazil Without Extreme Poverty" strategy, which aims to lift millions out of destitution through targeted interventions and capacity-building initiatives.

Notably, Brazil's efforts extend beyond its borders, as it actively participates in South-South cooperation initiatives to share best practices and foster regional collaboration. The country's leadership in initiatives such as the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries (CPLP) and the Brazil-Africa Cooperation Program for Agricultural Development (Prosavana) underscores its dedication to global poverty eradication efforts.

However, challenges persist. The pervasive inequalities in Brazil, exacerbated by racial, gender, and geographic disparities, demand concerted efforts to address structural barriers and promote inclusive growth. The country's vast territorial expanse, coupled with its diverse socio-economic landscapes, poses logistical challenges in ensuring equitable access to opportunities and services.

Moreover, the intricate relationship between poverty, environmental degradation, and climate change cannot be overlooked. Brazil's rich natural resources, including the Amazon rainforest, are essential not only for the well-being of local communities but also for the global ecological balance. Sustainable resource management and the promotion of resilient livelihoods for indigenous and traditional communities are imperative for long-term poverty alleviation.

As Brazil navigates these complexities, it must embrace innovative approaches that harness the potential of technology, public-private partnerships, and community-driven initiatives. Empowering local communities, fostering entrepreneurship, and promoting sustainable agriculture and renewable energy solutions can catalyze transformative change.

In conclusion, Brazil's pursuit of SDG 1 is a testament to its unwavering commitment to creating a more equitable and prosperous society. By addressing the multidimensional drivers of poverty, promoting inclusive growth, and fostering regional and global cooperation, Brazil has the potential to inspire and contribute to the global fight against poverty, leaving no one behind.
