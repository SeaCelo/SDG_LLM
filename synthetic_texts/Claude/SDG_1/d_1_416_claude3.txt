As a global authority on aging and older person's rights, HelpAge International is deeply invested in the successful implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with a particular focus on SDG 1: "End poverty in all its forms everywhere." Poverty remains a pervasive and multidimensional challenge disproportionately affecting older populations worldwide, necessitating a comprehensive and age-inclusive approach to eradicate this scourge.

Poverty in old age is a complex and intersectional issue, exacerbated by factors such as gender inequalities, lack of access to healthcare and social protection systems, and the cumulative effects of discrimination and marginalization throughout the life course. In many low- and middle-income countries, a significant proportion of older persons live in extreme poverty, subsisting on less than $1.90 per day. This dire situation is compounded by the absence of universal social pensions, leaving older individuals without a reliable source of income and vulnerable to economic shocks and health crises.

The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the precarious situation of older persons living in poverty. Lockdowns and movement restrictions have disrupted informal income-generating activities, while simultaneously increasing healthcare costs and limiting access to essential services. Furthermore, the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on older populations has highlighted the urgent need for robust and inclusive social protection systems that can provide a buffer against such shocks.

Addressing poverty in old age requires a multifaceted approach that tackles the underlying drivers and reinforcing factors. One crucial aspect is the promotion of decent work opportunities throughout the life course, enabling individuals to accumulate savings and contribute to social security systems. This includes addressing gender-based discrimination in the labour market and promoting equal opportunities for women, who often face greater barriers to economic empowerment.

Additionally, the establishment of universal and non-contributory social pensions is a crucial step towards ensuring income security for older persons. These pensions not only provide a reliable source of income but also have a multiplier effect, benefiting entire households and communities. Evidence from countries such as Bolivia, Lesotho, and Namibia has demonstrated the positive impacts of social pensions on reducing poverty, improving health and nutrition outcomes, and fostering intergenerational solidarity.

Alongside income security, access to affordable and quality healthcare is crucial for older persons, who often face higher healthcare costs and higher risks of chronic diseases and disabilities. Universal health coverage, including long-term care services, can protect older individuals from catastrophic health expenditures and ensure they can maintain their dignity and independence as they age.

Furthermore, addressing ageism and discrimination is essential to break the cycle of poverty and marginalization experienced by older persons. Challenging negative stereotypes and promoting age-inclusive policies and practices in areas such as employment, education, and civic participation can empower older individuals and harness their contributions to society.

In conclusion, achieving SDG 1 and ending poverty in all its forms requires a concerted effort to address the specific vulnerabilities and needs of older populations. By implementing comprehensive and age-inclusive social protection systems, promoting decent work opportunities throughout the life course, ensuring access to quality healthcare, and challenging ageism and discrimination, we can pave the way for a more equitable and sustainable future for all ages.
