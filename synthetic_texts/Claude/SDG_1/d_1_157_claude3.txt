Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 1 (No Poverty), written from the perspective of Tina Dupuy:

Poverty is not just a lack of money - it's a deliberate system of oppression woven into the fabric of society. As we examine the UN's first Sustainable Development Goal of eradicating poverty in all its forms everywhere, we must reckon with the uncomfortable reality that poverty is a manufactured condition perpetuated by those in power to maintain systems of inequality and injustice.

The bitter truth is that poverty exists not because we lack resources or solutions, but because it benefits the wealthy capitalist class. By keeping a large underclass impoverished, subjugated and stripped of political and economic power, the elite are able to exploit their desperation as a limitless labor supply that can be paid starvation wages in hazardous working conditions. Poverty creates a motivated, obedient workforce too focused on mere survival to organize or revolt against the corporate monarchs who gorge themselves on the surplus value of their labor.

What's more, poverty is not equally distributed - it disproportionately impacts already marginalized groups based on race, gender, disability status and more. This is no accident. Poverty is a weapon deliberately aimed at these communities to reinforce existing hierarchies, deny empowerment and maintain systems of supremacy. From redlining practices that trap minorities in impoverished urban ghettos to the prison-industrial complex that capitalizes on criminalizing poverty itself, indigence is engineered to be inescapable for the most vulnerable.

Yet the apologizers for this broken system have the audacity to blame the poor for their oppression, wagging their fingers about irresponsible lifestyles or lack of elusive "grit." This perverse victim-blaming allows the powerful to abdicate responsibility and rationalize cruel austerity policies that gut social programs designed to lift people out of destitution. "Let them eat bootstraps," they proclaim from their ivory towers.  

To truly eradicate poverty requires more than piecemeal initiatives or charitable crumbs filtered through the bureaucracy of anti-poverty nonprofits. We must overhaul the very foundations of global capitalism that are premised on the existence of an impoverished labor class to exploit. This means dismantling the complex mechanisms that concentrate resources among a few at the expense of the many. It means democratizing access to education, living wages, healthcare, housing and these most basic elements of human dignity that are currently rationed and restricted to protect plutocratic interests.

Only by abolishing the conditions of racial, gender and economic oppression that create poverty to begin with can we hope to realize the dream of a poverty-free world. This will require mass movements energized to overthrow the entrenched power structures, oligarchies and sociopolitical hierarchies that currently condemn billions to squalor and immiseration. No more half-measures - it's time to uproot poverty by attacking the corrosive ideologies, institutions and individuals that spawn deprivation as a tool of subjugation and control.
