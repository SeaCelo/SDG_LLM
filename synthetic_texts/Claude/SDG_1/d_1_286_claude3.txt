Eradicating poverty in all its forms is an imperative of our time, one that lies at the heart of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. As we grapple with the multidimensional nature of poverty, it is crucial to recognize its inextricable link with macroeconomic stability and the propagation mechanisms through which economic shocks can perpetuate cycles of deprivation.

Drawing upon the New Keynesian paradigm, we can elucidate the intricate interplay between poverty, aggregate demand, and the propagation of business cycle fluctuations. The prevalence of poverty, characterized by low incomes and limited access to economic opportunities, constrains household consumption and investment, thereby dampening aggregate demand. This, in turn, can trigger a vicious cycle of reduced output, employment losses, and further impoverishment, exacerbating the initial shock.

Moreover, the presence of nominal rigidities, such as sticky prices and wages, can amplify the effects of demand shocks, leading to prolonged periods of economic contraction and heightened vulnerability for those already teetering on the brink of poverty. The New Keynesian framework highlights the role of monetary and fiscal policy in mitigating these adverse effects, underscoring the importance of countercyclical measures to stabilize aggregate demand and cushion the impact on the most vulnerable segments of society.

It is imperative to recognize that poverty is not merely a manifestation of transitory economic downturns but a deeply entrenched structural phenomenon, rooted in systemic inequalities, institutional failures, and persistent market imperfections. The New Keynesian model, while illuminating the propagation of macroeconomic shocks, must be complemented by a broader understanding of the structural determinants of poverty, including access to education, healthcare, productive assets, and inclusive financial systems.

In this context, the Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1) – "End poverty in all its forms everywhere" – represents a clarion call for a comprehensive and multifaceted approach, one that harnesses the synergies between macroeconomic policies, structural reforms, and targeted interventions. Achieving this goal necessitates a concerted effort to foster inclusive economic growth, strengthen social safety nets, and empower marginalized communities through access to productive resources and economic opportunities.

The implementation of SDG 1 requires a unwavering commitment to evidence-based policymaking, grounded in rigorous empirical analysis and a nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between macroeconomic dynamics, structural factors, and the lived experiences of those trapped in the grip of poverty. By integrating the insights of the New Keynesian framework with a holistic appreciation of the multidimensional nature of poverty, we can chart a path towards a more equitable and sustainable future, where the scourge of poverty is eradicated, and the inherent dignity and potential of every human being is realized.
