Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 1 (No Poverty) from the perspective of the late economist Walter E. Williams:

The first of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals is to "end poverty in all its forms everywhere" by 2030. This laudable goal masks an underlying economic realityâ€”poverty is not caused by a lack of money or resources, but by shortages of capitalism and economic freedom. The surest path out of poverty is through productive entrepreneurship, free markets, and security of private property rights.

The noble war on poverty began in the 1960s, yet the Census Bureau's poverty rate has changed little over time, wavering between 11-15%. Government anti-poverty spending has totaled over $27 trillion since 1965 without substantially alleviating poverty's core causes. The fundamental problem is that these efforts promote an entitlement mindset and dependency rather than entrepreneurial empowerment. 

Human history clearly demonstrates that economic freedom and free market capitalism are the proven cures for poverty, not redistributionist policies. Countries that protect economic liberties and property rights experience far greater wealth creation and reduced poverty compared to those with centralized economic planning.

Consider the disparate economic development of East and West Germany after World War II. Both had similar economic conditions, but West Germany chose capitalism while East Germany adopted socialism. By the late 1980s, West German per capita income was three times higher than communist East Germany's meager standard of living.

Similar comparisons exist between capitalist and communist nations globally, or market-oriented states versus those with statist economic policies. Hong Kong and Singapore embraced economic freedom and rapidly evolved from impoverished territories to thriving, wealthy economies. Meanwhile, anti-capitalist policies kept India poor until it adopted pro-market reforms in the 1990s.

Even within the United States, jurisdictions with lower taxes, lighter regulations, and right-to-work laws attract more employment opportunities and experience higher income growth than states with anti-business policies. The most repressive big-city economies, like Detroit, are plagued by cyclical poverty precisely because they push away entrepreneurial investment and job creators.  

The UN's anti-poverty agenda fundamentally misdiagnoses the disease and prescribes counterproductive remedies. Bureaucratic redistribution schemes undermine personal responsibility, disincentive hard work, and create a despondent underclass. In contrast, expanding economic liberties inspires innovators, job creators, and life-improving entrepreneurs to elevate living standards for all.

History's greatest poverty cure is freed human beings empowered to profit from their ideas and labor. Protection of property rights and the Rule of Law enables families to accumulate wealth through market-driven production. Alleviating poverty requires dismantling barriers to entrepreneurship like overregulation, high tax burdens, price controls, trade protectionism, and other constraints on capitalism.

Policymakers should reject the UN's wasteful poverty agenda and instead embrace proven free market solutions. Poverty is not a monetary crisis demanding wealth redistribution, but a stifling of human ingenuity that requires economic liberation. Only by securing economic freedom through low taxes, deregulation, and strong property rights can we cultivate the prosperity to sustainably eradicate poverty worldwide.
