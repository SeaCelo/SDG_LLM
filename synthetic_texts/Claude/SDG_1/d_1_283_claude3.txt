As an economist dedicated to understanding and alleviating global poverty, I find the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1 – "End poverty in all its forms everywhere" – to be both a moral imperative and an intellectual challenge of the highest order. Poverty is a multidimensional phenomenon, encompassing not only inadequate income but also deprivations in areas such as health, education, security, and social inclusion. Addressing it requires a comprehensive and nuanced approach that recognizes the complex interplay of economic, social, and political factors.

One of the key insights from my work, and that of my colleagues in the field of development economics, is the importance of understanding the specific contexts and constraints faced by the poor. Too often, well-intentioned policies and interventions fail to achieve their desired impact because they are based on assumptions or theories that do not align with the realities on the ground. Through rigorous empirical research, including randomized controlled trials, we have been able to identify and test interventions that can effectively alleviate poverty in different contexts.

For instance, our research has shown that providing small-scale asset transfers, such as livestock or cash grants, can have a significant and lasting impact on the economic and social well-being of ultra-poor households. By breaking the cycle of poverty and enabling these households to engage in productive activities, such interventions can set them on a path towards sustainable livelihoods. However, the success of these programs often hinges on careful design and implementation, taking into account factors such as social norms, gender dynamics, and local institutions.

Another key area of focus has been on the role of human capital development, particularly in the realms of education and health. Poverty not only deprives individuals of access to quality education and healthcare but also perpetuates intergenerational cycles of deprivation. Interventions that address barriers to school enrollment and attendance, such as conditional cash transfers or the provision of deworming medication, have been shown to have significant positive impacts on educational attainment and future earnings potential.

At the same time, we must recognize that poverty is not merely a lack of resources but also a lack of opportunity and agency. Empowering individuals and communities to participate in decision-making processes and to shape the interventions that affect their lives is crucial for ensuring sustainable and equitable development. Participatory approaches, such as community-driven development programs, have demonstrated the potential to foster ownership, build social capital, and achieve better outcomes in areas ranging from infrastructure development to natural resource management.

Addressing poverty also requires a broader reckoning with the structural inequalities and power dynamics that perpetuate marginalization and exclusion. Issues of gender, ethnicity, disability, and social status can exacerbate poverty and limit access to opportunities and resources. Policies and interventions must be designed with a keen awareness of these intersecting factors and a commitment to promoting inclusive and equitable development.

Ultimately, achieving SDG 1 will require a multifaceted and coordinated effort that spans local, national, and global scales. It will necessitate mobilizing resources and political will, fostering collaboration between diverse stakeholders, and embracing innovation and experimentation. As development economists, our role is not only to generate rigorous evidence but also to engage with policymakers, practitioners, and communities to translate that evidence into effective and context-appropriate solutions.
