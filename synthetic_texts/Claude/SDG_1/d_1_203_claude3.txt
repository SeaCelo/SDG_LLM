Here is a draft academic article about SDG 1 (No Poverty), written from the perspective of renowned writer Gene Weingarten:

The Sisyphean Struggle to End Poverty: A Tragicomic Tale

Let's start with a little humor, shall we? A poor man walks into a bar. Ouch! It was a revolving door.  

All jokes aside, the war on poverty is no laughing matter. This Sisyphean struggle has tormented humanity for millennia, much like I've tormented editors with my unpredictable prose over the years. Like the mythological figure cursed to roll a boulder uphill for eternity, our quest to vanquish destitution often feels like one step forward, two steps back. 

Poverty is the punchline nobody's laughing at. It's the comic trapped in a tragic opera. The Coyote repeatedly pulverized by the Roadrunner's acme anvils. Viewed through this absurdist lens, the statistics  are comically grim. As I write this, about 735 million people scrape by on less than $1.90 a day. That's over twice the population of the United States living on what I'd spend on a decent quartered pounder with fries.

This sobering reality sounds like a joke setup in need of a punchline: "So a guy walks into the UN general assembly and says there are 735 million poor people in the world..." But I'll spare you the lame zinger. Poverty is no joke when you're the impoverished one.

Our global efforts to combat poverty often feel as futile as the legendary Greek punishments doled out in Tartarus. We toil relentlessly, yet the rock keeps rolling back down. Two decades of focused UN efforts on poverty alleviation only dropped the rate of extreme poverty from 36% in 1990 to 10% today. Progress, sure, but a Sisyphean snail's pace. At this rate, we won't meet the stated goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030. Not even close.

So what's the punchline? How do we escape this tragic comedy? Perhaps we need to shift paradigms. Rather than treating poverty alleviation as an isolated goal, we should view it as the overarching condition for achieving sustainability across all 17 Global Goals. Poverty is both a consequence and driver of issues like hunger, poor health, lack of education, gender inequality, and environmental degradation.  

In this light, our stalled progress comports with the painfully ironic observation that "The oppressed masses are so battered down by the ruling classes, they can't get up the energy to revolt." Do the global poor simply lack the means to demand the change they desperately need?

Like many great modern comedians, I leave you not with a tidy resolution, but more disquieting questions. Perhaps that's only appropriate for such a heavy topic festooned in comical Sisyphean irony. If poverty's rock eventually does crest the hill, will it roll right back over us? Or will we seize that liberation to finally slay this ancient, absurdist foe?
