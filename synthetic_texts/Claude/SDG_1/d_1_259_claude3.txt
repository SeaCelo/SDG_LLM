Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 1 (No Poverty), written from the perspective of Emmanuel Saez, an esteemed economist and expert on inequality:

The first of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals aims to "end poverty in all its forms everywhere" by 2030. This extraordinarily ambitious objective betrays just how intractable and multidimensional the challenge of poverty remains on a global scale. Longstanding research by myself and collaborators like Thomas Piketty has extensively documented the rise of income and wealth inequality within most advanced economies over recent decades. However, focusing solely on the disparities between top earners and the rest masks an even starker divide - that of the billions trapped in absolute destitution.

While laudable strides have been made, with the World Bank citing a drop in the extreme poverty rate from 36% in 1990 to 8.6% in 2018, over 600 million people still subsist on less than $1.90 per day. This arbitrary monetary line obscures the deeper deprivations borne from lacking access to basic nutrition, clean water, sanitation, healthcare, education, and opportunity itself. Poverty is not merely a shortfall of income, but a cyclical, oppressive system impeding human capability and flourishing.

We cannot disregard the structural forces and inequities perpetuating poverty's vicious spiral. Of preeminent concern are the ways in which the very growth processes intended to reduce poverty have simultaneously fostered inequality and exclusion. As capital has become more concentrated and returns have disproportionately accrued to top earners, wealth disparities have soared. The top 1% now hold nearly two-thirds of global wealth, while the bottom 50% possess just 2%. So while GDP per capita has risen, the poorest have derived little tangible benefit as they remain disconnected from meaningful economic participation and basic public goods.    

This divergence exemplifies how averages mask underlying inequality. Any coherent poverty reduction strategy necessitates frank recognition of these disparities and their root causes. We require comprehensive policies to foster more equitable growth and ensure the poorest can partake in its gains. Bolstering worker's bargaining power through unions and wage standards, strengthening social safety nets, enhancing public investment and service provision, and critically, exploring wealth taxation measures to narrow staggering asset inequalities.

It is ultimately this exclusion from opportunity and economic, political, and social capital that traps the poorest in deprivation across generations. Breaking this cycle demands extending not merely monetary income, but human capital through access to quality education and healthcare. Poverty alleviation intrinsically hinges on empowerment, self-determination, political representation, and dismantling the structural barriers precluding the world's most vulnerable from realizing their innate potential.

Ending poverty inextricably intertwines with confronting its systemic, institutionalized drivers stemming from power asymmetries, gender discrimination, and the disproportionate impacts of conflict and climate change born by the disadvantaged. The fragility traversing poverty's dynamics underscores poverty as a human rights crisis in dire need of a unified, evidence-based, yet fundamentally moral response. Economic prosperity and societal advancement ring hollow without a concerted global commitment to upholding the dignity and opportunity for all people to thrive.
