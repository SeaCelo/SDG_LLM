The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) recognizes the multidimensional nature of poverty and the complex interplay of factors that contribute to its persistence. Eradicating poverty in all its forms remains one of the greatest challenges of our time, and SDG 1 serves as a beacon, guiding our efforts to address this pressing issue.

Within the EBRD's regions of operation, pockets of entrenched poverty persist, often exacerbated by conflicts, economic shocks, and environmental degradation. Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that goes beyond mere income measures and targets the underlying drivers of poverty.

One of the key strategies employed by the EBRD is promoting inclusive economic growth through private sector development. By fostering an enabling environment for businesses to thrive, we aim to create sustainable employment opportunities and stimulate economic activity in marginalized communities. This involves supporting entrepreneurship, improving access to finance, and enhancing workforce skills through vocational training programs.

However, economic growth alone is not sufficient. We recognize the need for robust social protection systems that act as a safety net for the most vulnerable segments of society. Investing in resilient healthcare systems, quality education, and affordable housing is paramount to breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty.

Moreover, the EBRD acknowledges the disproportionate impact of poverty on women and marginalized groups, including ethnic minorities, persons with disabilities, and displaced populations. Our interventions prioritize gender equality and social inclusion, promoting equal access to economic opportunities, resources, and decision-making processes.

Climate change and environmental degradation pose significant threats to poverty eradication efforts. The EBRD is committed to promoting sustainable practices and investing in climate-resilient infrastructure, ensuring that vulnerable communities are better equipped to withstand and adapt to the impacts of climate change.

Collaboration with governments, civil society organizations, and international partners is crucial in this endeavor. The EBRD leverages its expertise and financial resources to support policy reforms, strengthen institutional capacities, and foster cross-border cooperation in addressing shared challenges.

While progress has been made, significant challenges remain. Conflicts, political instability, and economic crises continue to undermine poverty reduction efforts in many regions. The EBRD remains steadfast in its commitment to building resilience and promoting sustainable development, recognizing that eradicating poverty is not only a moral imperative but also a prerequisite for lasting peace, prosperity, and global stability.

Through a multifaceted approach that addresses the root causes of poverty, promotes inclusive growth, and fosters resilience, the EBRD is dedicated to realizing the vision set forth by SDG 1, leaving no one behind in our collective pursuit of a more equitable and prosperous world.
