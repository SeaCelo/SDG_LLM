Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 1 (No Poverty), written from the perspective of Jug Suraiya in his characteristic witty and thought-provoking style:

The Poverty Paradox: When "No Poverty" is Not Enough

By Jug Suraiya  

If the Sustainable Development Goals were an eccentric millionaire's last will and testament, SDG 1 - "No Poverty" - would be the troublesome but favored heir who got the lion's share of the old man's fortune. Of the 17 SDG goals adopted by the United Nations, it is this first one which has been allocated the largest portion of funding and accorded the greatest urgency of implementation. 

The logic behind this pecking order is unassailable. Poverty is the primal curse, the zombie virus which immobilizes its victims and turns them into armies of the living dead. It is both a precipitant and a consequence of all other deprivations - lack of healthcare, education, opportunity, empowerment. Breaking the cycle of poverty is hence the key to unlocking doors to progress in every other sphere.

And yet, somewhat paradoxically, merely eliminating poverty is the least that the world's have-lots owe to the world's have-nots. The real challenge posed by SDG 1 is the excruciatingly definitive "No" that it places before the noun "Poverty."

It's an improbably sweeping negation, leaving no room for ambiguity or exception. Whereas most if not all the other SDGs come with caveats - "Quality Education," "Affordable Clean Energy," "Decent Work and Economic Growth," and so on - the first goal states its aim in that blunt, absolutist style favored by totalitarian dictatorships and the writers of banner headlines.

No Poverty. Not some poverty. Not even a little, itsy-bitsy poverty. None whatsoever.

It's a tall order, particularly when posed against the backdrop of existing socio-economic disparities which have historically obtained across different cultures, and which continue to be perpetuated, even exacerbated, in our age of turbo-charged globalization.  

How does one realistically set about achieving this Ã¼ber-ambitious objective? Not to put too fine a point on it, but the challenge of eliminating poverty (in the sense of extreme deprivation) is far more manageable than that of eliminating poverty as an overarching socio-economic condition, a permanent underclass status shared intergenerationally by a significant segment of the populace.

To explain: There have been any number of piecemeal initiatives, from microfinance schemes to the provision of basic civic amenities and targeted income subsidies, which have succeeded in somewhat mitigating the harsh material circumstances of the very poor. Such measures have helped lift millions of souls out of what is described as "extreme poverty" - encompassing the having to endure hunger, lack of shelter, or absence of the bare rudiments of sanitation and healthcare.

But moving the poverty-ridden out of extreme poverty still leaves them trapped in a cycle of relative poverty: wanting in access to opportunities of sustainable livelihood; unable to marshal resources towards asset creation; and socially marginalized by reasons of caste or ethnicity or gender bias. In many societies, this condition of systemic poverty has been endemic for centuries, passed down from generation to generation like some pernicious heirloom. 

Ending this insidious legacy is what the first SDG commits the global community to doing. The target is to achieve zero poverty of any sort, absolute or relative, by 2030. With the deadline just six years away, we are nowhere close to even visualizing what a completely poverty-free world would look like, let alone having a roadmap to realize that Utopian ideal.

The skeptic is likely to see SDG 1 as a classic example of what was once cynically described as "poverty porn" - a delusion peddled by international aid agencies to those who can afford the luxury of idealistic excess. Why aim for the impossible when there is so much that can realistically and pragmatically be done to help the very poor to help themselves?

It is a valid critique. And yet, humanity's greatest leaps forward have often been precipitated by the pursuit of seemingly unreachable goals. "Zero poverty" as an ambition may turn out to be a mirage. But in striving for that mirage, we may eventually reach an oasis of relative wellbeing yet unglimpsed by earlier generations.

As that great poet of paradox, Robert Browning wrote: "A man's reach should exceed his grasp/ Or what's a heaven for?"
