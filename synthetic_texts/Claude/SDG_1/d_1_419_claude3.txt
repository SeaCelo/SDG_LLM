ICLEI's report on Sustainable Development Goal 1 (No Poverty) highlights the pivotal role of local governments in eradicating poverty in all its forms. This multidimensional challenge demands a holistic approach that addresses not only income poverty but also lack of access to essential services, productive resources, and social protection systems.

Our analysis underscores the interplay between poverty and urbanization, as rapid urban growth often outpaces the capacity of cities to provide adequate housing, infrastructure, and economic opportunities. Informal settlements, characterized by substandard living conditions, inadequate access to basic services, and lack of tenure security, perpetuate the cycle of poverty and vulnerability. Local governments must prioritize inclusive urban planning, slum upgrading programs, and the provision of affordable housing to create an enabling environment for poverty reduction.

Addressing poverty requires a strong emphasis on sustainable livelihoods and inclusive economic growth. Local governments play a pivotal role in promoting entrepreneurship, supporting micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), and fostering an enabling environment for decent work and economic empowerment. Initiatives such as skill development programs, access to microfinance, and the creation of inclusive value chains can unlock economic opportunities for marginalized communities.

Moreover, our report highlights the importance of social protection systems tailored to local contexts. Local governments, in collaboration with national authorities and civil society organizations, can design and implement targeted social assistance programs, including cash transfers, in-kind support, and access to affordable healthcare and education. These initiatives not only provide a safety net but also contribute to human capital development, breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty.

Climate change and environmental degradation exacerbate poverty, disproportionately impacting the most vulnerable communities. Local governments must prioritize climate resilience and disaster risk reduction strategies, integrating poverty reduction efforts with sustainable natural resource management and ecosystem preservation. Initiatives such as community-based adaptation, climate-smart agriculture, and green infrastructure not only enhance resilience but also create livelihood opportunities.

Effective poverty reduction requires a collaborative and inclusive approach, engaging local communities, civil society organizations, and the private sector. Participatory decision-making processes, community-driven development initiatives, and public-private partnerships can foster ownership, leverage local knowledge, and ensure that interventions are tailored to the specific needs and aspirations of marginalized groups.

Our report emphasizes the importance of monitoring and evaluation frameworks that go beyond income-based indicators to capture the multidimensional aspects of poverty. Local governments should adopt disaggregated data collection and analysis, ensuring that no one is left behind and that progress is tracked across various socioeconomic groups and geographic areas.

In conclusion, local governments are at the forefront of the fight against poverty, with a unique opportunity to implement context-specific, integrated, and inclusive strategies. By leveraging their proximity to communities, local knowledge, and collaborative networks, they can drive transformative change and accelerate progress towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 1.
