The Saudi Fund for Development, as a prominent development finance institution, recognizes the urgency of addressing poverty in all its forms as a fundamental human rights issue and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development. Our commitment to Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1) – No Poverty – is unwavering, and we adopt a multidimensional approach to tackle this complex challenge.

Our efforts are centered on fostering inclusive economic growth, creating decent employment opportunities, and promoting social protection systems. We prioritize investments in rural development, agriculture, and small-scale entrepreneurship, acknowledging the critical role these sectors play in alleviating poverty, particularly in developing countries. By supporting sustainable agricultural practices, improving access to markets, and enhancing value chains, we aim to increase the productivity and incomes of smallholder farmers, a significant portion of whom live in extreme poverty.

Furthermore, we recognize the importance of addressing the root causes of poverty, such as inequality, discrimination, and limited access to essential services. Our initiatives focus on empowering marginalized groups, including women, youth, and persons with disabilities, through targeted interventions in education, healthcare, and skill development. By fostering human capital and enhancing their economic prospects, we strive to break the intergenerational cycle of poverty.

In line with the SDG 1 targets, we prioritize the implementation of nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures, including floors. Our financing supports the establishment and expansion of social safety nets, such as cash transfer programs, social assistance schemes, and contributory social insurance systems. These interventions not only provide a buffer against economic shocks and vulnerabilities but also promote human dignity and enable individuals to invest in their future.

Moreover, we acknowledge the intrinsic link between poverty eradication and climate change mitigation and adaptation. The adverse impacts of climate change disproportionately affect the poor and exacerbate existing vulnerabilities. Consequently, our interventions incorporate climate-resilient strategies, promoting sustainable livelihoods, and enhancing the adaptive capacity of communities to cope with climate-related shocks and disasters.

Recognizing the multidimensional nature of poverty, we adopt a comprehensive approach that encompasses economic, social, and environmental dimensions. Our investments prioritize infrastructure development, access to affordable and clean energy, and the promotion of sustainable cities and communities. By fostering an enabling environment for inclusive growth and resilient societies, we aim to create lasting positive impacts and contribute to the achievement of SDG 1 and the broader 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

Through strategic partnerships with governments, multilateral organizations, civil society, and the private sector, we leverage our resources and expertise to maximize our impact. Our operations are guided by the principles of transparency, accountability, and inclusive decision-making, ensuring that our interventions are responsive to local needs and aligned with national development priorities.

As we navigate the complexities of poverty eradication, we remain steadfast in our commitment to innovation, continuous learning, and evidence-based policymaking. By harnessing the power of data and leveraging cutting-edge technologies, we strive to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of our interventions, ensuring maximum impact on the ground.

The Saudi Fund for Development recognizes that eradicating poverty is not only a moral imperative but also a necessary condition for achieving sustainable development, promoting global peace and stability, and unlocking the full potential of individuals and societies. We remain resolute in our commitment to SDG 1, working tirelessly to create a world where no one is left behind, and the dignity and rights of all are upheld.
