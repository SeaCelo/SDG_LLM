The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) presents this analytical report on the progress and challenges surrounding Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1): End poverty in all its forms everywhere. 

Despite significant strides in recent decades, poverty remains a pervasive and multidimensional issue. While the global poverty rate has declined from 35.9% in 1990 to 8.6% in 2018, an estimated 689 million people still live in extreme poverty, surviving on less than $1.90 a day. This figure is deeply concerning, and the COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the situation, pushing an additional 119-124 million people into poverty in 2020 alone.

Poverty is not merely a lack of income; it is a deprivation of essential human capabilities, encompassing health, education, access to basic services, and social exclusion. In this context, addressing SDG 1 requires a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach that addresses both income poverty and multidimensional poverty.

One of the primary challenges in eradicating poverty is its entrenched and self-perpetuating nature. Poverty is often intergenerational, with children born into impoverished households facing significant barriers to breaking the cycle. Limited access to quality education, healthcare, and opportunities for economic advancement can trap families in a vicious cycle of deprivation. Furthermore, the impacts of poverty are not evenly distributed, with women, children, indigenous populations, and marginalized groups disproportionately affected.

Addressing income poverty requires sustained economic growth, job creation, and social protection measures. Developing countries must prioritize inclusive and sustainable economic policies that promote decent work opportunities, particularly in sectors with high potential for poverty reduction, such as agriculture, manufacturing, and services. Investing in human capital through education and healthcare is crucial for empowering individuals and communities to participate fully in the economy.

However, income alone is not a panacea for poverty alleviation. Multidimensional poverty requires a holistic approach that addresses deprivations in health, education, housing, and other essential aspects of well-being. Ensuring access to quality healthcare services, clean water, and sanitation facilities is vital for improving living standards and overall human development.

Combating poverty also necessitates addressing structural inequalities and systemic barriers. Inclusive and participatory governance, strong institutions, and policies that promote equality and non-discrimination are essential for creating an enabling environment for poverty reduction. Empowering marginalized groups, particularly women and indigenous populations, through targeted interventions and initiatives that foster social inclusion is crucial for achieving sustainable and equitable progress.

Moreover, climate change and environmental degradation pose significant threats to poverty alleviation efforts. Poor communities are often disproportionately affected by natural disasters, resource depletion, and environmental degradation, which can undermine their livelihoods and exacerbate existing vulnerabilities. Integrating climate resilience and environmental sustainability into poverty reduction strategies is imperative for ensuring long-term progress and mitigating the adverse impacts of climate change on the most vulnerable populations.

In conclusion, eradicating poverty in all its forms requires a multifaceted and coordinated approach that addresses both income and multidimensional deprivations. Sustained economic growth, job creation, and social protection measures must be complemented by investments in human capital, access to essential services, and policies that promote equality and social inclusion. Addressing structural inequalities, empowering marginalized groups, and integrating climate resilience and environmental sustainability are crucial for achieving sustainable and equitable progress towards SDG 1.
