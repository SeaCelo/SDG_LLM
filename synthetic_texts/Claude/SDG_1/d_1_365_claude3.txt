The global effort to eradicate poverty in all its forms – SDG 1 – represents a fundamental human imperative and a prerequisite for achieving the wider 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. As an intergovernmental organization at the forefront of this goal, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) recognizes the multidimensional nature of poverty, encompassing not only income deprivation but also limited access to nutritious food, clean water, education, healthcare, and other essential services.

Addressing rural poverty remains a critical priority, as an estimated 79% of the world's poor reside in rural areas, heavily dependent on agriculture, forestry, and fisheries for their livelihoods. Smallholder farmers, pastoralists, and artisanal fisherfolk are particularly vulnerable to economic shocks, climate change impacts, and market fluctuations, perpetuating cycles of poverty and food insecurity. The FAO's interventions in this domain span various fronts, including promoting sustainable agricultural practices, facilitating access to productive resources (such as land, inputs, and financing), enhancing market linkages, and strengthening social protection systems.

One notable initiative is the Farmer Field School approach, which empowers smallholder farmers through participatory learning and capacity-building, enabling them to adopt climate-smart technologies, optimize yields, and improve household resilience. Furthermore, the FAO's Respecting Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) framework safeguards the rights of indigenous peoples, ensuring their active involvement in decision-making processes that impact their lands, territories, and resources.

Urban poverty is also a pressing challenge, with an estimated 25% of the global urban population living in slums or informal settlements, lacking access to adequate housing, sanitation, and basic services. The FAO's Food for the Cities programme advocates for an integrated approach to urban food systems, fostering sustainable production, processing, distribution, and consumption of nutritious foods within and around urban areas. This paradigm shift not only enhances food security and nutrition but also generates employment opportunities and fosters social inclusion.

Cross-cutting issues such as gender equality, youth empowerment, and climate change adaptation are intrinsically linked to poverty eradication efforts. The FAO's Gender Strategy recognizes the disproportionate impact of poverty on women and girls, advocating for equal access to productive resources, opportunities, and decision-making processes. Simultaneously, the organization's Youth Strategy aims to harness the potential of young people as agents of change, fostering their engagement in sustainable agriculture, entrepreneurship, and leadership roles.

Addressing the root causes of poverty necessitates a holistic, multi-sectoral approach that transcends traditional siloes. The FAO actively collaborates with various stakeholders, including governments, civil society organizations, private sector entities, and development partners, to leverage synergies and amplify impact. For instance, the Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMA) initiative supports countries in developing and implementing climate-smart agriculture practices, simultaneously contributing to poverty reduction, food security, and climate change mitigation.

While substantial progress has been made in reducing global poverty rates, significant challenges persist, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, conflicts, and the escalating climate crisis. The FAO remains steadfast in its commitment to eradicating poverty through innovative, scalable, and context-specific interventions that prioritize the most vulnerable populations. Leveraging its technical expertise, global partnerships, and evidence-based approaches, the organization continues to pioneer sustainable solutions that harmonize economic growth, social equity, and environmental sustainability, ultimately fostering resilient and prosperous communities worldwide.
