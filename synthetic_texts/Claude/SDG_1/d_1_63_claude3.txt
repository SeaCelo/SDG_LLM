Here is a detailed, comprehensive response on SDG 1 (No Poverty) written as an academic article by Gwynne Dyer:

Poverty Amid Plenty: A Scar on the Human Conscience 

By Gwynne Dyer

At the dawn of the 21st century, humanity finds itself at a paradoxical crossroads. Despite stupendous advances in technology, productivity, and aggregate global wealth, a staggering portion of our species still wallows in the direst destitution. It is an obscenity writ large upon the fabric of our civilization that in this age of plenty, millions upon millions languish in a sunless netherworld of penury and privation.

The statistics are damning: nearly half the world's population, a full 3.4 billion souls, subsist on less than $5.50 per day. Over 700 million people, concentrated primarily in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, are classified as living in 'extreme poverty' on less than $1.90 per day. Numbers that should induce visceral moral revulsion in any sentient being.

Yet this mass destitution is not some inevitable natural calamity, but a grotesque socioeconomic distortion manufactured by humankind itself. An artificial crisis born of rapacious greed, entrenched structural inequalities, and a hideous indifference to the wretched of the earth. We are not facing a scarcity but a grossly skewed maldistribution of resources in an obscenely unequal world where the 26 richest individuals own as much wealth as the poorest 50% of humanity.  

The consequences of this stain upon our species are visceral and manifest. Poverty is a hellish, multifaceted cyclone that devastates human lives and fractures whole societies. It propels severe malnutrition that stunts both bodies and minds. It denies hundreds of millions of children the fundamental human right of education, perpetuating generational poverty cycles. It decimates already fragile public health profiles and exacerbates the spread of preventable diseases. The desperate poor, shorn of all economic opportunity, are frequently forced into hazardous labor, human trafficking rings, or conscripted as child soldiers.

In the endless numbing cascade of conflicts erupting across the global boulevards these days, poverty is all too often the malign primordial seed. As destitute and marginalized masses lack any stakeholding in the prevailing order, they become fertile recruiting grounds for extremist ideologies, insurgencies and civil strife. We erect ever more virulent strains of political and religious fanaticism upon the cankered foundations of poverty.

And ultimately, perhaps most cynically tragic of all, the immiseration of the world's poor is both a cause and amplifier of environmental degradation. With their existences teetering on the razor edge of subsistence, the poor are often forced to decimate the very natural resource base they rely upon for survival. A vicious downward spiral culminating in spreading deserts, deforestation, poisoned rivers and the extinction of biodiversity.  

In an era of looming climate catastrophe and soaring eco-system collapse, no remotely sustainable model for human civilization can endure amid such mass deprivation of nearly a quarter of our species. As we bear witness to rising sea levels, blistering droughts and crop failures, climate apartheid looms as a potentially apocalyptic reality that will sort the human race into the anointed and the damned along familiar equatorial lines.

The moral case for eradicating poverty is limpid and unambiguous. It is quite simply the sine qua non of the very enterprise of civilization itself. A world of opulence amidst destitution fails the most rudimentary ethical test humanity has constructed for itself. For what perverse vanity project is the human apotheosis in science, culture and philosophy if it merely buys our species the dubious prestige of being the first bipedal life form to master astrophysics while simultaneously leaving a quarter of its rank to putrefy in squalor?   

But even from a crass pragmatic self-interest calculation, poverty immiserates us all. Beyond its dehumanizing indignities and structural violence, it is a fetid cancer whose mutant cells metastasize into terrorism, conflict, uncontrolled mass migration, organized crime syndicates, and festering eco-catastrophe. In sum, it is the primordial inflammatory disorder from which all of humanity's other pathologies erupt in flaming symptomatic fury.   

The solutions are hardly exotic or beyond the civilizational remit of contemporary human potentiality. Although particular circumstances vary nationally and regionally, the core strategic components are clear: Aggressive investment in public health, nutrition, education and social safety nets to vitiate those diabolical reinforcing cycles. Bottom-up development paradigms emphasizing participatory local economic empowerment, micro-lending and agricultural extension services for smallholders. Strategic emphasis on universal provision of modern contraception, female empowerment and gender equality as poverty's most implacable long-term solution. 

Above all, an unwavering universal commitment to slashing income disparities through redistributive fiscal policies funded by wealth taxes and closure of tax havens. The ultimate impetus rests upon the determined collective will to excise the grotesque human malignancy of poverty once and for all through a decisive reordering of economic architectures and social priorities. 

The abolition of poverty is the inescapable apotheosis towards which the entire promethean project of civilization inexorably churns. For in the final existential analysis, any species able to decipher the fundamental syntaxes of its own cosmos yet unable to erase the primal pestilence of poverty is not merely brutalized but patently incomplete. We remain unfinished tinkerers in our own workshop, an imperfect species squandering its own capacious potentiality for higher actualization.
