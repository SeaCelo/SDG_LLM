Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 1 (No Poverty) from the perspective of Judith Sloan, written in an authoritative and opinionated style:

The Grand Fantasy of the Sustainable Development Goals

By Judith Sloan, Economist and Leading Commentator

The first of the much-vaunted Sustainable Development Goals seeks to "end poverty in all its forms everywhere" by 2030. This wildly ambitious, some might say delusional, aspiration represents an extreme overreach by the United Nations and global development bureaucrats. In essence, they are seeking to legislate away an immutable feature of the human condition – the reality that relative poverty will always exist, no matter how prosperous a society becomes.

Let's start with some definitional issues. The UN considers someone living in extreme poverty if they subsist on less than $1.90 per day. This arbitrary income-based benchmark fails to account for differences in costs of living across regions and countries. It ignores critical non-income factors like access to basic services, quality housing, life expectancy, and subjective wellbeing metrics. Poverty is a complex, multi-dimensional phenomenon that cannot simply be reduced to a crude dollar figure.

Even using the UN's flawed yardstick, history shows that rapid poverty reduction, while possible, is the exception rather than the rule. Only a handful of nations like China have managed to lift hundreds of millions out of extreme poverty in recent decades through pragmatic, market-oriented reforms. Most developing countries remain mired in vicious cycles of low growth, poor governance, corruption, and internal conflicts – factors perpetuating systemic poverty.  

The hubris of SDG 1 is to assume that throwing more foreign aid at the problem can meaningfully accelerate this tortuous process. Aside from the moral hazard of unconditional cash transfers, there is scant evidence that ballooning overseas development assistance has acted as a catalyst for economic and social advancement. Too often, aid props up rent-seeking regimes and generates dependence rather than self-sustaining growth. Ask yourself: if foreign aid truly reduced poverty, shouldn't the problem have been solved already given over $1 trillion disbursed annually?       

Instead of lofty but empty sloganeering, the UN would be better served adopting more modest, localized targets focused on improving access to basic health, education, and infrastructure in the world's most impoverished communities. Making poverty more "bearable" in the short-term while incentivizing policies that create economic opportunities is a pragmatic first step before embarking on a quixotic quest to completely eradicate it.

Some well-meaning commentators argue that modern technologies like artificial intelligence, renewable energy and biotechnology could theoretically help eliminate poverty if applied through the right policy frameworks. This profoundly underestimates the real-world challenges of implementation, not to mention affordability constraints for the world's poor. Innovations that accelerate productivity and growth may exacerbate income inequalities in the short-run before gradually diffusing more widely.  

In any case, aiming to eliminate all poverty is a Sisyphean task given the proclivities of human nature. Even among wealthy developed nations like Australia, poverty persists in relative terms as societal benchmarks of affluence rise over time. As economist John Kenneth Galbraith observed: "People are poverty-stricken when their income, even if adequate for survival, falls radically behind that of the community."

This is the central conceit of SDG 1: the false notion that poverty is an economic condition that can be eradicated through top-down targets, foreign aid budgets, and technocratic policy interventions.  Rather, poverty is an inherent characteristic of free societies with disparate individual talents and choices. Trying to completely equalize outcomes is a fool's errand that can only lead to the equal impoverishment of all.

A more grounded approach would acknowledge the stubborn persistence of relative poverty while seeking to reliably uplift each community's least well-off through sustainable, wealth-creating policies. This path may lack idealistic zeal, but it represents a pragmatic roadmap for meaningful developmental progress. Anything else is simply utopian dreaming destined to remain an NBS (Never Been Successful) indicator to be revisited at the next grand conclave of global bureaucrats.
