As one of the foremost authorities on child welfare and advocacy, UNICEF has long been at the forefront of global efforts to eradicate poverty in all its forms. Our unwavering commitment to Sustainable Development Goal 1 – "End poverty in all its forms everywhere" – is rooted in the fundamental understanding that poverty is not merely a lack of financial resources, but a multidimensional deprivation that robs children of their basic rights and impedes their ability to reach their full potential.

Despite remarkable progress in recent decades, the scourge of poverty continues to cast its shadow over the lives of far too many children worldwide. According to our latest estimates, nearly one in four children – a staggering 689 million – are currently living in households that subsist on less than $3.20 per day. This harsh reality is compounded by the devastating impacts of climate change, conflict, and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, all of which have exacerbated existing inequalities and pushed millions more into destitution.

UNICEF's approach to tackling child poverty is guided by a holistic, child-centered perspective that recognizes the intersectionality of poverty with other critical issues such as health, education, nutrition, and protection. Our interventions are grounded in a rights-based framework that prioritizes the best interests of the child and upholds the principles of non-discrimination, participation, and accountability.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, where over half of all children live in extreme poverty, our efforts have focused on strengthening social protection systems and ensuring access to essential services. For instance, in Ethiopia, our flagship Productive Safety Net Program has provided cash transfers and public works employment to millions of households, helping to mitigate the impacts of drought and food insecurity while promoting investments in children's education and health.

In South Asia, where rapid economic growth has coexisted with stubbornly high levels of child poverty, our initiatives have targeted the underlying drivers of marginalization and exclusion. In India, our interventions have centered on empowering marginalized communities, such as the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, through targeted cash transfers, skill development programs, and capacity-building initiatives.

Recognizing the disproportionate burden of poverty on children with disabilities, UNICEF has also prioritized inclusive programming and advocacy efforts to ensure that no child is left behind. In partnership with governments and civil society organizations, we have worked to dismantle barriers to education, health care, and social services, while promoting inclusive policies and practices that respect the dignity and rights of children with disabilities.

Furthermore, UNICEF has been at the forefront of efforts to address the unique vulnerabilities faced by children in humanitarian contexts. Through our robust emergency response mechanisms, we have provided lifesaving assistance to children and families affected by conflict, natural disasters, and other crises, ensuring their access to basic necessities such as food, water, shelter, and protection.

As we look to the future, UNICEF remains steadfast in its commitment to ending child poverty in all its forms. We recognize that achieving this ambitious goal will require a concerted global effort, involving governments, civil society, the private sector, and communities themselves. It will demand not only increased investments in social protection systems and essential services but also a fundamental shift in mindsets and power dynamics that perpetuate inequality and marginalization.

Through our evidence-based advocacy, technical expertise, and on-the-ground programming, UNICEF will continue to be a powerful voice for the world's most vulnerable children, championing their rights and ensuring that they have the opportunities and resources they need to thrive. By addressing the root causes of child poverty and promoting inclusive, sustainable development, we can build a world where every child has the chance to reach their full potential, regardless of their circumstances.
