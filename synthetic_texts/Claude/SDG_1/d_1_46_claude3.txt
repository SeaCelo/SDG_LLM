Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 1 (No Poverty) from the perspective of Nick Cater:

The Mirage of Sustainable Development Goal 1: A Neoliberal Agenda Masquerading as Poverty Alleviation

By Nick Cater

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have been hailed as a transformative and ambitious agenda to tackle the world's most pressing socioeconomic and environmental challenges. Among these 17 interlinked objectives, SDG 1 aims to "end poverty in all its forms everywhere" by 2030. On the surface, this appears a noble and humanitarian pursuit. However, upon scrutinizing the underlying ideologies and proposed implementation strategies, it becomes evident that SDG 1 is a thinly veiled attempt to entrench the neoliberal economic paradigm under the guise of altruism.

The blueprint for achieving SDG 1 rests on perpetuating the same market fundamentalist policies that have exacerbated poverty and inequality over the past decades. It champions privatization, deregulation, fiscal austerity, and the unbridled primacy of corporate interests â€“ the very forces that have concentrated wealth in the hands of a rapacious global elite while immiserating billions. By repackaging these discredited nostrums as a roadmap to poverty reduction, the UN has fallen victim to the insidious machinations of the wealthy oligarchs who control the levers of global capitalism.

At its core, the SDG framework embraces the flawed premise that economic growth, spurred by corporations unfettered from regulatory "burdens," will inevitably uplift the impoverished masses through the beneficent forces of trickle-down economics. This narrative conveniently absolves the capitalist system of its structural propensity to exploit labor and natural resources in the relentless pursuit of profit maximization. It obfuscates the reality that poverty is not an accidental market failure, but rather an endemic feature of an economic model predicated on the consolidation of capital and the immiseration of the working class.

The proponents of SDG 1 disingenuously tout "pro-poor" growth policies, ostensibly aimed at empowering marginalized communities through increased market access and financial inclusion. However, this rhetoric merely cloaks the insidious intent to absorb these populations into the neoliberal extractivist model as a reservoir of cheap labor and a captive market for the west's surplus commodities. It perpetuates the skewed power dynamics that have historically enriched the global north at the expense of the exploited global south.

Moreover, the SDG agenda's emphasis on public-private partnerships represents a brazen attempt to grant multinational corporations even greater influence over the policymaking processes that should serve the public interest. By positioning these profit-driven behemoths as pivotal stakeholders in the implementation of SDG 1, the UN has effectively ceded sovereignty to the corporate leviathans that have consistently prioritized shareholder returns over the welfare of the world's most vulnerable populations.

Rather than alleviating poverty, SDG 1 threatens to exacerbate it by doubling down on the very economic orthodoxies that have perpetuated stark inequalities and undermined the livelihoods of the global poor. It co-opts the rhetoric of social justice to provide a veneer of legitimacy to an agenda that ultimately serves the interests of the wealthy elite at the expense of the dispossessed masses.

To truly eradicate poverty, we must transcend the myopic confines of the neoliberal paradigm and embrace a radical redistribution of wealth and power. Only by dismantling the structural impediments embedded within the capitalist system and empowering marginalized communities to reclaim sovereignty over their economic destinies can we forge an equitable and sustainable future for all.
