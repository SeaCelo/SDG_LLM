Here is a draft academic article on SDG 1 (No Poverty), written from the perspective of Nobel laureate economist Jean Tirole:

The first of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals aims to "end poverty in all its forms everywhere" by 2030. Poverty is not only a vast moral tragedy, depriving billions of people of dignity and opportunity, but an immense economic inefficiency and market failure as well. The persistence of poverty represents one of the greatest wastes of human potential in our world today.  

As an economist deeply concerned with incentives, institutions, and the healthy functioning of markets, I believe poverty must be understood as arising from an equilibrium of dysfunctional incentives and constraining circumstances that perpetuate deprivation. The poor face inherent challenges in access to education, healthcare, finance, property rights, and economic opportunities - handicaps that systemically make it more difficult to invest in human capital and increase future earnings potential. Meanwhile, the non-poor face insufficient incentives to facilitate the inclusion of the poor as full economic citizens.

The first-best solution from the standpoint of economic theory is straightforward: provide a temporary "big push" of resource transfers and investments to the poor to allow them to overcome barriers and integrate into well-functioning, competitive markets. With this jumpstart, the poor could invest in their human capital, occupations, businesses, and acquire the means to generate sustainable income streams. They could become full participants in societal cooperation and economic exchange.

However, implementation challenges abound. Difficulties arise in targeting the intended beneficiaries, minimizing adminstrative costs and corruption, creating effective delivery channels, accounting for environmental externalities, and more. My work has demonstrated that even when contracting parties have a mutual interest in cooperation, underinvestment can persist due to commitment issues, bargaining problems, and fears of post-contractual holdup. These "institutional" market failures bedevil development efforts.

Yet there are grounds for cautious optimism. Social enterprises, NGOs, public-private partnerships, and innovative financing schemes are pioneering new ways to fight poverty while respecting incentive constraints. Developments in mechanism design are enabling better targeting. Leveraging individual motivation and harnessing the forces of reciprocity through community-based approaches have shown promise. Innovations in financial instruments and mobile banking are expanding access to credit and savings for the poor.  

Rigorous empirical research and field experiments are crucial to test which reforms have the most positive and cost-effective impacts. We must identify scalable policies and programs adhering to robust incentive principles - advancing mutual economic interests rather than relying solely on altruism or coercion. Multidisciplinary collaborations between economists, policymakers, businesses, and NGOs working directly in specific communities are the most promising route to make transformative progress on this SDG within the ambitious timeframe.

Ending poverty is not only a moral imperative but an immense economic opportunity. Integrating currently marginalized populations more fully into robust, inclusive markets would unleash a vast underutilized reservoir of human potential, dynamically expanding the fertile innovation ecosystem that drives economic progress. The continual refinement of effective poverty interventions, guided by rigorous economic reasoning and fieldwork, must be an urgent priority for our global community in the decades ahead.
