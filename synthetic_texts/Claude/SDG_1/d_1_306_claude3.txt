Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 1 (No Poverty), written from the perspective of economist Rafael La Porta:

The first of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals is the noble, yet enormously challenging objective of ending poverty in all its forms everywhere by 2030. As an economist who has dedicated his career to understanding the institutional determinants of economic development, I am inclined to approach this goal through the lens of policy choices, incentive structures, and their impacts on poverty levels across countries.

At its core, poverty is an economic condition characterized by a severe deprivation of income and lack of access to basic goods and services necessary for dignified living. However, poverty is not solely an outcome, but is intrinsically linked to deep-rooted institutional factors that create or perpetuate this deprived state. My research has consistently highlighted the paramount importance of secure property rights, effective contract enforcement, and constraints on elite power and expropriation as key enablers of long-term economic development and poverty reduction.

Countries mired in poverty tend to exhibit legal systems that fail to provide adequate protection of property rights for the masses. When property ownership is insecure, individuals and firms face diminished incentives to invest in productive activities that could lift them out of poverty. Furthermore, ineffective contract enforcement raises transaction costs and impedes the development of sophisticated markets, further suppressing economic opportunities for the poor.

Perhaps even more pernicious is the influence of elite capture and the exploitation of state powers by privileged groups and individuals. In dysfunctional institutional environments, economic rents flow disproportionately to politically connected elites, who use their influence to extract resources from the broader population. This rent extraction perpetuates poverty by limiting economic mobility and access to productive resources for the less affluent segments of society.

Overcoming these institutional deficiencies requires comprehensive legal and regulatory reforms aimed at creating a level playing field and promoting economic freedom for all citizens. Countries that have successfully reduced poverty, such as many East Asian nations, have implemented policies that secure property rights, strengthen the rule of law, and open up economic opportunities to the broader populace.

However, such reforms are often fiercely resisted by entrenched interests benefiting from the status quo. Overcoming this resistance necessitates a delicate balance of incentives and political will to dismantle the institutional foundations that enable rent-seeking behavior and elite capture. International organizations and aid agencies can play a crucial role in providing technical assistance, monitoring, and incentives for countries to undertake these difficult but essential reforms.

Ultimately, the goal of eradicating poverty is not merely a matter of cash transfers or short-term stopgap measures. It requires a fundamental restructuring of the institutional framework within which economic activities take place. By securing property rights, enforcing contracts impartially, and dismantling the mechanisms that enable elite expropriation, countries can unlock the productive potential of their citizens and pave the way for broad-based economic development that lifts millions out of poverty.

This is an arduous and politically contentious undertaking, but one that is imperative for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and fostering a more just and prosperous world order.
