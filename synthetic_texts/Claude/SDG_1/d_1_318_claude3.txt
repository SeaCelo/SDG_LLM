The Egyptian Agency for Partnership for Development (EAPD) recognizes that eradicating poverty in all its forms remains one of the greatest challenges facing our nation and the global community. Despite significant strides in recent years, persistent poverty continues to undermine human dignity, hamper economic growth, and exacerbate social tensions.

Egypt's commitment to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1 – End Poverty in All Its Forms Everywhere – is unwavering. Our multi-faceted approach encompasses a range of targeted interventions aimed at addressing the multidimensional nature of poverty.

Through our flagship "Poverty Alleviation and Livelihoods Enhancement" (PALE) initiative, we have prioritized the empowerment of marginalized communities, particularly those residing in rural areas and informal urban settlements. By leveraging innovative public-private partnerships, PALE provides access to microfinance opportunities, vocational training, and entrepreneurship support. This holistic approach equips individuals with the necessary skills and resources to break the intergenerational cycle of poverty and establish sustainable livelihoods.

Recognizing the inextricable link between poverty and social protection, EAPD has spearheaded the expansion of Egypt's social safety net programs. The "Takaful and Karama" initiative, a pioneering conditional cash transfer scheme, has proven instrumental in alleviating the financial burdens of impoverished households. Through targeted financial assistance contingent upon children's school enrollment and regular health check-ups, we are fostering human capital development while mitigating the immediate impacts of poverty.

Furthermore, our agency has prioritized addressing the disproportionate impact of poverty on women and girls. The "Women's Economic Empowerment Program" (WEEP) offers tailored training, mentorship, and access to financial services, empowering women to become agents of change within their communities. By promoting gender equality and economic inclusion, we are not only advancing SDG 1 but also contributing to the achievement of SDG 5 – Gender Equality.

In recognition of the inextricable link between poverty and environmental degradation, EAPD has integrated sustainable development principles into our poverty alleviation strategies. Our "Green Jobs Initiative" equips youth from disadvantaged backgrounds with the skills necessary to participate in the burgeoning green economy, fostering economic opportunities while promoting environmental sustainability.

Collaboration and partnerships are central to our approach. EAPD actively engages with civil society organizations, academic institutions, and international development agencies to leverage collective expertise and resources. Through initiatives such as the "Poverty Mapping and Data Analytics Platform," we harness the power of data-driven decision-making to identify pockets of poverty, target interventions effectively, and monitor progress.

While significant challenges persist, EAPD remains steadfast in its commitment to eradicating poverty in Egypt. Our comprehensive strategies, rooted in evidence-based policymaking and inclusive stakeholder engagement, are yielding tangible results. By fostering economic empowerment, strengthening social protection systems, promoting gender equality, and embracing sustainable development principles, we are paving the way for a future where no Egyptian is left behind.
