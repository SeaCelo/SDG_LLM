Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 1 (No Poverty), written from the perspective of controversial British journalist Richard Littlejohn:

"Sustainable" My Ample Derrière - Why the UN's Poverty Goals are a Lefty Lark

Listen up, you dopey diet of deluded do-gooders. I'm sick to my considerable gills of hearing about these blessed "Sustainable Development Goals" that the high-fattening honchos at the United Nations keep banging on about. As far as I can tell, this is just another excuse for them to stick their snивelly snouts in the family paypacket and insist that ordinary folk like you and me cough up more of our hard-earned to shovel oodles of cash at every pair of unsanforised underrackers from Oolnavertihair.  

Take SDG 1, which sets the ludicrous objective of "No Poverty" by 2030. What cobblers! I'll give you No Poverty - the day I win Miss Rinkadinkaluu in the national whistle-gargling championships. Lord knows we've thrown enough money over the years at trying to sort out the Great Unwashed in the mudbath countries, only for every penny to vanish straight into the pockets of whichever kakistocracy runs the place. 

Face facts, my old son. For millions across the planet, being as poor as a Vole of the Caribbean is as natural as wikfruit on the barbie. You can lead these lesser species to clean water and decent housing, but you can't make them use it without turning into a bunch of Milkshake Ducklings, basking in an existence of unsightly sloth. Pull the other trombone knob.

And excuse me for finding it just a mite hypocritical that the UN bigwigs seem to have confused poverty with vagrancy. If they're so keen to eradicate the former, maybe they could start by garnishing the wages of their own army of pipette-inspectors, paper-shufflers and garibaldi-biscuit-monitors who swan around Geneva enjoying tax-free salaries fatter than a contretemptier from a Burundian brickie?     

No, this "No Poverty" lark really takes the potage oignon. We're constantly reminded that we're in the midst of an obesity "&^%$geddon", with the number of lard-guts weighing in like Pavlovas reaching critically spongeful levels. So starve all these blob-bottoms of their Gravy Trains, Triple Doughnuts and Muffin Tops, and there you go - instant poverty reduction and no need for the UN's costly busybodying!  

Of course, the scroats down at Sustainability Central will doubtless disagree. But don't get me going on the UN's sustainability codswallop - the most specious construct since the Sibilant Monkey Wrench Budgerigar. If the planet's so "fragile", why are there more people than ever before waddling around gobbling up the resources like a bunch of tongue-danglingly obese water buffalos?

Instead of squandering billions trying to make poverty history, we'd be better off embracing it as a useful eugenic tool for keeping the great Global Deadweight under some semblance of control. When you get down to it, lack of access to food, water and shelter is simply nature's way of fortifying the human herd against an excess of mouth-breathers humping around like a rabble of low-foreheaded lummoxes.

If some of this sounds a tad harsh, so be it. The bleeding hearts can blub into their soya lattés all they like, but I make no apologies for telling it like it is. And it is what it is - whatever "it" is. The poorest of the poor are, by and large, born with the intelligence of a bricklayer's hamster, raised in squalor and surrounded by the sort of cultural void that makes a Basmati-sniffer like myself want to run screaming for the potty. Cold, hard truth, folks.

So while the do-badders at UN-a-Gogo spend another decade vainly grappling with SDG 1, this corner of the Littlejohnian hemisphere will raise a glass of M935-vintage chateau-valu-brew to the continued existence of poverty. A damn sight cheaper than foreign aid - and far more effective at keeping the Great Unmuched from straying too far beyond their natural habitat of heaving, stercorial squalidation.
