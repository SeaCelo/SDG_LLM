Light for the World presents a comprehensive analytical report on the current status and challenges faced in achieving Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1): "End poverty in all its forms everywhere." Poverty remains a persistent and multidimensional challenge, with complex and interrelated causes and consequences that require a holistic and integrated approach.

Globally, the number of people living in extreme poverty, defined as living on less than $1.90 per day, has declined significantly in recent decades. However, progress has been uneven across regions and countries, and the COVID-19 pandemic has reversed some of these gains. According to the World Bank, the pandemic pushed an additional 97 million people into extreme poverty in 2020, exacerbating existing inequalities and vulnerabilities.

Poverty is not just a lack of income; it manifests in various forms, including lack of access to education, healthcare, clean water, sanitation, and decent work opportunities. These deprivations perpetuate a vicious cycle of poverty, undermining human capabilities and limiting the potential for sustainable development. For instance, in sub-Saharan Africa, where poverty rates remain highest, limited access to quality education and healthcare has far-reaching consequences for human capital development, productivity, and economic growth.

Addressing poverty requires a comprehensive approach that targets its root causes and addresses the intersectionality of various factors. Efforts must focus on promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth, investing in human capital development, strengthening social protection systems, and empowering marginalized and vulnerable groups, including women, children, persons with disabilities, and indigenous populations.

Achieving SDG 1 necessitates a concerted effort to create decent work opportunities and promote sustainable livelihoods. This involves fostering an enabling environment for entrepreneurship, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and investing in infrastructure and sustainable agricultural practices. Initiatives such as providing access to affordable credit, technical training, and market linkages can empower individuals and communities to break the cycle of poverty.

Furthermore, addressing poverty requires a comprehensive approach to tackling inequality and promoting social inclusion. This involves implementing progressive taxation policies, strengthening social protection systems, and promoting equal access to essential services, including healthcare, education, and basic infrastructure. Investments in early childhood development, quality education, and vocational training can help break intergenerational cycles of poverty and foster human capital development.

Climate change and environmental degradation also exacerbate poverty, particularly in developing countries where communities rely heavily on natural resources for their livelihoods. Promoting sustainable management of natural resources, investing in climate-resilient infrastructure, and supporting adaptation and mitigation strategies are crucial for protecting vulnerable populations and ensuring long-term poverty reduction efforts.

Achieving SDG 1 requires a collaborative effort involving governments, civil society organizations, the private sector, and international development partners. Effective governance, transparency, and accountability are essential for ensuring that policies and programs effectively target and reach the most vulnerable populations. Partnerships and multi-stakeholder engagement can leverage diverse expertise, resources, and innovative solutions to accelerate progress towards ending poverty in all its forms.

In summary, ending poverty requires a multidimensional and integrated approach that addresses the complex and interrelated causes and consequences of poverty. By promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth, investing in human capital development, strengthening social protection systems, empowering marginalized groups, and addressing environmental challenges, we can make significant strides towards achieving SDG 1 and creating a more equitable and prosperous world for all.
