The Asia-Pacific region has made significant strides in addressing poverty, with the proportion of people living in extreme poverty declining from 53.9% in 1990 to 7.1% in 2015. However, progress has been uneven across and within countries, and the region remains home to over 400 million people living in extreme poverty, accounting for nearly a third of the global total. Additionally, multidimensional poverty, which considers deprivations in health, education, and living standards, remains a persistent challenge, with nearly one in four people in the region classified as multidimensionally poor.

Achieving Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1) – "End poverty in all its forms everywhere" – requires a comprehensive and multifaceted approach that addresses both income poverty and non-income dimensions of deprivation. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing vulnerabilities, with an estimated 89 million people in the Asia-Pacific region falling into extreme poverty in 2020 due to the economic fallout of the crisis.

To combat poverty effectively, a multidimensional approach is essential, addressing not only income poverty but also access to basic services, social protection, and sustainable livelihoods. This involves strengthening social protection systems, investing in human capital through quality education and healthcare, promoting inclusive economic growth, and building resilience to shocks and disasters.

One of the critical challenges in the region is the prevalence of informality in the labor market, which often leaves workers without access to social protection or decent working conditions. Policies aimed at formalizing the informal sector, such as streamlining business registration processes, promoting entrepreneurship, and providing incentives for formalization, can contribute to reducing poverty and increasing access to social protection.

Furthermore, the Asia-Pacific region is highly vulnerable to natural disasters and the impacts of climate change, which can have devastating consequences for the poor and exacerbate existing vulnerabilities. Building resilience through adaptive social protection systems, climate-smart agriculture, and investments in disaster risk reduction is crucial to safeguarding gains made in poverty reduction and ensuring sustainable development.

Addressing poverty also requires a concerted effort to promote inclusive economic growth that creates decent employment opportunities and fosters economic diversification. This involves investing in infrastructure, promoting sustainable industrialization, and fostering an enabling environment for private sector development, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are critical drivers of job creation.

Moreover, targeted interventions are needed to address the specific vulnerabilities of marginalized groups, such as women, children, persons with disabilities, and ethnic minorities, who often face multiple and intersecting forms of deprivation. This may involve enhancing access to education, healthcare, and productive resources, as well as promoting inclusive policies and addressing discriminatory social norms and practices.

Effective implementation of SDG 1 also necessitates strengthening data collection and monitoring systems to better understand the multidimensional nature of poverty and track progress towards reducing it. This includes improving the availability and quality of disaggregated data, which is essential for identifying and targeting vulnerable groups and designing tailored interventions.

In conclusion, eradicating poverty in all its forms remains a formidable challenge for the Asia-Pacific region, but one that is critical for achieving sustainable development. A comprehensive and integrated approach that addresses both income poverty and non-income dimensions of deprivation, while fostering inclusive economic growth, building resilience, and promoting social inclusion, is essential. Sustained political commitment, robust financing mechanisms, and enhanced regional cooperation will be pivotal in ensuring that no one is left behind on the path to a more prosperous and equitable future for the Asia-Pacific region.
