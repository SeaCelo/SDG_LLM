The United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) herein presents an in-depth analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1): End poverty in all its forms everywhere. Poverty remains a pervasive global challenge, afflicting billions and hindering social, economic, and environmental progress. UNIDO recognizes that industrial development, if pursued strategically and sustainably, can be a powerful driver for poverty eradication and inclusive economic growth.

Poverty manifests in multidimensional formsâ€”inadequate income, lack of access to basic services, vulnerability to shocks and disasters, discrimination, and social exclusion. Addressing these interconnected deprivations requires a comprehensive approach integrating economic, social, and environmental dimensions. Industrialization, particularly in developing countries, can create employment opportunities, generate income, and facilitate access to essential goods and services, directly impacting poverty reduction.

However, traditional industrial models have often prioritized profit over social and environmental considerations, leading to unsustainable practices that exacerbate inequality, degrade the environment, and perpetuate poverty cycles. UNIDO advocates for an inclusive and sustainable industrial development (ISID) framework that harmonizes the three pillars of sustainable development: economic growth, social equity, and environmental protection.

Under the ISID approach, UNIDO supports member states in developing inclusive and sustainable industrial policies, promoting green industries, fostering entrepreneurship and micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), and facilitating technology transfer and innovation. These efforts aim to create decent employment opportunities, enhance productivity and competitiveness, and promote sustainable consumption and production patterns, thereby contributing to poverty alleviation.

For instance, UNIDO's Productive Work for Youth and Migration joint programme in Ethiopia, funded by the Italian Agency for Development Cooperation, has provided skills training and entrepreneurship support to over 5,000 youth, enabling them to establish sustainable livelihoods and escape poverty cycles. Similarly, UNIDO's Eco-Industrial Park (EIP) initiative in Vietnam has promoted resource efficiency, cleaner production, and industrial symbiosis, resulting in economic benefits for participating industries while mitigating environmental degradation and fostering sustainable development in local communities.

Achieving SDG 1 necessitates a collaborative effort involving governments, civil society, the private sector, and international organizations. UNIDO partners with stakeholders to strengthen national and regional capacities, promote public-private partnerships, and facilitate knowledge-sharing and technology transfer, ensuring no one is left behind in the pursuit of sustainable industrial development.

Addressing poverty aligns with and reinforces progress towards several other SDGs, underscoring the interconnected nature of the 2030 Agenda. Eradicating poverty directly contributes to SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) by enhancing food security and nutrition. Poverty reduction also impacts SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) by improving access to healthcare and reducing vulnerability to diseases. Furthermore, SDG 1 intersects with SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), as inclusive industrialization creates employment opportunities and fosters economic development.

Looking ahead, UNIDO will continue to prioritize inclusive and sustainable industrial development as a catalyst for poverty eradication. Leveraging innovation, multi-stakeholder partnerships, and tailored interventions, UNIDO aims to support member states in achieving SDG 1 while contributing to the overall 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
