World Accord International Development Agency presents a comprehensive analysis of the global progress and challenges associated with Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1): "End poverty in all its forms everywhere."

Despite substantial strides in poverty reduction over the past decades, the COVID-19 pandemic has reversed much of this progress, exacerbating existing inequalities and vulnerabilities. According to the World Bank, the pandemic pushed an additional 120 million people into extreme poverty in 2020, representing the first increase in global poverty rates since 1998. This setback underscores the fragility of poverty eradication efforts and the need for renewed commitment and innovative strategies.

Multidimensional poverty, which considers deprivations beyond income, such as lack of access to education, healthcare, and basic services, remains a persistent challenge, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. In these regions, entrenched structural barriers, including conflict, weak governance, and limited access to economic opportunities, perpetuate intergenerational cycles of poverty.

Climate change and environmental degradation pose significant threats to poverty alleviation efforts, disproportionately impacting the poorest and most vulnerable communities. Extreme weather events, such as droughts, floods, and hurricanes, can devastate livelihoods, destroy assets, and exacerbate food insecurity, pushing millions into poverty annually.

The agency's analysis highlights the need for a comprehensive and multidimensional approach to poverty eradication, addressing not only income poverty but also the underlying causes of social and economic marginalization. Effective strategies must prioritize:

1. Inclusive economic growth and job creation: Fostering inclusive and sustainable economic opportunities, particularly in rural areas and for marginalized groups, is crucial. This includes promoting entrepreneurship, investing in human capital development, and supporting smallholder farmers and informal sector workers.

2. Social protection systems: Robust and adaptive social protection mechanisms, such as cash transfers, public works programs, and social insurance schemes, can provide a critical safety net, mitigating the impacts of shocks and enabling households to invest in their future.

3. Access to quality education and healthcare: Ensuring equitable access to quality education and healthcare services is essential for breaking intergenerational poverty cycles and enabling individuals to reach their full potential.

4. Empowerment and participation: Empowering the poor and ensuring their meaningful participation in decision-making processes is vital for designing and implementing effective poverty reduction strategies that address their specific needs and challenges.

5. Climate resilience and environmental sustainability: Integrating climate adaptation and environmental sustainability measures into poverty reduction efforts is crucial to safeguarding livelihoods and reducing vulnerability to future shocks.

6. Strengthening governance and institutions: Effective governance, strong institutions, and the rule of law are critical for creating an enabling environment for poverty reduction and ensuring that resources and services reach those most in need.

The agency's report emphasizes the need for a coordinated global effort involving governments, civil society, the private sector, and international organizations. It calls for increased investments in poverty eradication, innovative financing mechanisms, and the use of data and technology to better target interventions and monitor progress.

Eradicating poverty in all its forms is not only a moral imperative but also a prerequisite for achieving sustainable development, promoting social cohesion, and ensuring global stability. By addressing the root causes of poverty and empowering the most vulnerable, we can build a more just and equitable world, leaving no one behind.
