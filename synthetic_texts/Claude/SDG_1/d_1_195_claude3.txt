Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 1 (No Poverty), written from the perspective of conservative commentator Cal Thomas:

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by the United Nations is an ambitious plan to address humanity's most pressing challenges. However, the first Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 1) to "end poverty in all its forms everywhere" embodies a fundamentally flawed and misguided approach. While poverty alleviation is a noble cause, the secular progressive vision underlying SDG 1 betrays a humanistic worldview detached from spiritual truths and historical wisdom.

The materialistic concepts driving SDG 1 are rooted in the idea that wealth redistribution and an expanded welfare state are viable solutions to poverty. However, this paradigm fails to recognize the deeper cultural and moral underpinnings of poverty. Throughout history, the most effective paths out of destitution have stemmed from cultivating an ethic of hard work, personal responsibility, strong family structures, and faith in God.  

Time-honored Judeo-Christian values espousing human dignity, charity, and the Golden Rule provided the foundations for societal progress that lifted millions out of poverty. In stark contrast, the secular neo-Marxist ideology animating SDG 1 naively presumes that bureaucratic income transfers and government edicts can permanently solve what is ultimately a spiritual deficiency.

The Western nations exhibiting the highest levels of prosperity today grew their economies not through wealth taxes and regulatory encroachment, but by upholding the rule of law, protecting private property rights, and allowing free enterprise to flourish. These capitalistic principles rewarded innovation and incentivized entrepreneurial risk-taking in ways that generated sustainable economic growth and opportunity.

On the other hand, many developing countries mired in systemic poverty today have fallen victim to the siren song of collectivism and centralized economic control. From the destructive socialist experiments of the 20th century to the present-day scourge of runaway public sector corruption, these nations provide cautionary tales of what happens when individual liberty and market economics are subjugated.  

Rather than doubling down on the failed big government policies that breed dependence and stifle upward mobility, the world should look to the proven principles that formed the bedrock of the most prosperous civilizations. These include stable democracy, limited government, strong civil society institutions, and a moral cultural renaissance that restores the importance of faith, family, and self-reliance.

The United Nations and the European social democracies funding this agenda would be wise to heed the lessons from America's founding spirit of rugged individualism and self-determination. It was this ethos of human potential, coupled with Calvinist Protestant ethics, that propelled the American experiment into a land of unparalleled opportunity and economic abundance.

In essence, SDG 1 epitomizes the civilizational crossroads at which humanity finds itself. On one side, we have a path that upholds the transcendent values and liberating principles that unleashed human flourishing in the first place. On the other, we have a path of secular progressivism and bureaucratic control that, despite good intentions, leads inexorably toward the squandering of prosperity and human potential.

For the sake of the world's most vulnerable populations trapped in cycles of poverty and despair, it is paramount that we eschew the materialistic vision of the SDG agenda. Instead, we must reembrace the spiritual and moral foundations that proved indispensable to eradicating privation throughout previous eras of hardship. It is only through this reinvigorated commitment to our better virtues that humanity can achieve true sustainable liberation from poverty's shackles.
