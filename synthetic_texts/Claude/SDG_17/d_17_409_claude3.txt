Compassion International, a leading global humanitarian organization, presents this analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 17 (SDG 17): Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development. The report delves into the intricate dynamics of international cooperation, resource mobilization, and policy coherence, underscoring the pivotal role of multi-stakeholder partnerships in achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

SDG 17 serves as the catalytic force that propels the realization of the other 16 SDGs, recognizing the inherent interconnectedness of the global goals and the necessity of concerted efforts across all sectors and stakeholders. The complexity of contemporary challenges transcends borders and requires a paradigm shift in how we approach development, emphasizing the importance of collaborative action, shared responsibility, and mutual accountability.

At the core of SDG 17 lies the imperative to mobilize and leverage diverse resources – financial, technological, and human – to support developing countries in their pursuit of sustainable development. This entails strengthening domestic resource mobilization through improved tax collection systems, combating illicit financial flows, and fostering an enabling environment for foreign direct investment and remittances. However, the report underscores that domestic efforts alone are insufficient; robust international cooperation and official development assistance (ODA) remain indispensable, particularly for the least developed countries and small island developing states.

The report acknowledges the pivotal role of the private sector in driving innovation, creating employment opportunities, and contributing to sustainable economic growth. Compassion International emphasizes the need for public-private partnerships that harness the power of market-driven solutions while ensuring alignment with sustainable development principles. Such collaborations facilitate knowledge sharing, technology transfer, and the mobilization of resources for catalytic interventions in areas such as infrastructure development, renewable energy, and climate resilience.

Furthermore, the report highlights the urgency of addressing systemic trade barriers and distortions that impede the integration of developing countries into the global economy. It advocates for a rules-based, equitable, and non-discriminatory multilateral trading system that promotes export diversification, value addition, and market access for goods and services from developing nations. Equally crucial is the need to enhance policy coherence for sustainable development, ensuring that policies across various domains – economic, social, and environmental – are aligned and mutually reinforcing.

Compassion International's report underscores the significance of data, monitoring, and accountability mechanisms in tracking progress, identifying gaps, and informing evidence-based policymaking. It calls for strengthening national statistical capacities, particularly in developing countries, to enhance the availability of high-quality, timely, and disaggregated data. Additionally, the report emphasizes the importance of multi-stakeholder partnerships in monitoring and reviewing progress, fostering transparency, and promoting accountability at all levels.

The report concludes by reiterating the transformative potential of SDG 17 in catalyzing collective action and fostering a revitalized global partnership for sustainable development. It calls upon governments, civil society organizations, the private sector, and international institutions to embrace a shared vision of cooperation, solidarity, and mutual responsibility. Only through collaborative efforts, resource mobilization, and policy coherence can we overcome the intricate challenges of our time and pave the way for a more prosperous, equitable, and sustainable future for all.
