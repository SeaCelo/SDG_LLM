The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 17, Partnerships for the Goals, serves as the linchpin of the entire 2030 Agenda, underpinning and catalyzing progress across all other SDGs. At the World Food Programme (WFP), we recognize the pivotal role of collaborative multi-stakeholder partnerships in achieving Zero Hunger (SDG 2) and addressing the root causes of food insecurity.

Enhancing global partnerships has been a strategic priority for the WFP, as the complexity and interconnectedness of challenges demand collective action. We have forged diverse alliances with governments, civil society organizations, academia, and the private sector, harnessing their unique competencies and resources to maximize impact.

One notable initiative is our collaboration with the African Development Bank to establish the Africa Drone and Data Al Institute. This public-private partnership aims to leverage cutting-edge technologies like drones and artificial intelligence for more efficient and effective humanitarian responses, optimizing food and aid delivery in hard-to-reach areas plagued by conflict or natural disasters.

Another innovative partnership is the Sustainable Rice Landscapes initiative, a multi-stakeholder platform involving governments, research institutions, and private companies. This initiative promotes sustainable rice production practices that enhance food security, mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, and preserve biodiversity, demonstrating the interconnections between SDGs 2, 13, and 15.

Recognizing the importance of mobilizing financial resources, the WFP has engaged in novel fundraising partnerships. Our ShareTheMeal mobile app, developed in collaboration with the private sector, enables individual donors worldwide to provide nutritious meals to those in need with a few taps on their smartphones. This innovative approach harnesses the power of technology and global connectivity to catalyze grassroots support for SDG 2.

Furthermore, the WFP has prioritized partnerships with local and indigenous communities, acknowledging their invaluable traditional knowledge and understanding of sustainable food systems. In the Plurinational State of Bolivia, we have collaborated with indigenous communities to revive and promote the cultivation of neglected and underutilized nutrient-rich crops, bolstering food security, preserving biodiversity, and empowering local livelihoods.

Effective partnerships require robust data-sharing mechanisms, policy coherence, and alignment of interventions. To this end, the WFP has actively engaged in global platforms like the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data, fostering knowledge exchange, capacity building, and coordinated efforts to strengthen national statistical systems and data ecosystems.

Moving forward, we anticipate an increased emphasis on South-South and triangular cooperation, leveraging the experiences and expertise of countries that have successfully implemented sustainable food systems. Additionally, we foresee greater engagement with the private sector, fostering innovative financing models, leveraging sustainable supply chains, and promoting responsible business practices aligned with the SDGs.

While progress has been made, challenges persist in nurturing inclusive and effective partnerships. Ensuring equitable representation, addressing power imbalances, and bridging divides between stakeholders remain critical. Partnerships must be built on mutual trust, shared values, and a commitment to accountability and transparency, with clearly defined roles, responsibilities, and measurable goals.

As we approach the halfway mark of the 2030 Agenda, the WFP remains steadfast in its commitment to SDG 17, recognizing that collective action and collaboration are imperative for achieving Zero Hunger and the broader sustainable development objectives. By fostering innovative partnerships, mobilizing resources, and aligning efforts, we can unlock transformative synergies, accelerate progress, and build a more sustainable, equitable, and resilient world for all.
