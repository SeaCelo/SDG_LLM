Mercy Relief, a leading humanitarian aid organization, has been at the forefront of driving sustainable development efforts globally. As we approach the 2030 deadline for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it is imperative to assess the progress made and the challenges that remain, particularly concerning SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals.

SDG 17 recognizes the pivotal role of collaborative partnerships in achieving the ambitious 2030 Agenda. The scale and complexity of the global challenges we face necessitate a concerted effort from all stakeholders, including governments, civil society organizations, the private sector, and international organizations.

One of the critical aspects of SDG 17 is the mobilization of financial resources. Despite commendable efforts, the funding gap for sustainable development remains significant. According to the OECD, the annual financing gap for developing countries to achieve the SDGs is estimated to be between $1.9 trillion and $3.1 trillion. Bridging this gap requires innovative financing mechanisms, such as blended finance, impact investing, and public-private partnerships.

Mercy Relief has been at the forefront of fostering multi-stakeholder partnerships to mobilize resources and leverage collective expertise. Our collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in the aftermath of the devastating earthquakes in Nepal in 2015 is a testament to the power of such partnerships. By leveraging the respective strengths of our organizations, we were able to provide immediate relief and long-term rehabilitation support to affected communities, including the reconstruction of schools and healthcare facilities.

Another crucial aspect of SDG 17 is capacity-building and knowledge sharing. Developing countries often face challenges in accessing and utilizing cutting-edge technologies, expertise, and best practices. Mercy Relief's partnership with the Singapore International Foundation (SIF) has enabled us to transfer knowledge and skills to local communities in areas such as disaster risk reduction, water and sanitation management, and sustainable agriculture.

In the aftermath of Cyclone Idai, which devastated parts of Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Malawi in 2019, our collaboration with SIF facilitated the deployment of a team of Singapore International Volunteers (SIVs) to support our relief efforts. The SIVs, with their expertise in areas like water and sanitation, played a vital role in restoring access to clean water and promoting hygiene practices, mitigating the risk of waterborne diseases.

While progress has been made, significant challenges remain in achieving SDG 17. One of the key obstacles is the lack of policy coherence and coordination among stakeholders. Fragmented approaches and conflicting priorities can undermine the effectiveness of partnerships and hinder progress towards the SDGs.

To address this challenge, Mercy Relief has advocated for the establishment of robust governance frameworks and coordination mechanisms at national and international levels. Our engagement with the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has focused on promoting policy coherence and aligning disaster risk reduction strategies with the broader sustainable development agenda.

Furthermore, we recognize the importance of promoting inclusive and participatory partnerships that engage all segments of society, including marginalized and vulnerable groups. Our work in refugee camps and conflict-affected regions has emphasized the importance of involving local communities, particularly women and youth, in the design and implementation of humanitarian and development initiatives.

As we navigate the complexities of the global development landscape, Mercy Relief remains committed to fostering sustainable and impactful partnerships. By leveraging the collective strengths of diverse stakeholders, we can catalyze transformative change and accelerate progress towards achieving the SDGs, leaving no one behind.
