ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability presents this comprehensive analysis on the state of Sustainable Development Goal 17 (SDG 17): Partnerships for the Goals. As the international body representing over 2,500 local and regional governments committed to sustainable urban development, our assessment draws upon extensive research, case studies, and consultation with our global network of members and partners.

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development recognizes that the scale and ambition of the SDGs necessitate a revitalized global partnership that brings together all stakeholders – governments, civil society, the private sector, and others. SDG 17 serves as a critical enabler, providing the means of implementation to catalyze progress across the entire 2030 Agenda.

At the local level, multi-stakeholder partnerships have emerged as a key driver for localizing the SDGs and accelerating sustainable urban development. Cities and regions are pioneering innovative approaches to engage diverse actors, leverage complementary resources and expertise, and foster collaborative action.

One notable example is the City of Toronto's Partnership for Advancing the Sustainable Development Goals, which brings together over 40 organizations from various sectors to collectively advance the SDGs within the city. This model of shared ownership and co-creation has catalyzed numerous initiatives, including a community-based monitoring framework, capacity-building programs, and a youth engagement strategy.

Similarly, the City of Malmö, Sweden, has established the Malmö Commission on a Socially Sustainable Malmö, a unique partnership between the municipality, academia, civil society, and the private sector. This collaborative platform has facilitated evidence-based policymaking, fostered knowledge exchange, and developed long-term strategies to address systemic challenges related to social sustainability.

Effective partnerships require a conducive enabling environment, including robust governance frameworks, capacity development, and mechanisms for stakeholder engagement. In this regard, the Basque Country in Spain has implemented a comprehensive approach to SDG localization, underpinned by a multi-level governance structure that fosters vertical and horizontal coordination among various tiers of government, as well as strategic partnerships with non-state actors.

Despite these promising examples, significant challenges persist in implementing SDG 17 at the local level. Limited resources, capacity constraints, and a lack of institutional mechanisms often hinder the formation and sustainability of partnerships. Additionally, power imbalances, conflicting priorities, and divergent accountability frameworks can impede effective collaboration among diverse stakeholders.

To address these challenges, ICLEI advocates for a renewed emphasis on multi-stakeholder governance models that institutionalize partnerships and facilitate shared decision-making processes. This includes establishing clear governance structures, defining roles and responsibilities, and promoting transparency and accountability mechanisms.

Moreover, capacity development initiatives are crucial to equip local governments and stakeholders with the necessary skills and competencies to navigate the complexities of multi-stakeholder partnerships. This encompasses technical expertise in areas such as partnership brokering, conflict resolution, and stakeholder engagement, as well as soft skills like communication, facilitation, and leadership.

Innovative financing mechanisms, such as pooled funding arrangements, impact investment models, and public-private partnerships, can also play a pivotal role in mobilizing resources and leveraging the complementary strengths of diverse partners.

As we approach the midpoint of the 2030 Agenda, it is evident that achieving the SDGs will require a concerted effort and collective action from all stakeholders. SDG 17 serves as a powerful reminder that sustainable development is a shared responsibility, and that partnerships are not merely a means to an end, but a transformative pathway towards a more just, equitable, and sustainable future for all.
