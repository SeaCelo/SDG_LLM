The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have emerged as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. Among these goals, SDG 17 – "Revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development" – serves as a vital enabler and accelerator for achieving the entire 2030 Agenda.

As a leading European Sustainable Development Organisation, we recognize that the scale and complexity of the challenges we face necessitate a concerted and collaborative approach involving all stakeholders – governments, civil society, the private sector, and individuals. SDG 17 emphasizes the importance of global partnerships, finance, capacity-building, trade, policy and institutional coherence, multi-stakeholder partnerships, and data monitoring and accountability.

Financing for Sustainable Development
Achieving the SDGs requires substantial financial resources, and SDG 17 highlights the need for mobilizing both domestic and international resources. This includes mobilizing domestic resources through improved tax collection, combating illicit financial flows, and promoting sustainable lending practices. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of fulfilling official development assistance (ODA) commitments by developed countries and leveraging private sector investments.

The European Union (EU) has been a frontrunner in this regard, collectively providing €75.2 billion in ODA in 2021, representing 0.5% of its Gross National Income (GNI). However, there is still room for improvement, as only a few EU Member States have met or exceeded the United Nations' target of 0.7% of GNI for ODA. Moreover, the EU has taken steps to promote innovative financing mechanisms, such as blended finance and impact investing, to catalyze private sector investments in sustainable development projects.

Capacity-Building and Technology Transfer
Bridging the technological divide and enhancing knowledge-sharing are critical components of SDG 17. Many developing countries lack the necessary capacities and resources to effectively implement the SDGs, hindering their progress. SDG 17 emphasizes the importance of North-South, South-South, and triangular cooperation in facilitating access to science, technology, and innovation, as well as enhancing knowledge-sharing and capacity-building initiatives.

The EU has been actively involved in capacity-building efforts through various programs and initiatives. For instance, the EU's Horizon Europe program, with a budget of €95.5 billion for 2021-2027, aims to promote research and innovation, foster collaboration, and enhance the dissemination of knowledge and technology. Additionally, the EU has established partnerships with developing countries through initiatives like the Africa-EU Strategic Partnership, which focuses on promoting sustainable and inclusive development through capacity-building, knowledge-sharing, and technology transfer.

Trade and Policy Coherence
SDG 17 recognizes the importance of a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory, and equitable multilateral trading system under the World Trade Organization (WTO). It also emphasizes the need for policy coherence for sustainable development, ensuring that policies across different sectors are aligned and mutually reinforcing.

The EU has been a strong advocate for an open and fair multilateral trading system, actively participating in WTO negotiations and promoting sustainable trade practices. The EU's trade agreements increasingly incorporate provisions related to sustainable development, such as labor and environmental standards, to promote policy coherence and ensure that trade contributes to sustainable development goals.

Multi-Stakeholder Partnerships
SDG 17 underscores the importance of multi-stakeholder partnerships in mobilizing and sharing knowledge, expertise, technology, and financial resources to support the achievement of the SDGs. These partnerships bring together various actors, including governments, civil society organizations, the private sector, and academic institutions, fostering collaborative efforts and leveraging their respective strengths and resources.

The EU has actively promoted and engaged in multi-stakeholder partnerships for sustainable development. For instance, the European Commission has established partnerships with various stakeholders, including the European Development Finance Institutions (EDFI), the European Investment Bank (EIB), and the private sector, to mobilize finance and expertise for sustainable development projects. Additionally, the EU has facilitated multi-stakeholder dialogues and platforms, such as the European Sustainable Development Week, to foster collaboration and knowledge-sharing among diverse stakeholders.

Data Monitoring and Accountability
Effective monitoring and accountability mechanisms are crucial for tracking progress, identifying challenges, and ensuring transparency and accountability in the implementation of the SDGs. SDG 17 emphasizes the need for high-quality, timely, and reliable data disaggregated by income, gender, age, race, ethnicity, migratory status, disability, geographic location, and other relevant characteristics.

The EU has been a strong proponent of data monitoring and accountability frameworks for sustainable development. The Eurostat, the statistical office of the EU, has developed a comprehensive monitoring framework for the SDGs, providing regular reports and data on progress towards the goals. Additionally, the EU has supported capacity-building efforts in developing countries to strengthen their national statistical systems and enhance data collection and reporting on the SDGs.

Conclusion
SDG 17 serves as a catalyst for achieving the entire 2030 Agenda, fostering global partnerships, mobilizing resources, promoting capacity-building, facilitating trade and policy coherence, encouraging multi-stakeholder collaboration, and enhancing data monitoring and accountability. As a leading European Sustainable Development Organisation, we recognize the significance of SDG 17 and the need for concerted efforts by all stakeholders to revitalize global partnerships for sustainable development.

Through initiatives such as mobilizing finance, promoting capacity-building and technology transfer, advocating for fair trade practices, fostering multi-stakeholder partnerships, and strengthening data monitoring frameworks, the EU has demonstrated its commitment to SDG 17. However, further efforts are needed to accelerate progress and ensure that no one is left behind in the pursuit of sustainable development.
