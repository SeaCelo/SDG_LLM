The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) recognizes the pivotal role of Sustainable Development Goal 17 (SDG 17) – Partnerships for the Goals – in catalyzing the achievement of the entire 2030 Agenda. As a multilateral development bank operating across three continents, the EBRD is well-positioned to leverage its unique mandate, expertise, and resources to foster strategic partnerships that drive sustainable development at scale.

Recognizing the multidimensional nature of development challenges, the EBRD has adopted a holistic approach to SDG 17, engaging with a diverse array of stakeholders across the public and private sectors, civil society, and international organizations. This collaborative ecosystem enables the Bank to mobilize and share knowledge, expertise, technology, and financial resources, amplifying its impact and ensuring no one is left behind.

One of the EBRD's key focus areas is promoting public-private partnerships (PPPs) for sustainable infrastructure development. By leveraging its extensive experience in structuring complex transactions, the Bank facilitates the alignment of interests between governments, private sector entities, and local communities. This collaborative approach not only unlocks much-needed financing but also ensures that infrastructure projects are designed and implemented in a manner that prioritizes environmental sustainability, social inclusivity, and economic resilience.

Moreover, the EBRD recognizes the critical role of domestic resource mobilization in achieving the SDGs. Through its policy dialogue initiatives, the Bank works closely with national governments to strengthen their institutional capacities, improve regulatory frameworks, and create an enabling environment for private sector participation and investment. This comprehensive approach fosters an ecosystem conducive to sustainable economic growth, job creation, and poverty reduction.

Complementing its domestic efforts, the EBRD actively engages in international multi-stakeholder partnerships to address global challenges that transcend national boundaries. For instance, the Bank has joined forces with other multilateral development banks, United Nations agencies, and civil society organizations to tackle pressing issues such as climate change, energy security, and gender equality. These collaborative platforms facilitate knowledge sharing, align strategies, and leverage collective resources, ensuring a coordinated and impactful response to complex, interconnected challenges.

Recognizing the crucial role of technology in driving sustainable development, the EBRD has established partnerships with leading technology companies, research institutions, and innovation hubs. These collaborations not only facilitate the transfer and dissemination of cutting-edge technologies but also foster an enabling environment for innovation and entrepreneurship. By supporting the development and adoption of sustainable technologies, the Bank is accelerating the transition towards a green, circular, and digitally enabled economy across its regions of operation.

Furthermore, the EBRD acknowledges the importance of engaging with and empowering local communities as key stakeholders in the development process. Through its civil society engagement initiatives, the Bank fosters dialogues, builds capacities, and amplifies the voices of marginalized groups, ensuring that their perspectives and priorities are integrated into decision-making processes. This inclusive approach not only enhances the sustainability and ownership of development interventions but also contributes to social cohesion and resilience.

In conclusion, the EBRD's multifaceted approach to SDG 17 reflects its commitment to fostering strategic partnerships that leverage diverse expertise, resources, and perspectives to drive sustainable development at scale. By embracing a collaborative mindset, the Bank is not only maximizing its impact but also contributing to the creation of a global ecosystem that supports the achievement of the entire 2030 Agenda.
