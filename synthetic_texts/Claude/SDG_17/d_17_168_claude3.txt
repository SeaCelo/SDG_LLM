Here is a draft academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 17 (Partnerships for the Goals), written from the perspective of Michael Kinsley:

Reviving the Art of Problem-Solving Through Global Partnerships

In my decades of observing the Washington circus from the trenches of political journalism, I've developed a keen appreciation for just how knotty and intractable the great challenges facing humanity can be. From climate change and biodiversity loss to entrenched poverty and systemic inequalities, the world's most vexing problems resist easy solutions. They sprawl across borders, jurisdictions, and sectors in complex systems that defy straightforward cause-and-effect analysis. 

Conventional policymaking tools often fall short in the face of such wicked problems. Narrowly-conceived programs and siloed bureaucracies run up against the harsh realities of fragmentation, turf wars, and unintended consequences. Important stakeholders get left out of the process, while special interests wield outsized influence. We end up treating mere symptoms instead of root causes.

That's where Sustainable Development Goal 17 comes in - a powerful rallying cry to revive the fading art of collaborative problem-solving on a global scale. By promoting partnerships that bring together governments, civil society, the private sector, and other key players around shared objectives, SDG 17 offers a way to cut through the Gordian knot.

The core premise is refreshingly simple yet profound: today's hyper-connected challenges require multi-stakeholder responses that harness diversified resources, expertise, and implementation capacity. Durable solutions emerge from harnessing the comparative advantages of diverse partners aligned around common goals.

Of course, the devil is in the details of actually operationalizing such partnerships. It's no simple task to reconcile the often competing agendas, incentives, and worldviews of far-flung partners. Turf battles, power imbalances, and coordination challenges all too often scuttle promising collaborative initiatives before they can blossom.

But we've also seen shining examples of what's possible when stakeholders do manage to row in unified directions - like the vaccination campaigns that slashed childhood mortality or the ozone protection policies that prevented ecological catastrophe. At their best, global partnerships provide the integrative platform to convert lofty rhetoric into tangible, lasting impact.

Critically, SDG 17 recognizes that partnership-building is itself an ongoing process requiring investment, capacity-strengthening, and a long-term commitment to building trust and sustaining momentum. Data sharing, monitoring and accountability mechanisms, matchmaking between potential partners - all are crucial enabling factors.

From my perch as a seasoned cynic, I'll admit to instinctive skepticism about such utopian-sounding development agendas. Lofty UN declarations have a funny way of withering on the vine, smothered by realpolitik and institutional inertia. And let's face it - rhetoric about partnership and mutually-beneficial cooperation can too often mask self-interested brinksmanship between nations and factions.  

Yet we truly have no alternative but to breathe new life into innovative, inclusive, and effective models of multilateralism fit for the 21st century's biggest challenges. Imperfect as it may be, SDG 17 provides a vital rallying point for rekindling the problem-solving spirit in an era of resurgent parochialism.

Short of a cataclysmic crisis shocking us into new patterns of behavior, our best hope lies in creatively exploring every plausible avenue for catalyzing sustained, substantive cooperation. By incentivizing and equipping stakeholders to work together as genuine partners - combining fragmented knowledge, jurisdictional authority, and implementation capacity into concerted coalitions - we just might summon the collective will to move humanity's highest aspirations from rhetoric to reality.
