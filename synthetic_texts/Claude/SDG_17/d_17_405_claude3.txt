The Center for Victims of Torture (CVT) recognizes the critical role of Sustainable Development Goal 17 (SDG 17) – Partnerships for the Goals – in achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment represent a severe violation of human rights, with devastating physical and psychological consequences for victims and their communities. Addressing this global issue requires a multi-stakeholder approach, involving collaborative efforts from governments, civil society organizations, international institutions, and the private sector.

CVT's work in providing comprehensive care to torture survivors and advocating for their rights is deeply intertwined with the principles of SDG 17. Effective partnerships are crucial in ensuring access to justice, rehabilitation services, and creating an enabling environment for survivors to rebuild their lives with dignity. 

One of the key initiatives undertaken by CVT is the development of a global network of torture treatment centers and programs. This network facilitates the exchange of knowledge, best practices, and resources among partner organizations, enabling them to strengthen their capacity to provide holistic care to survivors. Through this collaborative approach, CVT leverages the expertise and resources of diverse stakeholders, amplifying the impact of their interventions.

Furthermore, CVT actively engages with governments and international bodies to advocate for the implementation of anti-torture policies and legislation. By forging strategic partnerships with influential actors, such as the United Nations, regional human rights mechanisms, and national authorities, CVT contributes to the development of comprehensive legal frameworks that prevent torture, prosecute perpetrators, and ensure access to effective remedies for survivors.

Collaboration with academic institutions and research organizations is another crucial aspect of CVT's work. By fostering research partnerships, CVT generates evidence-based insights into the long-term consequences of torture, effective treatment methods, and the systemic factors that enable or perpetuate this practice. This knowledge informs advocacy efforts, policy development, and the design of targeted interventions, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness of CVT's programs.

Additionally, CVT recognizes the importance of engaging with local communities and grassroots organizations in areas affected by conflict and violence. These local partners possess invaluable contextual understanding and established relationships with affected populations, enabling CVT to tailor its interventions to the specific needs and cultural contexts of the communities it serves. Such collaborative efforts not only enhance the relevance and sustainability of CVT's work but also contribute to building resilient and inclusive societies.

Achieving the ambitious targets set forth by SDG 17 requires mobilizing resources and fostering multi-stakeholder cooperation on an unprecedented scale. CVT actively participates in global forums and initiatives aimed at enhancing policy coherence, facilitating knowledge sharing, and mobilizing financial resources for sustainable development. By leveraging the power of partnerships, CVT amplifies its impact and contributes to the broader efforts to eradicate torture and promote human rights across the globe.

As CVT continues to navigate the complex challenges posed by torture and its far-reaching consequences, the organization remains committed to fostering innovative and inclusive partnerships that transcend boundaries and sectors. By harnessing the collective strengths and resources of diverse stakeholders, CVT strives to create a world where the dignity and rights of all individuals are upheld, and where torture is universally condemned and eradicated.
