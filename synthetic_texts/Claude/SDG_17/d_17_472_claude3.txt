Revitalizing the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development

By Fortune Editorial Board

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development represents an unprecedented commitment by all nations to tackle the world's most pressing challenges. At its core lies Sustainable Development Goal 17 (SDG 17) - a call to revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development. This bold final goal recognizes that only through collaborative multi-stakeholder partnerships, mobilizing resources and sharing expertise, can we hope to realize this transformative agenda.

The scale and ambition of the SDGs demand a new model of international cooperation that moves beyond traditional donor-recipient dynamics. SDG 17 outlines vital means of implementation - finance, technology, capacity building, trade, policy and institutional coherence, multi-stakeholder partnerships, and data monitoring and accountability. These interlinked drivers aim to catalyze progress across all 17 SDGs.

At the heart of SDG 17 lies the imperative to mobilize additional financial resources from multiple sources, crucially unlocking greater flows from the private sector. Estimates suggest the annual investment gap to achieve the SDGs in developing countries is a staggering $2.5 trillion. Crucially, innovative financing solutions like blended finance, impact investing, and sustainability-linked bonds can help direct the trillions sitting in capital markets toward sustainable development.

Moreover, SDG 17 promotes international cooperation on science, technology and innovation as a critical enabler. Access to affordable and sustainable technologies, the transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries on favorable terms, and enhancing knowledge sharing and coordination are key priorities. Collaborative research and open data sharing can accelerate advances in areas like renewable energy, sustainable agriculture and green technologies.

Capacity building represents another pillar, empowering stakeholders at all levels to plan, manage and implement the SDG agenda. This includes technical and financial assistance for developing countries to bolster institutions, build human capital through skills training, and enhance data monitoring and accountability frameworks. Organizations like the UN Technology Bank are vehicles to boost national capabilities for sustainable development.

The rules-based multilateral trading system, enshrined in the World Trade Organization, is also pivotal. SDG 17 stresses promoting a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system, alongside meaningful trade liberalization for least developed countries. Such reforms enhance access to global markets for exports from the developing world.

At its core, SDG 17 recognizes that multi-stakeholder partnerships are the key driver of the 2030 Agenda's transformative change. It calls for enhanced global partnership that mobilizes and shares knowledge, expertise, technologies and financial resources to support the SDGs in all countries. This necessarily involves coordinating policies and institutions at all levels to create an enabling environment.

Public-private partnerships, civil society engagement and city/regional networks offer innovative models to leverage the comparative advantages of diverse stakeholders. For instance, the World Economic Forum's Sustainable Development Investment Partnership operates as a fund to de-risk and catalyze investment into sustainable infrastructure in developing countries.

Finally, SDG 17's focus on data, monitoring and accountability underpins the entire 2030 Agenda. Timely, disaggregated data is crucial to track progress, hold stakeholders accountable, inform policy and ensure no one is left behind. Initiatives like the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data are bolstering national statistical capacities.

Ultimately, realizing the transformative 2030 Agenda hinges upon the degree to which the global community embraces the spirit of revitalized partnership embedded in SDG 17. Only through collaborative action, breaking down silos and catalyzing multi-stakeholder cooperation can we marshal the resources, innovation and political will to build the future we want.
