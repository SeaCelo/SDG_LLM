The Sustainable Development Goal 17, which calls for revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable development, is a pivotal enabler for the realization of the other SDGs, particularly in the realm of food security, sustainable agriculture, and natural resource management. As the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, we recognize that fostering collaborative multi-stakeholder partnerships at all levels is essential to achieving our objectives.

Over the past decade, we have witnessed a notable increase in global partnerships aimed at addressing critical challenges in food and agriculture systems. These collaborations have brought together diverse stakeholders, including governments, civil society organizations, the private sector, academia, and international organizations. Through these partnerships, we have leveraged collective expertise, resources, and innovative approaches to enhance agricultural productivity, promote sustainable practices, and improve access to markets for smallholder farmers.

One exemplary partnership is the Global Alliance for Climate-Smart Agriculture (GACSA), a multi-stakeholder platform that promotes climate-smart agriculture practices to enhance food security and resilience to climate change. Through GACSA, we have facilitated knowledge exchange, capacity building, and the development of context-specific solutions tailored to local needs. This has enabled farmers, particularly in developing countries, to adopt climate-resilient techniques, such as agroforestry, conservation agriculture, and integrated pest management, while enhancing their livelihoods and contributing to environmental sustainability.

Another significant initiative is the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) Movement, a country-led effort that brings together governments, civil society, the United Nations, donors, businesses, and researchers to tackle malnutrition in all its forms. Through this partnership, we have supported countries in developing and implementing comprehensive nutrition strategies, leveraging resources, and coordinating efforts to improve access to nutritious foods and promote healthy diets. The SUN Movement has been instrumental in raising awareness, mobilizing political commitment, and fostering multi-sectoral collaboration to address the complex challenges of malnutrition.

While these partnerships have yielded promising results, we acknowledge the ongoing challenges and the need for further collaboration and resource mobilization. Insufficient funding remains a significant barrier to achieving the SDGs, particularly in developing countries. To address this, we are actively engaging with traditional and non-traditional donors, as well as exploring innovative financing mechanisms, such as blended finance and impact investing, to catalyze private sector investment in sustainable agriculture and rural development.

Moreover, we recognize the importance of strengthening data collection, monitoring, and evaluation systems to track progress, identify gaps, and inform evidence-based decision-making. In this regard, we are collaborating with partners to develop robust indicators and data collection methodologies, leveraging new technologies like remote sensing and digital data collection tools. This will not only enhance accountability and transparency but also facilitate knowledge sharing and the replication of successful interventions across regions and contexts.

Looking ahead, we envision a future where global partnerships transcend sectoral boundaries and foster integrated approaches to addressing the interconnected challenges of food security, poverty alleviation, environmental conservation, and sustainable economic growth. By leveraging the collective strengths of diverse stakeholders, we can accelerate progress towards the SDGs and create a more sustainable, resilient, and equitable future for all.
