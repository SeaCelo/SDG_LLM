The Challenges of Forging Global Partnerships in an Age of Fragmentation and Nationalism

By Matthew Parris

As the sun sets on the tumultuous second decade of the 21st century, the noble aspirations enshrined in the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 17 – "Revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development" – appear increasingly elusive. In an era defined by resurgent nationalism, fractured geopolitics, and a erosion of multilateralism, the lofty ideal of fostering global cooperation and solidarity seems quaintly anachronistic.

Let us not mince words: the international community's collective response to the existential threats confronting humanity has been woefully inadequate. From the climate crisis to pandemics, from economic inequalities to humanitarian emergencies, our failure to forge robust, sustained global partnerships has exacerbated these challenges and imperiled the very notion of sustainable development.

The roots of this malaise can be traced, in part, to the resurgence of populist, inward-looking political movements that have spurned international cooperation in favor of narrow self-interest. Fueled by economic anxieties, cultural backlash, and a distrust of globalization, these forces have wielded the wrecking ball of isolationism against the edifice of global governance.

Consider the United States, once the standard-bearer of the liberal international order. Its retreat from global leadership roles, exemplified by the Trump administration's disdain for multilateral institutions and its withdrawal from crucial agreements like the Paris Climate Accord, sent shockwaves through the international system. While the Biden presidency has sought to reassert American engagement, the damage wrought by years of disengagement and vacillation cannot be easily undone.

Nor is this phenomenon confined to the West. Across the Global South, a new generation of leaders has embraced a muscular brand of nationalism, often couched in the language of anti-imperialism and self-determination. From Jair Bolsonaro's Brazil to Narendra Modi's India, these governments have prioritized domestic agendas over global cooperation, erecting barriers to trade, migration, and multilateral initiatives.

Even seemingly monolithic powers like China, once hailed as a champion of globalization, have retreated into a more insular, mercantilist posture. Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative, ostensibly a vehicle for global connectivity, has been criticized as a thinly veiled bid for geopolitical domination, fueling mistrust and exacerbating tensions with the West.

Amidst this fractured landscape, the call for revitalized global partnerships rings increasingly hollow. How can we forge lasting, meaningful cooperation when the very foundations of the international order are under assault from resurgent nationalisms and zero-sum geopolitics?

Yet, to abandon the quest for global solidarity would be to consign humanity to a Hobbesian future of perpetual conflict and existential peril. The challenges we face – from climate change to pandemics, from economic inequalities to mass migration – transcend borders and demand concerted, collaborative action.

Perhaps, then, the path forward lies not in resurrecting the old paradigms of globalization, but in reimagining the very nature of global partnerships. We must move beyond the traditional nation-state-centric model and embrace a more decentralized, multi-stakeholder approach that empowers cities, regions, civil society, and the private sector as agents of change.

Initiatives like the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, which unites mayors from across the globe in a shared commitment to climate action, offer a glimpse of this alternative future. By bypassing the gridlock of national politics and forging direct partnerships, local leaders have often proven more nimble and effective in tackling global challenges.

Similarly, the rise of transnational advocacy networks, enabled by digital technologies and social media, has given voice to marginalized communities and amplified the call for global solidarity. From the youth-led climate strikes to the Black Lives Matter movement, these grassroots mobilizations have transcended borders and forced global attention on issues that might otherwise have been ignored or sidelined by national governments.

Ultimately, the pursuit of revitalized global partnerships must be a multi-pronged endeavor, one that harnesses the power of technology, civil society, and decentralized networks while also seeking to revive and reform the multilateral institutions that have formed the bedrock of international cooperation.

This is no small task, to be sure. It will require a sustained commitment to dialogue, empathy, and a willingness to transcend the petty tribalism that has too often defined our age. It will demand a renewed embrace of cosmopolitan values, a recognition that our fates are inextricably intertwined, and that only through collective action can we hope to build a more just, sustainable, and prosperous world.

Yet, if history has taught us anything, it is that human civilization has repeatedly risen to confront existential challenges through the power of cooperation and solidarity. From the Enlightenment ideals that birthed the modern nation-state to the postwar architecture of global governance, our species has proven capable of transcending narrow self-interest in pursuit of a greater good.

As we grapple with the enormity of the challenges before us, let us draw inspiration from those who came before – the visionaries, the reformers, the dreamers who dared to imagine a world united in common cause. For it is only through such audacious acts of collective will that we might yet revitalize the promise of global partnership and secure a sustainable future for all.
