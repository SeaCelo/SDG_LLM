The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future. At its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are an urgent call for action by all countries – developed and developing – in a global partnership. SDG 17, "Partnership for the Goals," recognizes that the ambitious targets set forth in the 2030 Agenda can only be met through revitalized and enhanced cooperation between all stakeholders, including governments, civil society, the private sector, and international organizations.

The Asia-Pacific region, home to over 60% of the world's population and some of the most dynamic and rapidly growing economies, presents both unique challenges and opportunities for achieving the SDGs. The Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), as the regional hub promoting cooperation among its 53 Member States and 9 Associate Members, plays a pivotal role in facilitating and catalyzing multi-stakeholder partnerships to accelerate progress on the 2030 Agenda.

ESCAP's strategic approach to SDG 17 is multi-faceted, involving a range of initiatives and mechanisms designed to foster collaboration, mobilize resources, and enhance knowledge-sharing and capacity-building across the region. One key thrust is the promotion of regional economic integration and connectivity, which ESCAP views as critical enablers for sustainable development. Through initiatives such as the Regional Economic Cooperation and Integration (RECI) program, ESCAP supports member States in enhancing trade facilitation, transport connectivity, and investment promotion, thereby creating an enabling environment for regional cooperation and partnership.

Furthermore, ESCAP recognizes the importance of engaging with non-state actors, including civil society organizations, the private sector, and academia, in achieving the SDGs. The Asia-Pacific Regional CSO Engagement Mechanism (AP-RCEM) and the Asia-Pacific Regional Private Sector Partnership (AP-RPSP) serve as platforms for dialogue, knowledge-sharing, and collaborative action, ensuring that diverse voices and perspectives are incorporated into regional policymaking and implementation processes.

Financing for development is another critical area of focus for ESCAP in the context of SDG 17. The organization has been at the forefront of efforts to mobilize domestic and international resources, as well as to promote innovative financing mechanisms such as public-private partnerships and impact investing. The Asia-Pacific Sustainable Development Financing Initiative (APSDFI) is a prime example of ESCAP's commitment to leveraging partnerships to address the region's financing gaps and unlock the resources needed to achieve the SDGs.

In addition to these initiatives, ESCAP plays a pivotal role in facilitating knowledge-sharing and capacity-building among member States, ensuring that best practices, lessons learned, and innovative solutions are disseminated and adapted to local contexts. The Asia-Pacific Knowledge Platform for Sustainable Development (AP-PLAT) serves as a robust knowledge hub, providing access to high-quality data, research, and policy analysis on sustainable development issues in the region.

ESCAP's approach to SDG 17 is grounded in the recognition that no single actor can achieve the ambitious targets of the 2030 Agenda alone. By fostering multi-stakeholder partnerships, promoting regional economic integration and connectivity, mobilizing resources, and facilitating knowledge-sharing and capacity-building, ESCAP is actively working to create an enabling environment for sustainable development in the Asia-Pacific region.
