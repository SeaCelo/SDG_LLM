The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, represents a transformative blueprint for global peace and prosperity. At its core lies the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), an ambitious and interconnected framework that seeks to address the world's most pressing challenges. Among these vital objectives, SDG 17 – "Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development" – stands as a crucial enabler, catalyzing and amplifying the collective efforts towards achieving the entire 2030 Agenda.

As a nation deeply committed to international cooperation and sustainable development, Belgium recognizes the pivotal role of SDG 17 in driving systemic change and fostering genuine progress. The Belgian Policy Plan for Development Cooperation, a strategic blueprint guiding our nation's efforts in this realm, places particular emphasis on this goal, acknowledging its cross-cutting nature and its potential to unlock transformative synergies.

At the heart of SDG 17 lies the principle of global partnership, a call for concerted action and shared responsibility among nations, civil society, the private sector, and international organizations. By strengthening these collaborative frameworks, we can leverage the collective knowledge, resources, and capacities of diverse stakeholders, amplifying the impact of our interventions and accelerating progress across the entire SDG spectrum.

Central to this endeavor is the mobilization of financial resources, both domestic and international. Belgium's commitment to achieving the United Nations' target of allocating 0.7% of our Gross National Income (GNI) to Official Development Assistance (ODA) is a testament to our unwavering dedication to this cause. Furthermore, we recognize the importance of diversifying and leveraging innovative financing mechanisms, such as blended finance, to catalyze private sector investments and unlock new streams of capital for sustainable development initiatives.

Capacity building, knowledge sharing, and technology transfer are also critical components of SDG 17, enabling developing nations to strengthen their institutional frameworks, enhance human resources, and access cutting-edge technologies that can drive sustainable growth. Belgium's long-standing support for academic institutions, research centers, and technology transfer initiatives has yielded tangible results, empowering our partners to build resilient and self-sustaining systems.

Underpinning our efforts is a commitment to policy coherence for sustainable development, ensuring that our domestic and international policies align with and reinforce our shared global objectives. This holistic approach necessitates robust multi-stakeholder partnerships, effective monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, and a commitment to data-driven decision-making.

Furthermore, recognizing the imperative of inclusive and participatory processes, Belgium actively promotes the engagement of civil society organizations, indigenous communities, and marginalized groups in the formulation and implementation of sustainable development strategies. By amplifying diverse voices and empowering local actors, we can ensure that our interventions are tailored to local contexts, responsive to unique challenges, and rooted in a profound understanding of the complexities on the ground.

As we navigate the intricate landscape of global development, Belgium remains steadfast in its commitment to SDG 17 and the broader 2030 Agenda. Through strategic partnerships, innovative financing mechanisms, capacity building initiatives, and a unwavering dedication to policy coherence, we strive to catalyze transformative change and unlock the full potential of sustainable development for all.
