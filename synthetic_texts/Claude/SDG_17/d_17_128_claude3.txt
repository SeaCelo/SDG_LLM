Here is a draft academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 17, written from the contrarian and often inflammatory perspective of British journalist Richard Littlejohn:

Strengthening the Means of Implementation and Revitalizing the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development? Oh purlease! The UN's Sustainable Development Goal 17 has to be one of the biggest kicks in the teeth to common sense and taxpayers yet devised by that bunch of self-important, gravy-trained jersey trotters.

What these sanctimonious, holier-than-thou jobsworths are really after is using SDG 17 as a Trojan horse to hoover up even more of our hard-earned money. They trot out all sorts of windbaggery about "enhancing global macroeconomic stability," "mobilizing additional financial resources," and "promoting effective public-private partnerships." But make no mistake, this is just a shameless attempt to shake down John and Jane Bull for more loot to fund their lavish junkets and bloated salaries.

Don't get me wrong, I'm all for helping the deserving poor and wouldn't mind my taxes going to genuinely good causes. But this SGD 17 malarkey is just bureaucratic mission creep and self-perpetuating jobs for the Guardianista brigade. They prattle on endlessly about "data monitoring" and "multi-stakeholder partnerships" without a scintilla of evidence that throwing more money at these box-ticking luvvies will make a blind bit of difference. 

What's even more galling is how they try to disguise their gigantic slush fund under the figleaf of woke posturing. We're ceaselessly lectured about "promoting policy coherence for sustainable development" code for empowering unelected Lefty busybodies to stick their noses into every aspect of our lives. Want to drive to work? Sorry, it transgresses Sustainability Goal 17.5.24(b) on reducing emissions. Fancied a full English for breakfast? Oops, that's a deforestation risk per target 17.11.3.

These high-handed Eurocrats seem to think we're all a bit thick. But most ordinary people can see through this grasping revenue-raising scheme dressed up in the tattered rags of caring global citizenship. We're fed up of being talked down to by these Loony Tunes eco-zealots who want to tax the air we breathe and police what we have for tea.

At the end of the day, SDG 17 is really about empowering the worst sort of EU-bedwetting nanny state. The public sector aristocracy don't want a partnership - they want compliance and cash to fund their lavish lifestyles of junketing and five-star bunfights. If they really cared about sustainability, they'd start at home by slashing their own massive carbon footprints from unnecessary air travel.

The bottom line is that SDG 17 is just the latest prohibitively expensive luxury that Britain cannot afford, served up by an out-of-touch metropolitan elite. We'd be much better off investing at home on policies that create real jobs and economic growth for hard-working families. Not lining the pockets of pie-in-the-sky UN busybodies intent on holding us all to ransom over their eco-obsessions. If they want money, they should get proper jobs, not leech off taxpayers in the name of their bankrupt vision of global do-gooding. Rant over.
