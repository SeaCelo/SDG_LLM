From the perspective of the Chilean Agency for International Cooperation, achieving Sustainable Development Goal 17 (SDG 17) on the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development has become an urgent imperative on the global agenda. As the 2030 deadline approaches, it is crucial to strengthen international cooperation and multi-sectoral partnerships to mobilize the resources and knowledge needed to address the interconnected challenges of sustainable development.

In the context of Latin America and the Caribbean, the region faces unique obstacles that hinder progress toward SDG 17. Despite commendable efforts, significant gaps persist in mobilizing financial resources, accessing technology, building capacities, and ensuring policy coherence. These challenges are further compounded by structural vulnerabilities, entrenched inequalities, and the adverse effects of climate change and other external factors.

To address these complexities, a holistic and collaborative approach involving multiple stakeholders—governments, the private sector, civil society, and local communities—is imperative. Building strong partnerships and fostering inclusive dialogue are fundamental to leveraging the resources, knowledge, and diverse perspectives necessary to drive transformative change.

A key priority is mobilizing financial resources through innovative and sustainable channels. This includes exploring blended finance mechanisms that combine public and private resources, as well as implementing fiscal and regulatory incentives that encourage responsible investment in sustainable development projects. Additionally, addressing external debt and aligning financial flows with sustainable development goals are crucial.

Another priority is promoting technology transfer and knowledge sharing. This requires creating platforms and collaborative networks to facilitate access to innovative technological solutions, encourage joint research and development, and strengthen local capacities. It is also essential to address trade and intellectual property barriers that hinder the dissemination of sustainable technologies.

Strengthening institutional and human capacities at all levels—from governments to civil society organizations and local communities—is equally critical. This entails investing in training programs, skill development, and knowledge transfer, with a particular focus on empowering marginalized and vulnerable groups.

Lastly, promoting policy coherence and coordination among different stakeholders and levels of governance is essential. This involves aligning national strategies with global goals, fostering multi-stakeholder participation in policy formulation, and establishing robust monitoring and accountability mechanisms.

In summary, achieving SDG 17 requires unwavering commitment and collaborative action at the global, regional, and local levels. By building strong partnerships, mobilizing innovative resources, sharing knowledge and technologies, strengthening capacities, and ensuring policy coherence, we can overcome current challenges and build a more sustainable, inclusive, and resilient future for all nations and communities.
