Partnerships for the Goals: A Pragmatic Perspective on SDG 17
By Dani Rodrik

The 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) represent an ambitious and laudable global effort to tackle the world's most pressing challenges. However, as an economist with a penchant for pragmatism, I approach SDG 17 – "Partnerships for the Goals" – with a healthy dose of skepticism. While the intentions behind fostering global cooperation are noble, the reality of forging effective and inclusive partnerships is fraught with complexities that demand a nuanced and context-specific approach.

At the outset, we must recognize that the very notion of "partnership" is laden with implicit power dynamics and conflicting interests. The SDGs emerged from a top-down, multilateral process dominated by wealthy nations, international organizations, and a select group of stakeholders. As such, the term "partnership" often masks an underlying hierarchy, where the Global North dictates the terms of engagement, and the Global South is expected to acquiesce.

This dynamic is particularly problematic when it comes to mobilizing financial resources and promoting technology transfer, two key targets under SDG 17. Despite lofty rhetoric about "global partnership," the reality is that developing countries remain heavily dependent on aid, loans, and foreign direct investment from advanced economies and multilateral institutions. This dependence perpetuates a cycle of conditionality, where external assistance is contingent upon adopting policies and reforms that may not align with local contexts or priorities.

Moreover, the pursuit of technology transfer frequently overlooks the intricate web of tacit knowledge, institutional capabilities, and absorptive capacities required for successful adoption and adaptation. Simply providing access to technologies or intellectual property rights does little to address the deeper systemic barriers that inhibit technological diffusion and innovation in developing countries.

To truly foster effective partnerships, we must acknowledge the inherent asymmetries and power imbalances that pervade the global economic and political landscape. Instead of imposing a one-size-fits-all approach, we should embrace a pluralistic and decentralized model of development, where local communities, civil society organizations, and national governments take ownership and shape their own development trajectories.

This requires a fundamental shift in mindset, moving away from the notion of "partnerships" as a top-down imposition of global norms and instead fostering a bottom-up process of collaboration, mutual learning, and co-creation. It means empowering local stakeholders, respecting their agency, and recognizing the value of context-specific knowledge and solutions.

Rather than relying on traditional development assistance models, we should explore alternative mechanisms that promote genuine knowledge-sharing, capacity-building, and collaborative problem-solving. This could include South-South cooperation, where countries with similar socio-economic contexts exchange best practices and learn from one another's experiences. It could also involve multi-stakeholder platforms that bring together diverse perspectives, from grassroots organizations to private sector actors, to collectively identify and address development challenges.

Crucially, we must confront the systemic barriers that impede effective partnerships, such as power asymmetries, institutional weaknesses, and entrenched vested interests. This requires a concerted effort to reform global governance structures, enhance transparency and accountability mechanisms, and level the playing field for developing countries to engage as equal partners.

In essence, SDG 17 should not be viewed as a mere call for increased resource mobilization or technology transfer, but rather as a catalyst for a fundamental reconceptualization of how we approach international cooperation and development partnerships. It demands a shift towards a more inclusive, contextually grounded, and equitable model of collaboration – one that acknowledges the complexities of global interdependence while respecting the sovereignty and agency of all nations and communities.

Only by embracing this paradigm shift can we truly unlock the transformative potential of partnerships and pave the way for a more sustainable, just, and prosperous world for all.
