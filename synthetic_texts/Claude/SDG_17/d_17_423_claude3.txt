As the International Women's Development Agency, we are deeply committed to accelerating progress on Sustainable Development Goal 17: Revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development. This goal serves as a critical enabler, underpinning the successful realization of all other SDGs by fostering global cooperation and mobilizing resources from diverse stakeholders.

The global landscape remains marked by stark inequalities, with marginalized communities, particularly women and girls, disproportionately impacted by intersecting challenges such as poverty, climate change, and conflict. Addressing these multidimensional issues requires concerted efforts and a revitalized global partnership that transcends borders and brings together governments, civil society organizations, the private sector, and international institutions.

Our agency recognizes the urgent need to strengthen multi-stakeholder partnerships and enhance policy coherence for sustainable development. We must move beyond siloed approaches and embrace a holistic, integrated strategy that harnesses the collective power of diverse actors. By aligning priorities, sharing knowledge, and leveraging complementary resources, we can catalyze transformative change and accelerate progress towards gender equality and women's empowerment.

Financing for development remains a critical hurdle, hampering the implementation of ambitious sustainable development initiatives. To bridge this gap, we must explore innovative financing mechanisms and mobilize resources from both traditional and non-traditional sources. One promising initiative is the Women's Empowerment Impact Investment Fund, a collaborative effort between our agency, private investors, and multilateral organizations. This fund leverages blended finance to support women-led enterprises and initiatives that drive economic empowerment, climate resilience, and social inclusion.

Additionally, we recognize the vital role of data and monitoring in informing evidence-based policies and tracking progress towards the SDGs. Our agency is spearheading the Global Women's Data Alliance, a multi-stakeholder partnership that aims to address persistent data gaps and enhance gender-disaggregated data collection and analysis. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies, such as satellite imagery and crowdsourcing platforms, we can gain valuable insights into the lived experiences of women and girls, enabling more targeted and effective interventions.

Capacity-building and knowledge-sharing are also essential components of our approach. Our agency has established the Women's Leadership Academy, a global initiative that equips women leaders from diverse backgrounds with the skills and knowledge necessary to drive sustainable development efforts within their communities. Through this platform, we foster cross-cultural exchange, promote South-South cooperation, and amplify the voices of women changemakers, ensuring their perspectives are central to decision-making processes.

Furthermore, we recognize the inextricable link between gender equality and other critical issues such as climate action, economic growth, and peace and security. By promoting women's leadership and participation in environmental governance, we can harness their unique perspectives and traditional knowledge to develop more effective climate adaptation and mitigation strategies. Similarly, our agency advocates for women's meaningful inclusion in peace processes and conflict resolution efforts, as their engagement is vital for achieving lasting stability and sustainable development.

Looking ahead, our agency envisions a future where global partnerships are truly transformative, fostering genuine collaboration, mutual accountability, and shared responsibility. We must collectively embrace a paradigm shift, moving away from the traditional donor-recipient model towards a more equitable and inclusive approach that recognizes the valuable contributions of all stakeholders, particularly those from the Global South and marginalized communities.

In this spirit of revitalized partnership, we call upon governments, civil society, the private sector, and international organizations to join us in a united effort to accelerate progress on the Sustainable Development Goals. By leveraging our collective strengths, resources, and expertise, we can create a more just, equitable, and sustainable world for all, leaving no one behind.
