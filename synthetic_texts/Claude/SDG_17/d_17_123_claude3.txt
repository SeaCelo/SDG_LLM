Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 17, written from the perspective of the late British writer A.A. Gill:

Partnership for the Goals - SDG Shitshow 

I'll lay my cards on the table up front - I think these Sustainable Development Goals are a right bunch of old codswallop. Global wank of the highest order. A dog's dinner of good intentions and meaningless platitudes that some cabal of UN bureaucrats wanged together to give themselves something to do. That said, number 17 might just be the biggest steaming pile in the whole midden heap.

"Revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development." Good lord, who dreams up this sort of bollocks? It reads like it was written by a machine intelligence that was fed the collected works of Tony Blair and a raft of desiccated mission statements from some poxy multinational consulting firm. What fresh insanity is this? If there's one thing the world doesn't need, it's more partnerships, more globalization, more jargon-encrusted goals cooked up by navel-gazers in Geneva and New York.

Still, I'm contractually obliged to take this seriously, so here goes. The idea, from what I can maverick out, is that the only way these Dickie Dreadful development goals have a curveball's chance in the Eton tuck shop is if everyone rows in behind them. Countries, civil society, the private sector, Billy bonce's auntie - basically anyone who's still breathing. We all need to pull our fingers out and strop up to the crease.

Now there's an argument, I suppose, that some of the things nestling under this vast, all-encompassing umbrella aren't totally form. Mobilizing more financial resources for developing countries. Fair enough. Promoting equitable trade. Can't argue with that, though whether it'll ever happen is another matter. Disaggregating data to track progress for vulnerable groups. Stattos will love that one.

But christ, it's all just so high-minded and suspiciously orchidaceous, isn't it? The sort of stuff you'd expect from soiled Guardianistas who've never been punched in the throat. Take "enhancing policy coherence for sustainable development." Sounds terribly important, but I haven't got the foggiest what it means. Or "respecting national leadership to implement policies for poverty eradication." That's about as much use as a condom full of haggis.

The whole misbegotten mess reminds me of a line from that Springsteen song - "is a dream a lie if it don't come true, or is it something worse?" Maybe these SDGs started out as a noble idea, a well-intentioned quest to make the world a bit less shit. But now they've just become a bureaucratic leviathan, a virtue-signaling exercise that allows people to ponce around with a more rarefied form of whataboutery.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not against the principles behind a lot of this stuff. Poverty, hunger, conflict, climate change - they're miserable uninvited guests that need dealing with. But the solution isn't to draft more interminable targets and engage in oven-ready globaloney with every other ostrich-plucked NGO and quango that happens to wander by. It's to actually get out there and do something, rather than just attending summits and getting Pecksniffian about it all.

Perhaps I'm being too harsh though. Maybe in 50 years' time, people will look back on SDG 17 and say "ah yes, that's what finally brought the global community together to sort out our difficulties as one." More likely, it'll be gathering dust on some cyber-shelf, a relic of a more credulously messianic time. Another chapter in humanity's quixotic quest to talk itself better. But I suppose we've got to start somewhere, and revitalizing global partnerships is as good a waste of time as any.
