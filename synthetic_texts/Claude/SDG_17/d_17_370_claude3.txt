As the leading international organization championing workers' rights and promoting decent employment opportunities, the International Labour Organization has made substantial contributions toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 17 - Revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development. Our efforts have centered on fostering multistakeholder collaborations, mobilizing resources, and leveraging data to drive evidence-based policymaking and catalyze transformative change.

One of our key initiatives has been the Global Partnership for Universal Social Protection, a collaborative platform that brings together governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector. This partnership aims to extend social protection coverage to all, addressing the substantial global deficits in access to essential services such as healthcare, income security, and employment support. Through policy dialogues, knowledge-sharing, and capacity-building programs, we have facilitated the exchange of best practices and supported countries in developing robust social protection systems tailored to their unique contexts.

Recognizing the pivotal role of data in informing effective policymaking, we have invested in strengthening national statistical capacities and fostering data partnerships. The ILO's flagship program, the Better Data for Better Jobs initiative, has worked closely with national statistical offices and social partners to enhance labor market information systems, enabling countries to track progress, identify emerging trends, and make informed decisions on employment policies and programs.

Furthermore, we have actively promoted multi-stakeholder dialogues and partnerships to address complex challenges in the world of work. The ILO's Global Commission on the Future of Work, a high-level body comprising leading experts from diverse backgrounds, has facilitated discussions on issues such as technological disruption, climate change, and demographic shifts, proposing actionable recommendations for shaping a human-centered agenda for the future of work.

One noteworthy example of our collaborative efforts is the Decent Work Country Programs, which bring together governments, employers' and workers' organizations, and other stakeholders to develop contextualized strategies for advancing decent work and sustainable development. These programs have proven instrumental in aligning national priorities with the SDGs, fostering policy coherence, and mobilizing resources for targeted interventions.

Moreover, we have actively engaged in South-South and triangular cooperation, facilitating knowledge-sharing and capacity-building among developing countries. The ILO's South-South and Triangular Cooperation initiative has enabled the exchange of expertise, best practices, and innovative solutions, empowering countries to learn from one another and adapt successful models to their local contexts.

While progress has been made, significant challenges persist, including limited financial resources, capacity constraints, and fragmented efforts. To address these challenges, we have advocated for increased investments in sustainable development, emphasizing the need for diversified funding sources and innovative financing mechanisms. The ILO's Sustainable Development Goals Financing Lab has explored innovative approaches, such as impact investing, blended finance, and public-private partnerships, to mobilize resources and leverage private sector participation in achieving the SDGs.

As we look ahead, the ILO remains committed to strengthening global partnerships and fostering collaborative efforts to build a future of work that is inclusive, sustainable, and resilient. We will continue to leverage our tripartite structure, convening governments, employers, and workers to shape policies and programs that promote decent work, social protection, and sustainable development.

In conclusion, achieving the Sustainable Development Goals requires a collective and concerted effort, with partnerships playing a pivotal role in mobilizing resources, sharing knowledge, and driving coordinated action. The ILO remains steadfast in its commitment to revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable development, recognizing that only through collaboration and collective action can we create a world where economic prosperity, social justice, and environmental sustainability are realized for all.
