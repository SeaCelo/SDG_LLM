Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) as if written by Terence Blacker:

The Mirage of Global Cooperation: Deconstructing the Illusion of SDG 17

By Terence Blacker

The 17th Sustainable Development Goal, grandiosely titled "Partnerships for the Goals," is a masterpiece of obfuscation and diplomatic doublespeak. Beneath its benign veneer lies a troubling paradox that strikes at the heart of the entire UN 2030 Agenda. On one hand, this goal ostensibly calls for "revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable development." A noble aspiration, to be sure. Yet it simultaneously lays bare the stark reality that such a "global partnership" remains more fantasy than fact.

The inherent contradictions abound. We are exhorted to enhance "the global partnership for sustainable development, complemented by multi-stakeholder partnerships." But what tangible evidence exists that the fractious collective of nation-states can truly collaborate as "partners" on the sweeping, transformative agenda proposed by the SDGs? Multilateralism is a rose-tinted ideal that wilts under the slightest scrutiny.

Let us not delude ourselves. The foundations of this prospective "global partnership" are tenuous at best. Fissures emerge from the insidious fault lines of geopolitics, the yawning chasms of socioeconomic inequity, and the intractable morass of conflicting national interests. A convergence of the world's governments, private sector, and civil society on shared priorities and strategies remains an quixotic pipe dream.

One need only observe the interminable climate change negotiations to grasp the treacherous terrain of unified global action. Two decades of agonizing towards the mythical "grand bargain" have yielded a discordant cacophony of acrimonious finger-pointing, obfuscation, and delaying tactics. The watchwords are duplicity and self-interest, not partnership or sacrifice for the greater good.

The disingenuous core of SDG 17 is betrayed by its very targets and indicators. We are enjoined to "promote a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system." A noble aim, indeed. But does anyone genuinely believe the vested economic powers will jettison the instruments and mechanisms that have perpetuated their dominance? Empty rhetoric cloaks an unwavering commitment to the perpetuation of imbalanced free trade regimes.  

The goal's other targets are a hodgepodge of platitudes about "enhanced policy coherence," "multi-stakeholder partnerships," "knowledge sharing," and "data monitoring." All unobjectionable in isolation, but reflecting an almost parodic assumption that complex challenges can be dissolved through opaque bureaucratic processes. The pursuit of gauzy abstractions like "policy coherence" becomes a fragile substitute for the substantive realignment of global power dynamics and economic paradigms that sustainable development demands.

Even the goal's numeric targets reek of contrivance. The stipulation that developing countries' exports be "doubled" by 2030 is just one example of an arbitrary benchmark untethered from economic reality. The myopic focus on indicators like overseas development assistance as a percentage of donor countries' income merely reaffirms an outdated aid-centric paradigm instead of catalyzing systemic change.  

At its core, SDG 17 epitomizes the fundamental paradox paralyzing the entire 2030 Agenda. It demands revolutionary global partnership and cooperation using the ossified institutional architecture and power dynamics that arose from an era of entrenched colonial hierarchies and mercantile self-interest. The mirages of "enhanced global macroeconomic policy coordination" and "multi-stakeholder partnerships" dissipate upon the faintest contact with the immutable contours of state sovereignty and economic realpolitik.

The hubris of the entire framework is almost tragicomic. A handful of UN bureaucrats conjure forth an impossibly ambitious agenda to remake the very firmaments of human civilization. This quixotic credo is then enshrined as hallowed doctrine by largely unelected leaders and rubber-stamped through opaque processes by an alienated global populace. We are instructed to transcend our age-old inability to collaborate, shrugging off barriers of religion, culture, ideology and entrenched self-interest with a casual insouciance.

The illusory mirage of SDG 17 and its presupposition of a cohesive "global partnership" shatters against the jagged outcroppings of humanity's eternal penchant for stratification and conflict. It stands as a glaring exemplar of the entire 2030 Agenda's fatal conceit - the notion that the ingrained dysfunctions and inequities of our global order can be ameliorated through wishful rhetorical flourishes and bureaucratic diktats divorced from substantive power realignments.  

Perhaps time will prove the doubters wrong and we will all join hands, consigning our atavistic impulses to the proverbial dustbin. But for now, the soaring airs of SDG 17 evoke a darkly comic image - the naked emperor's new clothes tailored in a gossamer fabric of good intentions, woven with the threads of willful delusion. We embrace its siren song at our collective peril.
