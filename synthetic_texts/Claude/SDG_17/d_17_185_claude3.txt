Here is a draft academic article about SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) from the perspective of political cartoonist and polemicist Ted Rall:

The Golden Calf of Globalism: SDG 17 and the Failed Utopian Vision

The grand peddlers of globalization have done it again. With Sustainable Development Goal 17 - the unholy union of government, big business and NGOs - the UN has rolled out its latest utopian pipe dream wrapped in humanitarian packaging. But behind the lofty rhetoric about "revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable development" lies the same rotten core: corporate appeasement and capitulation to the neo-liberal hegemony.

Let's start with those saccharine "partnerships" between the public and private sectors. We've seen how this cozy arrangement plays out, with governments cheerfully auctioning off public assets and services to the highest corporate bidder. From water privatization fiascos to homeless shelters traded as speculative derivatives, human rights and the public good are gleefully traded away in the pursuit of profit. Is anyone surprised when rapacious multinationals call the shots, hollowing out the machinery of state into a vehicle for corporate welfare?

And the NGOs welcomed into this malignant tango? Largely subservient corporate apologists, Trojan horses coopted by their big money benefactors. Take a close look at many of the major international NGOs and you'll find a parade of former corporate operatives and Wall Street hatchet men populating their ranks in revolving-door exchanges of favors and future job opportunities. With stakes this high and money this green, you can be assured the NGOs will peddle any position that keeps them at the trough. 

This entire framework is merely a flimsy veil draped over the molten core of global capitalism, a branding exercise intended to swaddle its privations and exploitation under a humanitarian veneer. At best it's a top-down model built around coercion, unfair trade policies imposed by wealthy countries to pry open markets for multinational plunder. At worst, nothing more than a Trojan horse to extend empire through regime change and debt bondage.

The real goal? Transformative global partnerships to dismantle corporate hegemony and disrupt the neo-colonial dynamics that immiserate the global south. Until we reject this counterfeit model of development dictated by plutocrats and monopolists, the Sustainable Development Goals will remain a parade of hollow slogans that reinforce the very injustices they pretend to rectify.
