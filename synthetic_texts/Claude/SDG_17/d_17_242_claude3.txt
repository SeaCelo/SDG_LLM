Strengthening the Means of Implementation and Revitalizing the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development: An Econometric Inquiry into SDG 17

By Joshua D. Angrist

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development represents a global commitment to address the world's most pressing challenges, from poverty and inequality to climate change and environmental degradation. At the heart of this ambitious endeavor lies the Sustainable Development Goal 17 (SDG 17), which seeks to "strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development." This goal recognizes that achieving the other 16 SDGs hinges upon the collective efforts of governments, civil society, the private sector, and international organizations, underpinned by a robust framework of finance, technology, capacity-building, and trade.

As an empirical economist, I approach SDG 17 through the lens of causal inference, seeking to understand the causal mechanisms that drive progress towards this goal and the potential impacts of interventions designed to accelerate its achievement. To this end, I propose a series of quasi-experimental research designs that leverage natural experiments, instrumental variables, and regression discontinuity approaches to shed light on the complex interplay of factors that shape global partnerships and resource mobilization.

One area ripe for investigation is the role of foreign aid in promoting sustainable development. While aid flows have long been a subject of contention, with debates surrounding their effectiveness and potential for distorting incentives, a growing body of evidence suggests that aid can have significant positive impacts when properly targeted and implemented. By exploiting exogenous variation in aid flows due to factors such as geopolitical shifts or natural disasters, we can employ instrumental variables strategies to estimate the causal effect of aid on various indicators of sustainable development, including economic growth, poverty reduction, and access to essential services.

Another critical aspect of SDG 17 is the transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries. Here, we might leverage regression discontinuity designs that exploit the eligibility criteria for technology transfer programs or the thresholds used to determine access to concessional financing for green technology adoption. By comparing outcomes for countries or firms just above and below these cutoffs, we can estimate the causal impact of technology transfer and identify the factors that facilitate or hinder its diffusion.

Moreover, the role of trade in promoting sustainable development warrants careful examination. While trade liberalization has been touted as a driver of economic growth and poverty reduction, its environmental and social impacts are often contested. By exploiting natural experiments, such as the accession of countries to regional trade agreements or the imposition of trade barriers due to political events, we can employ difference-in-differences and synthetic control methods to assess the causal effects of trade policies on various dimensions of sustainable development.

Underpinning these empirical inquiries is a recognition of the heterogeneity in the experiences of different countries and the need for contextualized policy interventions. As such, we must be attentive to the potential for treatment effect heterogeneity and explore the mechanisms through which interventions may differentially affect outcomes across different contexts. This may involve the use of moderation analysis, causal mediation analysis, or the integration of qualitative methods to unpack the nuanced pathways through which global partnerships and resource mobilization influence sustainable development outcomes.

Ultimately, the pursuit of SDG 17 requires a multidisciplinary approach that combines rigorous econometric analysis with insights from other fields, such as political science, sociology, and environmental studies. By embracing this interdisciplinary perspective and leveraging the power of causal inference, we can better understand the complex dynamics that shape global partnerships and resource mobilization, and inform evidence-based policymaking to accelerate progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.
