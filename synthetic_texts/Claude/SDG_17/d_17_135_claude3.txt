Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 17 - Partnerships for the Goals, as if written by satirist Mark Steel:

We're always being told by pundits and bores that the world's problems are just too complex and interlinked for any single government or organization to solve on their own. As if we didn't already know that. I could have told them that years ago just from trying to put together a bedside cabinet from Ikea. You need partnerships for absolutely everything these days, which is presumably why they made SDG 17 about revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable development. 

I'm hugely in favor of sustainable development by the way, it's a great idea. Though I'm not totally convinced we've got the implementation right so far given the existential threat of climate change, the 6th mass extinction event currently underway, plastic polluting every corner of the earth, and habitat destruction that's making a A raccoon feel like dropping in uninvited any night now. But I'm sure our partnerships will sort that out.

The targets for SDG 17 include increasing international cooperation and "multi-stakeholder partnerships." That's civil society getting involved as well by the way, not just governments and corporations. So that's probably why I keep getting texts from Greenpeace asking if I can pop down to the Phillip Green's superyacht rental office on Tuesday to engage in some "multi-stakeholder action." I've had to politely decline as I'm an extremely reluctant multi-stakeholder.

Mobilizing additional financial resources is also key for SDG 17. Well yes, obviously. You can't get the global community working seamlessly together without pumping absolutely epic amounts of cash into it. I know from experience how expensive all those partnership awayday sessions are, with the motivational gurus, team building exercises, and facilitators making you slam your hand on the table every few minutes shouting "Yes! We can achieve literally anything!" I assume for the SDGs we're talking billions spent on awaydays alone.

Then there's the technology transfer target, because sustainable development obviously requires spreading technologies like solar and wind power to developing countries. Though I've got to say, some of those technologies like lithium battery production do seem to have some fairly major environmental impacts which we might need to look at. Unless the plan is to swap one set of environmental catastrophes for another? Genius!

Speaking of looking at things, there's also a data monitoring target for the SDGs. Monitoring and accountability are critical after all. Though I'm not sure how they're going to implement review mechanisms that are "transparent and participative" while also respecting each nation's "policy space." It rather sounds like an aimless drive around the industrial estates on a Sunday in the sincere hope of possibly finding a monitor selling knock-off participative mechanisms from the back of his van.

Anyway, those are just my thoughts as a dispassionate, totally objective observer of the SDG process. I'm sure with a spirit of revitalized global cooperation, utilizing voluntary partnerships and all available resources, the world can be put absolutely squarely on a path toward sustainable development by 2030. And if that doesn't work, we can move on to aimlessly wandering the industrial estates looking for a cheeky solutionist.
