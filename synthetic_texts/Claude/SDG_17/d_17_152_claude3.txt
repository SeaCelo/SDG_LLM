Here is a long academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 17 (Partnerships for the Goals), written from the perspective of Gail Collins:

The Cheerful Game of Global Legislative Whac-a-Mole

If you ever get the chance to read the transcripts from U.N. meetings on sustainable development, grab it. It's comedy gold. Diplomats and bureaucrats from countries that can't even manage to have fair elections or collect the garbage on time endlessly patting each other on the back about their tireless efforts to transform the world. 

Take SDG 17 — the one about "revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable development." It's like the mom in those old TV Christmas specials, urging all the squabbling kids to bond while hanging tinsel on the tree. Get with the program, people! We're all in this together!

Where exactly does one locate this blissful global community? Hard to say. Afghanistan and its new friends, the Taliban government, don't seem very keen on partnerships at the moment. Vladimir Putin has terminated Russia's relationship with the entire democratic world. Kim Jong Un has nukes and munchies but no trusted allies. That's roughly a third of the world's population locked out of the circle of love.

Then there are the dozens of fragile states and failed states that have lost their grips on internal peace — South Sudan being an unusually tragic example this year. You really expect people worrying about getting blown up or dying of starvation and cholera to spend a lot of energy on integrated policy frameworks?

The United Nations says we're all supposed to be working together to "mobilize additional financial resources for developing countries from multiple sources." Let me ask — how's that going so far? Developing nations were supposed to get $100 billion a year in climate finance alone, but missed that target. Again.

It's like every year the U.N. sits around hoping Mom and Dad will win the lottery so they can finally buy that pony they were promised back in 2015 when the SDGs were first unveiled. Instead, global development assistance flows are basically flat, pandemics keep sucking away resources, and authoritarian regimes are squeezing philanthropy.

Now, I'm not saying all international cooperation and public-private partnerships have gone to hell. On the contrary, we've seen some great examples recently of countries working together to create global goods. Just look at the scientific Avengers team that developed the mRNA COVID vaccines in record time. Or the ones helping put those crucial satellite eyes over Ukraine to document Russian war crimes.

But let's be real—those herculean cooperative efforts came together around a few very specific challenges that motivated all the key players to pool their resources toward an urgent common goal. The rest of the time it's like a zillion different nations, NGOs, companies, and activist groups are playing a manic round of legislative Whac-a-Mole, with new issues constantly popping up in random places and everyone frantically batting at whatever crisis happens to loom largest from moment to moment.

One day it's Ukraine dominating the agenda, the next it's baby formula shortages. Monkeypox steals the spotlight for a while, promptly getting shoved aside by Dobbs and the abortion wars. Then it's climate change, extreme weather, melting glaciers. But wait — look over there! China's rattling its sabers toward Taiwan. And back home, gun violence, voting rights, the nightmare economy, and the zombie remains of Trumpism are sucking away all the oxygen.

Meanwhile, our ability to deal with complex, interlocking, long-term challenges seems to get more scattershot and feeble with each passing year. Heaven help us if we ever actually faced a decades-spanning grind like transforming global agriculture and energy systems to sustainable models, or getting serious about curbing population growth in a just and ethical way.

So yeah, SDG 17 and its calls for a "universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system" aren't exactly setting the world on fire at the moment. More like flickering and straining to stay lit amongst the relentless windstorms and rainstorms pummeling us from every direction.

So for all you young bright-eyed wonks out there dreaming of globally harmonized policies and seamless international programs—come on in, the water's lovely. We've got miles to go before we sleep, but at least the metaphorical sea is solidly boiling by now. Progress!
