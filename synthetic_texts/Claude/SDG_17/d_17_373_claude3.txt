The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) recognizes the pivotal role of SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) in achieving the ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. As a leading humanitarian organization with a global presence, the IFRC is uniquely positioned to leverage its vast network of National Societies, partners, and stakeholders to catalyze collective action towards this transformative goal.

Forging robust and inclusive partnerships is imperative to mobilize resources, share knowledge, and foster synergies that can drive progress across the entirety of the 2030 Agenda. The IFRC's principled approach to partnership-building, grounded in neutrality, impartiality, and independence, enables it to engage with a diverse array of actors, from governments and international organizations to civil society, the private sector, and local communities.

Central to our efforts is the localization of the SDGs, recognizing that sustainable development must be driven by the unique contexts, needs, and capacities of communities on the ground. Through our extensive network of National Societies and community-based volunteers, we facilitate the co-creation of locally-tailored solutions that resonate with the lived experiences of those most affected by humanitarian crises and development challenges.

Furthermore, the IFRC has been actively cultivating innovative multi-stakeholder partnerships that harness the collective expertise, resources, and reach of diverse actors. One such initiative is the Triple Billion Climate Risk Integrator, a pioneering collaboration with the World Bank, the World Health Organization, and the Met Office, among others. This groundbreaking partnership aims to integrate climate risk management into development planning, leveraging cutting-edge data and analytics to inform decision-making and enhance resilience for vulnerable communities.

Recognizing the critical role of financial resources in achieving the SDGs, the IFRC has been at the forefront of exploring innovative financing mechanisms. The Forecast-based Financing (FbF) initiative, for instance, utilizes advanced weather forecasting and risk analysis to trigger anticipatory humanitarian action, enabling early response and mitigating the impacts of natural disasters. This innovative approach has been made possible through strategic partnerships with organizations like the German Red Cross, the World Food Programme, and the Climate Centre.

Moreover, the IFRC is actively engaged in promoting South-South and triangular cooperation, facilitating the exchange of knowledge, expertise, and resources among developing countries. Our regional and sub-regional networks serve as platforms for peer-to-peer learning, capacity-building, and the dissemination of best practices, fostering a spirit of solidarity and mutual support.

Recognizing the multidimensional nature of sustainable development, the IFRC is committed to fostering cross-sectoral partnerships that bridge humanitarian, development, and peacebuilding efforts. Through initiatives such as the Humanitarian-Development-Peace Nexus, we collaborate with diverse partners to address the root causes of vulnerability, enhance resilience, and promote sustainable peace and development.

Underpinning our partnership efforts is a strong emphasis on data and evidence-based decision-making. The IFRC's pioneering work in developing the 510 Data Responsibility Policy and the Humanitarian Data Portal exemplifies our commitment to responsible data management and sharing, ensuring that data is accessible, interoperable, and leveraged to inform evidence-based policymaking and programming.

As we navigate the complex and interconnected challenges of the 21st century, the IFRC remains steadfast in its commitment to fostering inclusive, impactful, and transformative partnerships that can catalyze collective action towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. By harnessing the power of collaboration, innovation, and localized solutions, we strive to create a more resilient, equitable, and sustainable world for all.
