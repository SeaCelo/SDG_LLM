Here is a draft academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 17 (Partnerships for the Goals), written from the perspective of Richard Cohen: 

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development represents an unprecedented blueprint for addressing the world's most pressing challenges through a holistic and interconnected set of goals and targets. At its core lies SDG 17 - Partnerships for the Goals - which embodies the fundamental recognition that achieving this ambitious agenda requires revitalized and enhanced cooperation at all levels.  

The complexity and cross-cutting nature of the SDGs necessitates collaboration that transcends traditional silos and fosters innovative alliances spanning governments, civil society, the private sector, academia, and others. Only through harnessing the collective resources, knowledge and complementary strengths of diverse stakeholders can we overcome systemic barriers and catalyze the transformative change needed.

Multilateral partnerships have long been heralded as pivotal for driving progress on global issues. However, the paradigm shift ushered in by the SDGs demands a more comprehensive and substantive approach that moves beyond simplistic frameworks. We must disrupt entrenched power dynamics, address asymmetries, and dismantle inequities that have historically undermined well-intentioned collaboration.

SDG 17 calls for the mobilization and effective utilization of financial resources from domestic and international sources, public and private alike. Yet financing remains one of the most formidable bottlenecks. Enhancing support to developing countries through aid, foreign direct investment, debt relief measures and fair trade policies is imperative. But averting a global shortfall also hinges on leveraging innovative modalities like blended finance, impact investing and public-private partnerships tailored to national realities. 

Capacity building represents another core tenet, empowering all countries to systematically track progress, enhance data collection mechanisms, and utilize quality, timely and disaggregated data to inform evidence-based policymaking. Building institutional and human capital through technology transfer, knowledge sharing and multi-stakeholder platforms is vital for translating ambition into implementation, particularly in least developed countries.

However, one of the most profound challenges is establishing an enabling policy environment that incentivizes collaboration. Enhancing policy coherence by aligning national frameworks, sectoral priorities and governance structures with the SDGs is crucial. So too is regulatory reform that stimulates private sector engagement beyond corporate social responsibility toward re-orienting core business practices around sustainability principles.

Ultimately, unleashing the full potential of SDG 17 requires a seismic cultural and ideological shift. We must move beyond surface-level alliances by embracing mutual accountability, shared responsibility and the collective ownership of results. A renewed global partnership catalyzed through genuine political will, transformative leadership and sustained commitment represents the linchpin for securing the future we want.

Only by transcending deeply-rooted patterns, reconciling tensions between competing interests, and institutionalizing cooperation as the overarching norm can we harness the catalytic power of partnerships. The audacity of the 2030 Agenda demands nothing less than a radical reimagining of how we work together to achieve our common goals.
