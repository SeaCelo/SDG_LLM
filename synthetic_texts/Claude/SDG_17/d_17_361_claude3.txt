The Development Bank of Latin America and the Caribbean (CAF) presents this analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 17 (SDG 17) â€“ "Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development." As the regional development bank, CAF is committed to fostering strategic alliances, mobilizing resources, and promoting innovative partnerships to accelerate sustainable development across Latin America and the Caribbean.

In an increasingly interconnected world, the success of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development hinges on the collective efforts of governments, multilateral organizations, the private sector, civil society, and academia. SDG 17 underscores the importance of global cooperation, resource mobilization, capacity building, and multi-stakeholder partnerships to achieve the ambitious goals set forth by the United Nations.

One of the primary challenges in our region is the persistent financing gap for sustainable development initiatives. Despite economic growth in recent decades, Latin American and Caribbean countries still face significant infrastructure deficits, limited access to technology, and capacity constraints. Addressing these issues requires a concerted effort to mobilize domestic and international resources, both public and private.

CAF recognizes the pivotal role of domestic resource mobilization in financing sustainable development. We have worked closely with member countries to strengthen tax administration systems, combat illicit financial flows, and promote responsible borrowing practices. However, domestic resources alone are insufficient, necessitating the exploration of innovative financing mechanisms.

Blended finance, which combines public and private capital, has emerged as a promising approach to catalyze investments in sustainable development projects. CAF has actively supported the development of blended finance instruments, such as green bonds and impact investments, to attract private capital towards projects with positive environmental and social impacts.

Furthermore, we acknowledge the importance of Official Development Assistance (ODA) in supporting the least developed and most vulnerable countries in the region. While ODA flows to Latin America and the Caribbean have been historically low, CAF advocates for increased and more effective utilization of these resources, particularly in areas such as climate adaptation, disaster risk reduction, and sustainable infrastructure.

Capacity building is another critical component of SDG 17, as it empowers countries and institutions to effectively implement sustainable development initiatives. CAF has prioritized capacity building programs for public officials, private sector actors, and civil society organizations, focusing on areas like project management, environmental and social risk assessment, and monitoring and evaluation.

Moreover, we recognize the transformative potential of multi-stakeholder partnerships in addressing complex development challenges. CAF has facilitated numerous public-private partnerships (PPPs) in sectors like renewable energy, transportation, and water and sanitation. These partnerships leverage the expertise and resources of diverse actors, fostering innovation, risk-sharing, and long-term sustainability.

Furthermore, CAF has actively engaged with regional and global platforms to promote knowledge sharing, policy coherence, and collective action towards sustainable development. Our participation in initiatives like the Inter-American Development Bank's NDC Invest platform and the United Nations' Sustainable Development Solutions Network has enabled us to collaborate with a diverse range of stakeholders and contribute to the global discourse on sustainable development.

Looking ahead, CAF envisions a future where Latin America and the Caribbean are at the forefront of sustainable development, driven by strong partnerships, innovative financing mechanisms, and a shared commitment to leaving no one behind. We remain steadfast in our role as a catalyst for sustainable development, fostering collaboration, mobilizing resources, and empowering our member countries to achieve the ambitious goals set forth in the 2030 Agenda.
