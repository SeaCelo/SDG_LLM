Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) written from the perspective of Maureen Dowd, the renowned op-ed columnist:

A Global Tug-of-War on Sustainable Progress

By Maureen Dowd

At first blush, the 17th Sustainable Development Goal seems like a no-brainer, am I right? Just foster some global partnerships and we can achieve all those lofty moon shots about ending poverty, protecting the planet, and ensuring peace and prosperity.  

But when you wade into the geopolitical swampland and behold the current state of international relations, SDG 17 looks more like a mirage.  Let's be honest, the world is devolving into a dog-eat-dog arena where nations are turning inward, trade wars are raging, and the idea of countries holding hands and working lockstep on common threats feels utterly quixotic.

Take the fractured response to the pandemic as Exhibit A. Instead of a unified global front, it was a pathetic scene of nations scrambling for PPE and vaccines, borders slamming shut, and xenophobia flaring as the crisis starkly highlighted what the Harvard philosopher Michael Sandel calls "the moral limits of markets."

Or look at climate change, the existential crisis of our time that demands unprecedented cooperation across borders. As other countries take bold steps, America has slunk back into a reckless era of fossil fuel fetishism under cynical Republican leaders appeasing their coal and big oil paymasters.  

SDG 17 calls for "revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable development." But that partnership is seriously ailing, disrupted by tectonic forces turning our world into a zero-sum gladiator pit guided by the law of the jungle.

On one side, we have Western powers desperately clinging to an archaic Pax Americana and rules-based international order. This old guard is being relentlessly challenged by revisionist powers like China, Russia, and rogue regimes who are rigging the system, leveraging their sovereign wealth funds, hijacking technologies, and rewriting the rules to serve their own rapacious interests and authoritarian agendas.  

This clash is made more ominous by the devolution of America from a beacon of progress to a laughingstock of know-nothing populism and chronic political constipation. You can't lead the free world when you can't even keep your own tribal house in order or agree on basic facts and democratic norms.

We are trapped in a dangerous vacuum of global leadership, and the void is being exploited by bad actors chipping away at human rights, squelching dissent, spreading disinformation, and cementing ruthless autocratic capitalist models that care more about economic dominance than saving the planet or uplifting the world's poorest.

The SDGs champion "policy and institutional coherence." But that rhetoric is jarring when you consider how global institutions like the UN, WTO and WHO have been enfeebled by neglect and nationalist forces seeking to dismantle any constraints on their ambitions.

Without courageous ambassadors to mobilize transnational campaigns, without consistent funding and enforcement mechanisms, without cooperation across governments, NGOs, businesses and civil societies - all pillars stressed in SDG 17 - these global goals will remain noble aspirations gathering dust on a shelf.

Cynics may lampoon the SDGs as a utopian wish list. But in an age of tribalism, intolerance and us vs. them mentalities, it's more vital than ever to rally around shared ethical responsibilities and principles beyond narrow self-interests.

Critics are right that SDG 17 has no teeth, and the naïveté of "getting everyone on the same page" feels almost quaint when nations are openly warring, democracy is backsliding, and the COVID-19 case study exposed how quickly enlightened self-interest devolves into selfish unilateralism. 

But that makes the underlying message of SDG 17 - that we inhabit
