Here is a long academic article about SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals), written from the perspective of satirical novelist Carl Hiaasen:

Well folks, the gang of do-gooders at the United Nations have cooked up another well-intentioned but hopelessly naive plan to save the world. This time it's the Sustainable Development Goal #17 - the one about "revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable development." Give me a break. 

These diplomats keep churning out these lofty, buzzword-laden goals with all the self-importance of drunken frat boys planning their spring break road trip. Somebody obviously got ahold of a thesaurus and just went hog-wild. "Revitalize"? What exactly are they revitalizing? Their Rotary Club wine and cheese budget?

Let's take a look at what this particular plate of word salad is supposed to accomplish: "Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development." Sure, why not? We'll get right on strengthening those "means of implementation," whatever the hell that means.

The first sub-goal talks about "enhancing the global partnership for sustainable development." Because if there's one thing this messy world needs, it's more unclear and unmeasurable partnerships! I'm sure more Memorandums of Understanding and collaborative frameworks will have the planet's existential crises whipped into shape in no time.

Then we get into "mobilizing additional financial resources" - because obviously the problem so far has been a lack of money thrown at environmental and social issues, not the reality that much of it gets siphoned off by grifters or squandered on bloated bureaucracies. But don't worry, these green-tinted utopians have it all figured out now.

My personal favorite has to be sub-goal 17.6: "Enhance North-South, South-South and triangular regional and international cooperation on and access to science, technology and innovation." I don't know what beverage was lacing the punch bowl when they dreamed up that tangled word-garble, but I'll take a case. Just try to diagram that grammatically hazardous hunk of jargon - you'll need a drool cup.

Of course, no UN decree would be complete without some mind-numbing droning about "capacity-building" and "multi-stakeholder partnerships." Because obviously the solutions have eluded us simpletons for lack of a decent catchphrase and some mid-level supervisor synergy sessions.

Look, I'm all for soaking the rich, conserving nature, and slapping the cuffs on any corporate sultans who treat the planet like a rented rug. But forgive me for being skeptical of any planet-rescuing panacea that gets hashed out in the diplomatic equivalent of a Model UN meeting. 

Maybe I'm just a curmudgeon getting too old and jaded. Or maybe I've seen one too many of these achingly sincere "global partnership" gestures crumble like  a stale Entenmann's coffee cake amid the realities of nation-state politics and institutional inertia. Fool me once, as they say.

The developing world gets hosed again and again thanks to cronyism, exploitation, and corruption - a malignant trifecta these sanitized UN utopians couldn't conceive of even after too many warm Zimas. But hey, at least they've got a shiny new set of sustainability goal posts to vigorously rearrange.  

Meanwhile, I'll be over here holding my breath for that "global partnership for sustainable development" to magically materialize. Maybe it'll happen right after I get a coherent answer on whatever the hell "triangular cooperation" is supposed to mean. Don't quit your day jobs, UN wordsmiths.
