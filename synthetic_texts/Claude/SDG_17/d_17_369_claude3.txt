As the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), an agency dedicated to eradicating poverty and hunger in rural areas through sustainable agricultural development, we recognize the crucial role of Sustainable Development Goal 17 (SDG 17) in achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

SDG 17, which aims to "Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development," is a catalyst for accelerating progress across all other SDGs. Without robust partnerships, adequate financing, and effective policy coherence, our efforts to combat poverty, food insecurity, and environmental degradation would be significantly hampered.

One of the key challenges we face is the persistent funding gap for sustainable development, particularly in the least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing states (SIDS). While official development assistance (ODA) from traditional donors remains crucial, we must explore innovative financing mechanisms to mobilize additional resources. This includes leveraging public-private partnerships, blended finance, and impact investing to unlock private capital for sustainable agricultural projects.

IFAD has been at the forefront of promoting innovative financing solutions. Our Adaptation for Smallholder Agriculture Programme (ASAP), for instance, blends donor contributions with IFAD's own resources to channel climate finance to smallholder farmers, enhancing their resilience to climate change. Additionally, our Facility for Refugees, Migrants, Forced Displacement and Rural Stability (FARMS) initiative aims to attract private sector investment to create economic opportunities and promote stability in crisis-affected rural areas.

Effective partnerships are also essential for knowledge-sharing, capacity-building, and technology transfer. IFAD collaborates with a wide range of stakeholders, including governments, civil society organizations, research institutions, and the private sector, to facilitate the exchange of best practices, technical expertise, and innovative solutions for sustainable agriculture.

For example, our collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP) through the Rural Poor Stimulus Facility (RPSF) aims to enhance the productive capacities of rural communities affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. By leveraging our collective strengths and resources, we can provide a comprehensive package of support, including inputs, training, and market access, to help these communities recover and build resilience.

Furthermore, we recognize the need for policy coherence and an enabling environment for sustainable development. IFAD actively engages with national governments and regional bodies to promote policies that support smallholder agriculture, such as secure land tenure, access to markets, and inclusive rural financial services. Our Country Strategic Opportunities Programmes (COSOPs) ensure alignment with national development priorities and facilitate policy dialogue for creating an enabling environment for rural transformation.

As we look to the future, IFAD remains committed to strengthening global partnerships and means of implementation to achieve the SDGs. We will continue to foster multi-stakeholder collaborations, explore innovative financing mechanisms, and advocate for policy coherence to support sustainable agricultural development and rural transformation.

Ultimately, SDG 17 is a powerful catalyst for achieving the 2030 Agenda, and IFAD recognizes its critical importance in our efforts to eradicate poverty, enhance food security, and promote sustainable agriculture. By leveraging partnerships, mobilizing resources, and promoting an enabling policy environment, we can accelerate progress towards a more prosperous, equitable, and sustainable future for rural communities worldwide.
