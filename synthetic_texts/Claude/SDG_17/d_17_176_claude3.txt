Here is a draft academic article on SDG 17 written from the perspective of Harold Meyerson:

Revitalizing the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development

In a world riven by inequality, conflict, and environmental calamity, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development stands as a beacon of hope - an ambitious, comprehensive blueprint for addressing the greatest challenges of our time. At its core lies SDG 17, which calls for a revitalized global partnership to support and achieve the ambitious goals. However, as we approach the halfway mark, it is clear that progress has been alarmingly slow and uneven. The forces of isolationism, nationalism, and corporate greed have eroded international cooperation and derailed efforts to mobilize the resources and reforms needed. If we are to realize the transformative potential of the 2030 Agenda, a radical course correction is urgently needed.

The initial folly was the flawed assumption that the existing international architecture - shaped by neoliberal fundamentalism and corporate capture - could somehow be repurposed to advance a truly progressive agenda. The Bretton Woods institutions and entities like the WTO have long served as agents of economic colonialism, prying open markets in the Global South for Western exploitation while imposing draconian austerity and privatization. Corporations have ruthlessly pursued profit at the expense of human rights, labor standards, and ecological sustainability. The UN itself remains paralyzed by the veto power of the permanent Security Council members who jealously guard their prerogatives.

To revive the spirit of global cooperation and garner the resources needed, we must first reject the market funcdamentalism that has enriched the few while immiserating the many. A financial transactions tax, combined with a crackdown on tax havens and transfer mispricing by multinational corporations, could generate trillions to fund the SDGs. However, such measures will meet fierce resistance from the reactionary forces seeking to maintain their plutocratic dominance.  

But finance is just one part of the equation. We must overhaul the rules and structures governing trade, investment, intellectual property, and technology transfers to align with Sustainable Development principles. This means upending the current corporate-driven regime which allows companies to trample labor rights, plunder natural resources, and circumvent environmental regulations through a tangled web of trade and investment treaties. A new multilateral framework is needed to subordinate corporate interests to the higher imperatives of human development, ecological preservation and equitable prosperity.    

Technology and knowlege-sharing lie at the heart of SDG 17's vision for an invigorated global compact. However, the prevailing intellectual property regime has enabled a handful of Western nations and multinational corporations to jealously hoard technological innovations behind a thicket of patents and licensing fees. This stifles diffusion to developing nations, perpetuating technological apartheid. To democratize access and accelerate sustainability transitions, we must radically expand innovation commons, open source platforms, technology transfers, and exemptions for developing countries.                  

Fundamentally, revitalizing global partnerships means redressing the entrenched power imbalances, exploitation, and skewed resource flows plaguing the global economic architecture. The SDGs can only be realized through a new internationalism that rejects the paradigm of corporate plunder and centers the priorities of the world's marginalized majorities. A lofty ambition to be sure, but one to which the 2030 Agenda beckons us.
