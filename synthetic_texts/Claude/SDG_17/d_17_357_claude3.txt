As the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), a multilateral development bank dedicated to financing infrastructure projects in Asia, we recognize the pivotal role of Sustainable Development Goal 17 (SDG 17) in catalyzing global partnerships and mobilizing resources to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

SDG 17 serves as the linchpin for the successful implementation of all other SDGs, underscoring the importance of fostering collaborative efforts, leveraging innovative financing mechanisms, and enhancing policy coherence at all levels. By promoting global partnerships and strengthening the means of implementation, this goal has the potential to unlock transformative change and accelerate progress across the entire sustainable development landscape.

At AIIB, we are acutely aware of the multifaceted challenges faced by developing countries in Asia, particularly in bridging the infrastructure investment gap. Estimates suggest that Asia alone requires an annual investment of $1.7 trillion in infrastructure to sustain its growth momentum and address pressing developmental needs. Recognizing this imperative, AIIB has strategically aligned its operations with SDG 17, forging partnerships that transcend borders and sectors.

One of our core priorities is to mobilize financial resources from diverse sources, including public and private sectors, multilateral institutions, and non-traditional financing avenues. By leveraging our unique position as a multilateral development bank, we facilitate the convergence of capital flows, catalyzing co-financing arrangements and blended finance models. This approach not only amplifies the impact of our investments but also promotes risk-sharing and fosters innovative financing solutions tailored to the specific needs of our member countries.

AIIB's commitment to SDG 17 extends beyond finance, encompassing knowledge sharing, capacity building, and the dissemination of best practices. Through our partnerships with think tanks, research institutions, and civil society organizations, we facilitate the exchange of technical expertise, promoting evidence-based policymaking and enhancing the effectiveness of development interventions. By fostering South-South cooperation and triangular cooperation, we leverage the collective wisdom and experiences of diverse stakeholders, ensuring that our projects are contextually relevant and locally owned.

Furthermore, AIIB recognizes the importance of policy coherence and an enabling environment for sustainable development. We actively engage with national governments, regulatory bodies, and multilateral frameworks to promote harmonized policies, streamline procedures, and align institutional frameworks with the principles of SDG 17. This approach fosters an ecosystem conducive to cross-sectoral collaboration, facilitates the transfer of technology and knowledge, and enhances the overall efficiency and effectiveness of development efforts.

To illustrate our commitment, AIIB has actively contributed to the development of sustainable infrastructure projects across Asia, fostering partnerships that transcend national boundaries. For instance, our co-financing arrangement with the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) for the Trans-Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline Project (TANAP) in Azerbaijan and Turkey exemplifies our commitment to leveraging diverse resources and expertise. This project not only enhances regional energy security but also supports the diversification of energy supply routes, promoting economic integration and cooperation among neighboring countries.

Another notable example is AIIB's collaboration with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the European Investment Bank (EIB) in co-financing the Gujarat Rural Roads Project in India. This initiative aims to improve rural connectivity and enhance access to economic opportunities for underserved communities. By pooling resources and knowledge, this partnership has enabled the implementation of innovative road construction techniques, capacity building programs, and community-driven development approaches, contributing to the achievement of multiple SDGs, including SDG 17.

As we look ahead, AIIB remains steadfast in its commitment to SDG 17, recognizing that collective action and global partnerships are indispensable for achieving the transformative vision of the 2030 Agenda. We will continue to leverage our convening power, financial resources, and technical expertise to forge strategic alliances, catalyze cross-border collaborations, and mobilize the means of implementation necessary for sustainable development in Asia and beyond.
