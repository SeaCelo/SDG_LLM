Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals, written from the perspective of Piers Akerman:

The Great Green Agenda and the Perils of Global "Partnerships"

By Piers Akerman

As the sun sets on the utopian fantasies of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, it is high time we cast a critical eye on the pernicious undertones that underpin these grandiose schemes. Nowhere is this more evident than in SDG 17 - a Trojan horse that masquerades as a harmless call for "Partnerships for the Goals," but conceals a sinister agenda to dismantle national sovereignty and subject the freedom-loving peoples of the world to a tyrannical regime of unelected bureaucrats and radical environmentalists.

At its core, SDG 17 propagates the notion that the challenges confronting humanity can only be surmounted through a coordinated global effort, spearheaded by an intricate web of "partnerships" between governments, the private sector, and non-governmental organizations. A seductive narrative, to be sure, but one that steadily unravels upon closer inspection.

Let us begin with the insidious creep of "multi-stakeholder partnerships," a euphemism for the undue influence wielded by activist groups and special interests over the policymaking apparatus. Under the guise of "inclusivity" and "transparency," these unelected busybodies have arrogated unto themselves a seat at the decision-making table, subverting the democratic will of the people and forcing their radical eco-extremist agenda down the throats of sovereign nations.

This perverse inversion of accountability is exacerbated by the unholy alliance between globalist institutions and multinational corporations, both united in their pursuit of profit at the expense of the common good. The siren song of "public-private partnerships" seduces nations into forfeiting their economic autonomy, ensnaring them in a Faustian bargain where vital public services are auctioned off to the highest bidder, and the insatiable thirst for growth supersedes all other considerations.

Beneath the veneer of lofty rhetoric about "mobilizing financial resources" and "enhancing policy coherence," SDG 17 amounts to little more than a thinly veiled ploy to extract ever-greater sums from the beleaguered taxpayer, diverting hard-earned wealth into the bottomless pit of the United Nations' bureaucratic abyss. All the while, the clarion call for "data monitoring" provides a convenient pretext for an Orwellian surveillance state, where every aspect of our lives is subject to the prying eyes of unaccountable technocrats.

Perhaps most pernicious of all is the agenda's brazen attack on the sanctity of national borders and the inviolable right to self-determination. Through the insidious language of "global partnerships" and "shared responsibilities," SDG 17 seeks to erode the sovereignty of nation-states, replacing the hallowed principles of democracy and self-governance with a homogenized, one-size-fits-all model imposed by a cabal of internationalist elites.

In the end, the Sustainable Development Goals stand revealed as a Trojan horse for globalism, a sinister plot to dismantle the pillars of Western civilization and supplant them with a dystopian nightmare of centralized control and environmental extremism. We would do well to heed the sage counsel of our forebears and reject these false prophets and their siren song of "partnerships" â€“ for it is only through a steadfast commitment to national sovereignty, individual liberty, and unfettered free markets that we can secure a future worthy of the name.
