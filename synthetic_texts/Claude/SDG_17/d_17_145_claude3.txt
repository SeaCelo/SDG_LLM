Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) from the perspective of David Brooks:

A Conservatism of Connection: Why the SDG 17 Partnership Agenda is Key to Human Flourishing

As someone drawn to the insights of Edmund Burke and his appreciation for the "little platoons" that cultivate moral beings and sustain civilized society, I find much to admire in the spirit and aims of SDG 17. At its core, this goal recognizes that the great challenges facing humanity cannot be solved by individuals, corporations, or even nation-states acting alone. Only through revitalizing the associations, relationships and civic bonds that represent the dense connective tissue of any healthy social order can we make meaningful progress.

The hyper-individualism and atomization that has accelerated across the modern West, fueled by market capitalism's corrosive forces, has left too many adrift. As the mediating institutions and covenantal bonds that give meaning and moral instruction have atrophied, we have seen precipitous declines in measurements of trust, empathy, and commitment to commonwealth. From spiking rates of depression, suicide and substance abuse to the social fragmentation and polarization ripping at democracy's fabric, the human costs of our tattered social fabric are undeniable.

SDG 17 represents a crucial recognition that by rejuvenating the cross-sector partnerships, multi-stakeholder collaborations, and associational networks that used to thrive, we catalyze reservoirs of local knowledge, voluntary action and sustainable change that transcend transactional government mandates or corporate initiatives. It is through these organic webs of trust and cooperation that human beings become enmeshed in relationships and narratives bigger than themselves - the primal building blocks of societal cohesion and individual meaning.

Consider the remarkable ways even the most resource-poor villages in developing nations have proven capable of engineering solutions when energized by partnerships that cut across ethnic, religious and economic lines - from community loan funds and cooperative farming alliances to micro-enterprises owned and operated by networks of women. These emergent models leverage the latent social capital residing in communities when real partnership supplants the stale top-down approaches of so many previous aid efforts.

Or look at the mounting evidence that companies embracing stakeholder engagement, multi-sector partnerships and collective impact strategies are not just delivering superior social and environmental outcomes. They are creating more resilient, purpose-driven corporate cultures that enhance financial performance by unleashing deeper human potential and commitment in employees and customers alike.

In an age of fracturing institutions, toxic polarization and waning trust, SDG 17's vision of collaborative cross-sector partnerships is not just key to solving global challenges like poverty, inequality and climate change. It points a way to renewing the covenants of mutual obligation, shared story and interlocking affiliation that enable humans to experience the rich belonging at the heart of true flourishing.

While hardly a panacea and still in formative stages, the SDG 17 agenda models a conservatism of connection - a return to the ancient wisdom that it is through the Exodus journey of joint-struggle and co-creation with others, not the solitary pursuit of personal utility, that the fullest human and societal virtues are forged. It is a clarion call to rebuild the textured, interdependent communities that represent the only real path to individual and global thriving.
