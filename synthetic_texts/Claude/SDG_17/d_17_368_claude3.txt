The International Development Law Organization (IDLO) recognizes that the successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development hinges on the ability of countries to foster strong global partnerships and cooperation mechanisms. Sustainable Development Goal 17 (SDG 17) – Partnerships for the Goals – serves as a critical enabler for achieving the remaining 16 Goals, emphasizing the need for collective action, resource mobilization, and policy coherence.

In our assessment, progress towards SDG 17 has been uneven, with both challenges and opportunities emerging across various targets. While there have been promising initiatives and frameworks established, significant gaps remain in areas such as financing, technology transfer, capacity building, and trade facilitation.

One notable achievement has been the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, which provided a comprehensive financing framework for the SDGs. However, the mobilization of resources from both domestic and international sources has fallen short of the projected needs, particularly for developing countries. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated this financing gap, with many countries struggling to allocate sufficient funds for sustainable development initiatives.

On the positive side, the establishment of multi-stakeholder partnerships has gained traction, with various sectors collaborating to address complex development challenges. The United Nations Global Compact, for instance, has brought together businesses, civil society, and governments to align strategies and operations with the SDGs. However, the effectiveness and impact of these partnerships remain variable, highlighting the need for stronger governance frameworks, accountability mechanisms, and measurable targets.

Technology transfer and capacity building have also seen mixed results. While initiatives like the Technology Facilitation Mechanism have facilitated knowledge sharing and technical cooperation, significant barriers persist, such as intellectual property rights, lack of infrastructure, and limited human and financial resources. Developing countries often face challenges in accessing and effectively utilizing cutting-edge technologies, hindering their ability to leapfrog towards sustainable development.

Trade facilitation and policy coherence have been longstanding challenges, with persistent trade barriers, non-tariff measures, and inconsistencies between domestic policies and international commitments. Although the World Trade Organization (WTO) has made efforts to streamline trade procedures and promote policy coherence, progress has been slow, and protectionist tendencies have resurged in recent years.

From a legal perspective, IDLO recognizes the need for robust normative frameworks and effective rule of law institutions to support the implementation of SDG 17. This includes strengthening legal frameworks for public-private partnerships, intellectual property rights, and international investment agreements, among others. Furthermore, enhancing the capacity of national legal systems to align with international norms and standards is crucial for fostering an enabling environment for sustainable development.

Looking ahead, IDLO advocates for a renewed commitment to SDG 17, with a focus on the following key areas:

1. Innovative financing mechanisms: Exploring alternative financing sources, such as blended finance, impact investing, and leveraging the private sector through incentives and regulatory frameworks.

2. Strengthening multi-stakeholder partnerships: Developing clear governance structures, accountability mechanisms, and measurable targets to ensure the effectiveness and impact of partnerships.

3. Facilitating technology transfer: Addressing legal and policy barriers to technology transfer, promoting knowledge sharing, and building capacity in developing countries to effectively adopt and adapt technologies.

4. Trade facilitation and policy coherence: Enhancing legal frameworks for trade facilitation, harmonizing domestic policies with international commitments, and promoting policy coherence across sectors and levels of governance.

5. Capacity building for rule of law institutions: Strengthening the capacity of national legal systems, institutions, and governance frameworks to support the implementation of the SDGs, particularly in areas related to partnerships, financing, and policy coherence.

IDLO recognizes that achieving SDG 17 requires a concerted effort from all stakeholders, including governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector. By fostering strong global partnerships, mobilizing resources, and promoting policy coherence, we can accelerate progress towards the 2030 Agenda and create a more sustainable, equitable, and prosperous world for all.
