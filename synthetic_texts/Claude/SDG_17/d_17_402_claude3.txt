As a leading humanitarian organization dedicated to eradicating global poverty and promoting social justice, CARE recognizes the pivotal role of SDG 17 – Partnerships for the Goals – in catalyzing the transformative change envisioned by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Our extensive field presence and grassroots engagement have reinforced the understanding that achieving the ambitious targets enshrined in the SDGs necessitates a collaborative, multi-stakeholder approach that transcends traditional boundaries and silos.

While commendable progress has been made in mobilizing resources, fostering policy coherence, and promoting multi-stakeholder partnerships, significant challenges persist in operationalizing SDG 17 at the scale and pace required to achieve the transformative vision of the 2030 Agenda. Our analysis reveals a concerning trend of declining official development assistance (ODA) in real terms, particularly from traditional donor countries grappling with economic headwinds and shifting political priorities. This trend poses a significant threat to the resource mobilization efforts underpinning SDG implementation, necessitating a concerted effort to explore innovative financing mechanisms and leverage the untapped potential of the private sector.

Encouragingly, we have witnessed an upsurge in public-private partnerships (PPPs) and blended finance initiatives, leveraging the complementary strengths and resources of diverse stakeholders. However, these initiatives often face regulatory and institutional barriers, as well as persistent power imbalances that undermine their effectiveness and sustainability. Ensuring equitable and inclusive partnerships that amplify the voices of marginalized communities and align with the principles of democratic ownership and accountability remains a formidable challenge.

Moreover, the fragmentation of efforts and lack of policy coherence across sectors and levels of governance continue to impede progress towards SDG 17. Siloed approaches and competing priorities frequently undermine the synergistic potential of the SDGs, hindering the realization of co-benefits and exacerbating trade-offs. Addressing this systemic challenge necessitates a paradigm shift towards integrated, whole-of-government approaches that foster policy coherence and harness the interlinkages between the SDGs.

In the realm of data monitoring and accountability, we commend the efforts to strengthen national statistical capacities and promote the disaggregation of data by income, gender, age, race, ethnicity, migratory status, disability, and geographic location. However, significant data gaps persist, particularly in fragile and conflict-affected contexts, hampering evidence-based policymaking and impeding the effective tracking of progress towards the SDGs. Addressing these gaps requires sustained investments in data ecosystems, leveraging innovative data sources and partnerships with academia, civil society, and the private sector.

Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the vulnerability of our global systems and the imperative of resilience-building. The pandemic's devastating socioeconomic impacts have exacerbated existing inequalities and exposed the fragility of our progress towards the SDGs. As we navigate the recovery phase, it is paramount to prioritize resilient and inclusive partnerships that promote systemic change and address the root causes of vulnerabilities, rather than perpetuating unsustainable and inequitable development trajectories.

In conclusion, while SDG 17 has catalyzed commendable efforts towards fostering partnerships and mobilizing resources, our analysis underscores the need for a renewed and amplified commitment to realizing its transformative potential. Achieving the SDGs will require a concerted effort to mobilize innovative financing, promote policy coherence, strengthen data ecosystems, and foster inclusive, equitable, and resilient partnerships that empower marginalized communities and address systemic barriers to sustainable development. CARE remains steadfast in its commitment to collaborating with diverse stakeholders, amplifying grassroots voices, and advocating for the transformative change envisioned by the 2030 Agenda.
