Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals), written from the perspective of Dennis Prager:

The 17th Sustainable Development Goal of the United Nations - "Revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development" - represents one of the greatest challenges facing the world today. At its core, this goal recognizes that achieving the other 16 SDGs requires unprecedented cooperation and collaboration among nations, across both public and private sectors. 

However, the notion of a "global partnership" runs counter to the values of nationalism and self-interest that I believe should guide national policy for sovereign countries. The United Nations and its push for globalization pose a threat to American constitutional democracy and our long-held tradition of limited government power.

Any "global partnership" inevitably concentrates authority and decision-making into the hands of unelected international bureaucrats and obfuscates accountability to citizens. This UN-led agenda for worldwide coordination and wealth redistribution undermines national sovereignty and self-determination. The SDGs as a whole have been criticized as a vehicle for larger government, higher taxes, economy-distorting regulations, and disproportionate US funding obligations.

Rather than cede authority to unaccountable global institutions, the United States should pursue its national interests through binding bilateral or multilateral agreements that preserve American leadership and protect our constitutional rights. We should be highly selective about international agreements and partnerships we enter into.

Moreover, the SDGs improperly conflate diverse policy aims across economic, environmental, and social domains into one monolithic agenda. By holding all 17 goals as equally important priorities, the SDGs fail to rationally evaluate trade-offs or set coherent, realistic national objectives. The marketplace and democratic self-governance provide far better mechanisms for weighing ethical interests and fairly balancing inevitable policy conflicts.

It's particularly troubling that the SDGs were developed and enacted through non-democratic, non-transparent UN processes with minimal public input or accountability. They represent an imposition of elite values and technocratic central planning. The SDGs subordinate essential principles like personal liberty, property rights, and free market capitalism to a utopian vision of total social and environmental control.

While the 17 goals contain some reasonable ideas, the final SDG promoting a "global partnership" should be firmly rejected by the United States. We must fiercely guard our national sovereignty and democratic values against encroachments from international organizations and their radical agendas.

Sustainable development need not come at the cost of our most cherished American ideals and institutions. Binding ourselves to misguided "partnerships" for global aims only hastens our nation's decline. The United States can better promote human flourishing around the world by leading through strength, example and powerful bilateral relations - not sacrificing our sovereignty on the altar of globalism.
