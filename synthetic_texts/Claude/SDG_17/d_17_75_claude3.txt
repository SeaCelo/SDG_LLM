Here is a detailed, academic-style article about Sustainable Development Goal 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) from the perspective of conservative author Mark Steyn:

The Utopian Folly of Global Partnerships

By Mark Steyn

The grand delusion of the United Nations' Agenda 2030 and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals is that a few lofty proclamations jotted down on parchment in Helvetica can bend the arc of human affairs. But as usual with these supranational pipe dreams, the devil is in the details - or in this case, the lack thereof. 

Take SDG 17, cynically dubbed "Partnerships for the Goals," which might as well be labeled "The More The Merrier" for its woollier-than-thou generalities. At its core is a utopian fantasy of globalists run amok - that the complex dynamics of geopolitics, sovereign priorities, and disparate national interests can somehow be homogenized through promiscuous "partnerships." How very Brussels of them.

The agenda prattles on about "enhancing the global partnership for sustainable development" through the "mobilization of resources." Yet for all their lofty rhetoric about financial flows, debt relief, investment promotion, and technology transfer, it's a top-down boondoggle predicated on the perpetual expansion of statism under the fraudulent banner of "sustainability."

How telling that sub-goal 17.9 prioritizes "enhancing international support for implementing effective and targeted capacity-building" - UN bureaucratese for centralizing more power, control, and funding in their own bloated bureaucracies. As if the last failed half-century of foreign aid grifting wasn't already incentive enough.

And what of SDG 17.14's quaint appeal to "enhance policy coherence for sustainable development?" Let's be clear: They're hawking one-size-fits-all policy diktats to be imposed on nation-states that still believe in small government and economic freedom.

Mark my words, what passes for "partnerships" in UN-speak is just a euphemism for circumventing national sovereignty and popular consent. After all, it was global potentates who foisted these goals on the peoples of the world with no democratic process.

For example, consider the explicit targets for internet access and usage under 17.6 and 17.8 - or, as I'd call them, partnerships for state surveillance and censorship. Oh, they couch it in silken lies about enhancing "knowledge sharing" and promoting "universal internet access." But in practice, it lays the groundwork for bureaucratic overlords to control what information people can access online.

And that's to say nothing of the grand irony that many of the most repressive basket-case regimes were allowed a seat at the table in drafting these inane goals. Are we meant to believe that Saudi Arabia, Russia, and China - charter members of the Brutality for Censorship Club - have any intention of honoring 17.6? I suppose that line will be omitted from their "translations."

Then there's the repeated fetishization of "data monitoring and accountability" scattered throughout SDG 17. Read between the lines and you'll detect the rotten smell of bureaucratic intrusion, state-sanctioned voyeurism, and an insatiable appetite for centralized control.

At the end of the day, these "Partnerships for the Goals" are a Trojan horse for bypassing popular consent and nationhood itself. The path may be paved with lofty clich√©s about prosperity, peace, and human rights. But the final destination is a borderless, stateless, neo-feudal hive where all is permitted to an unaccountable cadre of philosopher-kings seeking to impose top-down command and control in perpetuity.

No thanks. If the price of UN utopia is the steady erosion of individual liberty, self-determination, and human flourishing, then it's a price too steep to pay. Sustainable Development Goal 17 is better renamed "Pipe Dreams for Central Planners." And the only coherent policy is to consign it to the ash heap of history.
