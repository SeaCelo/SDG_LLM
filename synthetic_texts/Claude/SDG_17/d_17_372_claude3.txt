The International Organization for Migration (IOM) recognizes the pivotal role of SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) in achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, particularly in the context of migration governance. As a leading intergovernmental organization in the field of migration, IOM is strategically positioned to leverage its extensive network and expertise to foster partnerships that catalyze progress on this transformative goal.

SDG 17 calls for revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable development, encompassing finance, technology, capacity-building, trade, and systemic issues. In the realm of migration, this goal underscores the need for collective action and shared responsibility among stakeholders at all levels â€“ governments, civil society, the private sector, and international organizations.

IOM's multi-stakeholder approach is critical in addressing the multidimensional challenges and opportunities associated with migration. Through its global presence and deep-rooted relationships with Member States, IOM facilitates dialogues, knowledge exchange, and collaborative efforts to enhance migration governance and promote the well-being of migrants and societies.

One key area where IOM's partnership efforts are pivotal is in mobilizing financial resources for migration-related initiatives. IOM's expertise in engaging with diverse donors, including governments, multilateral organizations, and the private sector, has enabled the Organization to secure funding for programs that support migrants, build capacity, and promote sustainable development in countries of origin, transit, and destination.

IOM's partnerships with the private sector are particularly noteworthy. By leveraging the resources, expertise, and innovative solutions of the private sector, IOM has implemented initiatives that foster ethical recruitment practices, support migrant entrepreneurship, and promote the integration of migrants into host communities. These collaborations exemplify the potential of multi-stakeholder partnerships in achieving sustainable development objectives related to migration.

Furthermore, IOM's extensive network of Country Offices and Regional Offices enables the Organization to engage with local communities, civil society organizations, and grassroots movements. These partnerships are crucial in ensuring that migration policies and programs are context-specific, inclusive, and responsive to the needs of migrant populations.

Capacity-building is another area where IOM's partnerships have made significant strides. Through collaborative efforts with academic institutions, research centers, and training organizations, IOM has developed and delivered specialized training programs for government officials, practitioners, and civil society actors. These initiatives have enhanced the knowledge and skills necessary for effective migration management, promoting evidence-based policymaking and fostering a culture of cooperation.

IOM's commitment to data and research has also contributed to strengthening partnerships for the Goals. By collaborating with research institutions, think tanks, and international organizations, IOM has advanced the understanding of migration dynamics, trends, and impacts. This evidence-based approach has informed policy dialogues, facilitated knowledge sharing, and supported the development of innovative solutions to address migration-related challenges.

Moreover, IOM's engagement with regional and global processes, such as the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration and the Global Forum on Migration and Development, has fostered multi-stakeholder dialogues and partnerships. These platforms have facilitated the exchange of best practices, identified gaps and opportunities, and fostered collective action towards achieving migration-related targets within the Sustainable Development Goals.

While significant progress has been made, IOM recognizes the need for sustained efforts and continued partnerships to fully realize the potential of SDG 17 in the context of migration governance. Challenges such as limited resources, capacity gaps, and political complexities persist, requiring innovative and collaborative approaches.

IOM remains committed to leveraging its extensive network, expertise, and partnerships to accelerate progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals related to migration. By fostering multi-stakeholder collaborations, mobilizing resources, and promoting knowledge exchange, IOM contributes to the global effort of leaving no one behind and ensuring that migration is a driver of sustainable development.
