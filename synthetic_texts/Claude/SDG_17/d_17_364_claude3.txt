The European Investment Bank (EIB) recognizes the pivotal role of Sustainable Development Goal 17 (SDG 17) in catalyzing global partnerships and mobilizing resources to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. As a policy-driven financial institution, the EIB is well-positioned to facilitate multi-stakeholder collaborations, leverage innovative financing mechanisms, and promote capacity-building initiatives to address the complex challenges encompassed by SDG 17.

At the heart of SDG 17 lies the acknowledgment that sustainable development cannot be achieved by any single entity or nation-state alone. It necessitates a concerted effort involving diverse actors, including governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector. The EIB has actively engaged in forging strategic partnerships with various stakeholders, recognizing the complementary strengths and resources each party brings to the table.

One notable example is the EIB's collaboration with the European Commission and the United Nations to establish the External Investment Plan (EIP). This ambitious initiative aims to leverage public and private investments to address root causes of migration and promote sustainable development in partner countries. Through the EIP, the EIB has mobilized substantial financial resources, leveraging its expertise in project finance and risk-sharing mechanisms to catalyze investments in critical sectors such as infrastructure, renewable energy, and private sector development.

Moreover, the EIB has been a pioneer in developing innovative financing instruments that align with the principles of SDG 17. The Green Bond program, launched in 2007, has enabled the Bank to tap into the growing market for sustainable investments, raising funds specifically earmarked for environmentally sustainable projects. By fostering transparency and accountability, the Green Bond program has attracted a diverse range of investors, from institutional investors to environmentally conscious individuals, further strengthening global partnerships for sustainable development.

Capacity-building and knowledge-sharing are integral components of SDG 17, and the EIB has been actively engaged in these endeavors. Through its technical assistance programs, the Bank provides advisory services, training, and expertise to partner countries and project promoters, enhancing their ability to design, implement, and manage sustainable development projects effectively. This transfer of knowledge and best practices contributes to building resilient institutions and fostering an enabling environment for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.

Furthermore, the EIB recognizes the importance of data, monitoring, and accountability in tracking progress towards SDG 17 and the broader 2030 Agenda. The Bank has established robust monitoring and evaluation frameworks to assess the impact of its operations and ensure alignment with sustainable development objectives. By embracing transparency and accountability, the EIB fosters trust among stakeholders and demonstrates its commitment to delivering tangible results.

Looking ahead, the EIB remains steadfast in its commitment to fostering global partnerships and mobilizing resources to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. The Bank will continue to leverage its financial expertise, convening power, and collaborative spirit to catalyze transformative change. This includes exploring innovative financing models, such as blended finance and impact investing, to mobilize private capital for sustainable development initiatives.

Moreover, the EIB recognizes the need to strengthen partnerships with the private sector, harnessing its entrepreneurial spirit, technological innovations, and market-driven approaches. By fostering public-private collaborations, the Bank can unlock new avenues for sustainable development, leveraging the complementary strengths of diverse stakeholders.

In the face of global challenges such as climate change, poverty, and inequalities, the EIB remains resolute in its pursuit of SDG 17. Through strategic partnerships, innovative financing mechanisms, and capacity-building initiatives, the Bank will continue to play a pivotal role in mobilizing resources and fostering collective action towards a more sustainable and equitable future for all.
