Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) from the perspective of journalist Heather Mallick:

The Perpetual Partnerships Paradox: Lip Service or Concrete Commitments for the SDGs?

By Heather Mallick

Once again, the wealthy nations have convened to congratulate themselves on being such good global citizens while simultaneously falling utterly short on their promised commitments. The 17th Sustainable Development Goal of revitalizing global partnerships sounds so marvellously unifying in theory. Yet in practice, the rhetoric around "partnerships" remains as empty as a Donald Trump re-election promise. 

Let's start with the financial component. The long-standing UN target for developed countries is to commit 0.7% of their gross national income to official development assistance (ODA). A embarrassingly modest goal, you'd think it would be simple enough to achieve for nations purporting to be world leaders. And yet, the vast majority still can't be bothered. Only a handful persistently meet this level, with the miserable United States lingering at a pathetic 0.18%. No amount of lofty language about "multi-stakeholder partnerships" can obfuscate this fundamental moral failing.

Perhaps the global community simply needs firmer "accountability mechanisms," as the UN delicately puts it. Because the track record on following through is nothing short of shameful. Remember those grand pledges to support the COVAX program and ensure equitable global vaccine distribution? Well, look how swimmingly that turned out, with the world's poorest set to be last in line yet again as wealthy countries hoarded doses. It's the same old story of the global elite patting themselves on the back while utterly neglecting those most in need.

Even in the realm of technical cooperation and knowledge sharing, where the impediments are less financial, the record is pitiful. The global trading system remains heavily rigged in favor of rich nations propping up domestic industries instead of helping build capacity and resilience abroad. Coherent policy environments remain mythical creatures, with different arms of government frequently working at cross-purposes. And God forbid we prioritize overcoming the grotesque tax evasion depriving developing countries of hundreds of billions annually in lost revenue.

Of course, all of this obstructionism gets cloaked in the soothing language of "country ownership," as if this were truly a matter of respecting national sovereignty instead of powerful nations dictating terms. The sustainable development agenda is endlessly framed as "pro-poor" while stubbornly perpetuating the status quo of imbalanced global power dynamics. For all the talk of "inclusive partnerships" and a "revitalized global partnership," the outdated top-down model of unilateral conditionality sadly persists.

At the end of the day, SDG 17 boils down to a staggeringly unambitious request: that the world's most influential nations apportion a respectable level of support and refrain from rank hypocrisy in their policies and conduct. Yet time after time, they fail to clear even this lowest of bars. Global partnerships were always going to be the most challenging goal given the interests at stake, but the lack of integrity and commitment remains breathtaking.

So by all means, let the self-congratulatory rhetoric about "multi-stakeholder global partnerships" continue. Just don't mistake it for meaningful progress. When it comes to matching fine words with tangible actions, the global community remains perpetually stumped. Perhaps some genuine moral leadership and political courage could finally break the cycle. But I won't hold my breath.
