Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 17 (Partnerships for the Goals), written from the perspective of Jonah Goldberg:

The Pursuit of Global Governance: The Fallacies of SDG 17

By Jonah Goldberg

When the United Nations adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in 2015, it boldly enshrined 17 lofty goals as a "blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all." The 17th of these goals - reviving the global partnership for sustainable development - encapsulates the agenda's fundamental flaw: an unbridled faith in globalization and top-down transnational governance as preeminent virtues.  

At its core, SDG 17 is a thinly veiled campaign for increased multilateralism under the rubric of "sustainability." It calls for an ambiguous "global partnership" that enhances policy coherence, mobilizes financial resources, promotes multi-stakeholder partnerships, and strengthens the UN's data monitoring capacities. Yet, this master plan to "revitalize the global partnership" reeks of ideological baggage and technocratic hubris.

The proponents of SDG 17 peddle the illusion that global challenges require global governance - that self-interested nation-states are incapable of collaborative problem-solving without binding multilateral institutions and treaties. This narrative rests on the philosophical underpinnings of Wilsonian idealism, presupposing that parochial national interests are the root cause of conflict and that permanent institutions can impose order, rationality and collective interests. However, this progressive dream of top-down harmonization consistently crumbles against the immutable realities of human nature.

The utopians behind Agenda 2030 lament that "no one is fully capturing the increasing integration of economies." But this lament stems from the erroneous premise that hyper-globalization is universally desirable. Market liberalization has enabled unprecedented economic growth, lifting billions out of poverty. However, the cultural, political and security implications of unrestrained globalization remain hotly debated. Sovereign states, rooted in national identities and communal interests, cannot simply be dissolved into a borderless global governance structure at the whims of bureaucratic social engineers.

Moreover, the plea for mobilizing "additional financial resources from multiple sources" is a thinly veiled call for greater redistributionism - siphoning wealth from productive nations to regimes plagued by corruption, instability and underdevelopment. This Faustian bargain has repeatedly failed to spur sustainable economic progress in impoverished regions, instead greasing the kleptocratic machinery of inept governments.  

At its core, SDG 17 is an apostolic hymn to globalism - a feeble attempt to reconstitute a fraying liberal international order. It presumes that global challenges, ranging from climate change to healthcare emergencies, require revolutionary shifts towards transnational institutionalism and technocracy. However, history is replete with examples of such universalist fantasies devolving into authoritarian nightmares.

While the SDGs ostensibly espouse motherhood principles of human rights, democratic governance and environmental stewardship, the road to that putative utopia is paved with centralized control, wealth redistribution and the gradual erosion of national sovereignty. SDG 17 is yet another Trojan horse for institutionalizing global government by unaccountable elites under the guise of solving humanity's woes.

The undeterred march towards a globalized new world order, codified in lofty platitudes like SDG 17, must be viewed with sober realism. As a famous American president warned, "no compact among nations can diminish our sovereignty." Global challenges are best resolved through sovereign cooperation, enlightened self-interests and organic competition - not bureaucratic diktats issued by a secular papacy of stakeholders and experts.

Humanity's quest for sustainable progress and peaceful coexistence is perverted, not advanced, by utopian schemes for radical multilateralism. SDG 17 epitomizes that dangerous mentality - it must be rejected for what it truly represents: a Nietzschean will to global power masquerading as altruistic utopianism.
