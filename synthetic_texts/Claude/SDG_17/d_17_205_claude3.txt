Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 17 (Partnerships for the Goals), written from the perspective of the late economist Walter E. Williams:

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals have garnered much attention and fanfare over the past several years. While some of the goals seem benign or even laudable at face value, such as ending poverty and hunger, we must carefully examine both the stated objectives and the proposed means of achieving them. Goal 17 - to "revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development" - is particularly concerning from an economic freedom perspective.

The architects of the SDGs posit that increased global governance, wealth redistribution from rich to poor nations, and expanded regulatory regimes are the pathways to sustainable development. This is the antithesis of the free market capitalism and respect for property rights that has lifted billions out of poverty over the past two centuries. Let's analyze the insidious implications of SDG 17's targets.

One target calls for "enhancing global macroeconomic policy coordination and policy coherence for sustainable development." In plain English, this is a push for global economic central planning under the guise of altruism. The atrocious track record of centrally-planned economies, from the Soviet Union to modern-day Venezuela, demonstrates that such unconstrained power in the hands of bureaucrats inevitably leads to shortages, corruption, and human rights abuses.  

Another target promotes an "open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system." This sounds appealing on its face, but a deeper look reveals an attack on national sovereignty. It is simply a pathway towards submitting American trade policies - and by extension, our economic freedom - to unelected, unaccountable international organizations and bureaucracies like the UN and WTO. The American constitutional republic was established precisely to preserve liberties against such tyranny.

Perhaps most pernicious is the call for "additional financial resources" through "foreign direct investment" and increased financial flows to fund this grandiose agenda. Do not be fooled - this is a clarion call for wealth redistribution through aggressive taxation and subjugation of property rights, the very rights that are a foundational source of prosperity.  

At its core, SDG 17 is an assault on limited government, economic liberty, and personal autonomy under the thin veil of altruism. Its advocates erroneously claim that only a vast network of global taxation, regulation, and economic central planning can facilitate the goals of ending societal ills like poverty and hunger.  

However, the spectacular poverty reduction achievements in Asia over recent decades occurred precisely because nations like China, India and others embraced market reforms and economic freedom to some degree, not through submitting to transnational governance pushed by Western elites and NGOs. Billions of people have been lifted out of extreme poverty as a result.

The voluntary underpinnings of free market capitalism, not coercive centralized economic plans imposed by bureaucrats, are what have allowed humanity to flourish. SDG 17 threatens this progress in the name of equality of outcome rather than equality of opportunity. It must be rejected in favor of policies that protect individual and economic freedoms. Sustainable development can only be achieved through the entrepreneurial spirit of free peoples, not by sacrificing liberties in a utopian global agenda.
