Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 17 written from the perspective of Gene Weingarten:

Partnerships to Achieve the Goal: An Exercise in Comedic Cynicism 

When the esteemed members of the United Nations General Assembly voted to adopt the 17 Sustainable Development Goals back in 2015, the atmosphere was one of optimistic idealism. These lofty objectives, designed to build a better world by 2030, were touted as an unprecedented and transformative vision to uplift the global poor, protect the planet, and foster peace and prosperity. I imagine diplomats from around the globe patting themselves on the back for their magnanimous humanitarianism.

Then they got to Goal 17: Revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development. Let's call a spade a spade here, folks. This wasn't an inspiring call to action. It was a naked plea to avoid going it alone on the 16 other impossibly daunting challenges they had just signed up for. It's akin to voluntarily running a marathon, then desperately seeking to form a partnership with people who have cars to drive you part of the way.

Look, I'm not knocking the intent behind this goal. Bringing together governments, civil society, the private sector, and others to combine resources and knowledge could theoretically accelerate progress. But let's be real – have you met humans lately? We're a hopelessly selfish, greedy, shortsighted bunch consistently outmaneuvered by our own pettiness. The prospect of achieving "policy coherence for sustainable development" as prescribed by this goal is about as likely as Kevin Hart winning the WNBA Slam Dunk contest.

To illustrate, consider SDG Target 17.14: Enhance policy coherence for sustainable development. I've worked in Washington, D.C. long enough to tell you that this directive will go over like an aluminum siding salesmen at a nude beach. Our deeply polarized political system can barely agree that oxygen is necessary for survival, let alone harmonize a dizzying array of economic, social and environmental policies. And that's just within our borders. Expecting coherent international consensus is like herding chaos theory into a plastic baggie.

Speaking of other nations, one needs only to look at Target 17.2 – committing developed countries to spend 0.7% of gross national income on aid to developing countries – to see how hideously this is all going. In 2020, only 7 countries hit that frankly paltry number. Way to dream big with that ambitious goal, folks! You really swung for the fences on that one. 

I could go on lampooning the naively idealistic targets involving debt sustainability, investment promotion, technology transfer, and capacity building for statistics. But I suspect I've painted a vivid enough picture of how SDG 17 epitomizes what can happen when well-intentioned individuals get a bit too intoxicated on utopian thinking. It becomes a feel-good word salad of nebulous concepts disastrously disengaged from reality.

Does that mean we shouldn't even try for greater international cooperation and innovative partnerships? Of course not – that's akin to the existential despair of deciding not to get dressed because we're all going to die someday anyway. I'm simply saying we should check our rose-colored glasses at the door and speak some hard truths about our individual and institutional capacities for self-serving buffoonery.

Besides, a hefty dose of comedic cynicism may be just what we need to counterbalance our chronic human propensity for misguided sanctimony and hubris. It's an acknowledgment that lasting change is hard. Like, stubbing your toe on the bedpost hard. It'll likely be fortunate if the global community can manage to develop a few reasonably effective public-private partnership pilots by 2030 instead of revolutionizing the entire paradigm.

So yes, let's keep working towards SDG 17. Just don't be shocked if the main "revitalized partnership" is simply reaffirming our stubborn will as a species to keep grudgingly muddling along despite our glaring flaws. Sometimes, that's the best we can do. It may not be inspirational, but accepting that reality could be a crucial first step towards actually making headway.
