As the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), we present this analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 17 (SDG 17), with a particular focus on the challenges faced by least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs).

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development recognizes that the successful implementation of the SDGs hinges on revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable development, as encapsulated in SDG 17. This goal aims to strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development, addressing finance, technology, capacity-building, trade, and systemic issues.

For LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs, the path towards achieving the SDGs is fraught with unique and formidable challenges. These countries often grapple with structural vulnerabilities, limited resources, and capacity constraints that hinder their ability to mobilize the necessary means for sustainable development.

LDCs, which comprise some of the poorest and most vulnerable nations, face acute challenges in mobilizing domestic resources, attracting foreign direct investment (FDI), and accessing affordable financing. Many LDCs are heavily reliant on official development assistance (ODA), which has stagnated in recent years, falling short of the commitments made by developed countries. The lack of adequate and predictable financing impedes progress across various SDGs, including poverty eradication, quality education, and access to basic services.

SIDS, characterized by their small size, remoteness, and vulnerability to climate change and natural disasters, confront unique challenges in achieving sustainable development. These countries often have narrow economic bases, limited diversification opportunities, and high dependence on international trade and tourism. The impact of climate change exacerbates their vulnerabilities, threatening their economies, livelihoods, and very existence. Addressing these challenges requires innovative financing mechanisms, technology transfer, and capacity-building support to build resilience and promote sustainable development pathways.

LLDCs face distinct challenges stemming from their lack of territorial access to the sea and remoteness from major markets. High trade costs, underdeveloped transport infrastructure, and limited integration into global value chains hinder their economic growth and development prospects. Enhancing regional connectivity, improving trade facilitation, and promoting diversification are critical for these countries to achieve sustainable development and participate effectively in the global economy.

To address these challenges, UNCTAD calls for concerted efforts from all stakeholders to revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development:

1. Mobilizing resources: Developed countries must honor their ODA commitments and explore innovative financing mechanisms, such as blended finance and public-private partnerships, to catalyze investments in LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs. Domestic resource mobilization efforts should be supported through capacity-building, improved tax administration, and combating illicit financial flows.

2. Facilitating technology transfer: Bridging the technological divide is crucial for these countries to leapfrog and achieve sustainable development. Strengthening international cooperation, promoting technology transfer on favorable terms, and supporting local innovation ecosystems are essential steps in this regard.

3. Enhancing trade opportunities: Improving market access for LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs through preferential trade agreements, reducing non-tariff barriers, and promoting regional integration can boost their economic growth and development prospects. Strengthening their productive capacities and diversifying their economies are also imperative for their effective integration into global value chains.

4. Strengthening capacities: Capacity-building efforts should focus on enhancing human resources, institutional frameworks, and policy coherence to enable these countries to effectively implement the SDGs and address their unique vulnerabilities. South-South and triangular cooperation can play a pivotal role in this regard.

5. Addressing systemic issues: Reforming the global financial architecture, enhancing the voice and representation of LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs in decision-making processes, and promoting policy coherence for sustainable development are crucial to creating an enabling environment for achieving the SDGs.

UNCTAD recognizes the heterogeneity among LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs and the need for tailored solutions that address their specific challenges and contexts. Effective implementation of SDG 17 requires a renewed commitment from all stakeholders, including developed countries, international organizations, the private sector, and civil society, to foster genuine and durable partnerships that leave no one behind.

Through coordinated efforts, innovative approaches, and a shared sense of responsibility, we can collectively address the unique challenges faced by LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs, and pave the way for a more inclusive, sustainable, and prosperous future for all.
