The Journal of Financial Economics is honored to present this comprehensive analysis of Sustainable Development Goal 17 (SDG 17), which focuses on strengthening the means of implementation and revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable development. This goal lies at the heart of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, acting as a catalyst for mobilizing resources, fostering international cooperation, and promoting an enabling environment for sustainable economic growth.

SDG 17 recognizes that achieving the ambitious targets set forth by the United Nations necessitates a concerted effort from all stakeholders, including governments, private sector entities, civil society organizations, and academic institutions. The goal emphasizes the critical role of finance in addressing global challenges and highlights the need for innovative financing mechanisms to bridge the investment gap.

One of the key targets of SDG 17 is to strengthen domestic resource mobilization, including through international support to developing countries, to improve their capacity for tax and other revenue collection. This target underscores the importance of robust fiscal systems and effective tax policies in generating sustainable domestic resources for development. Governments must prioritize measures to combat illicit financial flows, curb tax evasion and avoidance, and enhance the transparency and accountability of financial institutions.

Furthermore, SDG 17 calls for the mobilization of additional financial resources for developing countries from multiple sources, including foreign direct investment (FDI), official development assistance (ODA), and remittances. Facilitating an enabling environment for private sector investment through public-private partnerships (PPPs) and blended finance models is crucial for leveraging the necessary capital to finance sustainable development initiatives.

The goal also emphasizes the need for enhanced policy coherence and an enabling environment at all levels for sustainable development. This requires coordination among national, regional, and international policies to ensure alignment with the 2030 Agenda and effective implementation of sustainable development strategies. Regulatory frameworks must be adapted to incentivize sustainable business practices, promote responsible investment, and foster innovation in green finance.

SDG 17 recognizes the critical role of technology transfer and capacity-building in supporting developing countries. Access to affordable and sustainable technologies, particularly in areas such as renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, and clean water and sanitation, is essential for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Initiatives that foster knowledge-sharing, technology transfer, and capacity-building through North-South, South-South, and triangular regional and international cooperation are vital for bridging the technological divide.

Another significant aspect of SDG 17 is the promotion of a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory, and equitable multilateral trading system under the World Trade Organization (WTO). This target highlights the importance of international trade as an engine for economic growth and sustainable development. By promoting fair trade practices, reducing trade barriers, and fostering an enabling environment for export-oriented industries, countries can leverage the potential of global markets to drive economic diversification and job creation.

Finally, SDG 17 underscores the importance of data, monitoring, and accountability for the successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda. High-quality, timely, and reliable data disaggregated by income, gender, age, race, ethnicity, migratory status, disability, geographic location, and other characteristics are essential for evidence-based policymaking and measuring progress toward the SDGs. This requires strengthening national statistical capacities, leveraging new data sources and technologies, and fostering international cooperation and partnerships for data sharing and analytics.

In conclusion, SDG 17 serves as a catalyst for mobilizing resources, fostering international cooperation, and promoting an enabling environment for sustainable economic growth. By addressing systemic issues related to finance, trade, technology transfer, capacity-building, and data monitoring, this goal provides a framework for revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable development. Achieving SDG 17 requires a concerted effort from all stakeholders, including governments, private sector entities, civil society organizations, and academic institutions, to mobilize the necessary resources, foster innovation, and promote inclusive, sustainable economic growth worldwide.
