Here goes, a long academic article about SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) in the irreverent and satirical style of Dave Barry:

The 17th Sustainable Development Goal: Because the First 16 Weren't Ambitious Enough

Listen up, folks. We've got 16 noble Sustainable Development Goals focused on eliminating poverty, protecting the environment, and achieving world peace through the thankless work of the United Nations. You'd think that would be enough lofty idealism to choke a hydrogen-fueled Prius. But no, some bureaucrats got together and said "You know what this complex global agenda needs? Another goal! A Metagoal, if you will. An infinite recursive black hole of a goal that's all about achieving the other goals." 

Welcome to SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals. Its mission? To mobilize a vast network of multi-stakeholder partnerships that can throw billions of dollars, millions of labor hours, and countless Zoom meetings at the first 16 goals until they are achieved through sheer brute force partnership-ing. Need to end hunger? Partners! Quality education? More partners! Just keep partnering until the problems go away!

The key partners envisioned include civil society, the multilateral system, the private sector, philanthropic entities, and any other organizational entities desperate enough to sign up. Basically, it's the Oprah of sustainability goals: "You get a partner! And you get a partner! EVERYBODY GETS A PARTNER!" 

To grease the wheels of this partnerpalooza, SDG 17 calls for more money, more data, more policy coherence, and a Titanic's deck chair's worth of "capacity building" and "knowledge sharing." Because obviously the reason we can't solve global hunger is that the starving kids haven't attended enough PowerPoint webinars.

The goal even has 19 specific metrics to measure progress, including tax revenue, debt sustainability, Internet usage, and parliamentary representation ratios. It's like the UN said "You want metrics? We'll give you all the metrics! Metrics until your eyes bleed!" Although, to be fair, some of the metrics do aim at important issues like foreign aid flows and investment promotion regimes. Snore.

Now, call me a cynic, but this entire "Goal to enable the Goals" seems like a classic case of piling on more unnecessary bureaucracy. Do we really need a separate call for nations, NGOs, and companies to "enhance the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development" when the whole point of the other 16 goals was sustainable development in the first place? Isn't that what we were supposedly already partnering for? It's like having one of your New Year's resolutions be "Make More Resolutions."

That said, SDG 17 does helpfully remind us that solving humanity's greatest challenges will require cooperation across all sectors of society. Although I would have phrased it more like "Listen up, everyone - we're all in this flaming hand-basket together, so let's join forces before we're all living in huts and fighting over the last pouch of Capri Sun." 

At any rate, achieving SDG 17 appears to involve a perpetual merry-go-round of working groups, conferences, policy papers, empowerment seminars, transnational dialogues, and other thrilling activities where people drink bad coffee and debate language for participatory monitoring frameworks. But hey, at least they'll have achieved that elusive "multi-stakeholder partnership" to make it all worthwhile.

So there you have it: the most meta of all Sustainable Development Goals. Does it represent bold, transformative thinking or just more quasi-spiritual rubric-slinging? You decide! Although in true UN fashion, by the time you've decided the goal's target date will have come and gone, leaving humanity to ponder the deep existential question: If we achieved a partnership to achieve goals, but didn't actually achieve the goals, did we really achieve anything?  Ponder that while I go calculate my planetary boundary intersectionality score.
