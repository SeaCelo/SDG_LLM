United Purpose's Report on SDG 17: Revitalizing the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has ushered in an era of unprecedented global cooperation, with SDG 17 serving as the catalyst for mobilizing the resources and partnerships required to achieve the ambitious goals. However, as we approach the halfway mark, it is evident that the progress has been uneven and fraught with challenges.

One of the core tenets of SDG 17 is the revitalization of the global partnership for sustainable development, encompassing diverse stakeholders from governments, civil society, the private sector, and international organizations. While there have been notable strides in fostering multi-stakeholder partnerships, the scale and impact of these collaborations remain inadequate to tackle the multifaceted challenges of sustainable development.

The financing landscape presents a formidable obstacle. Despite commitments from developed nations to allocate 0.7% of their gross national income (GNI) to official development assistance (ODA), only a handful of countries have met this target. The shortfall in funding has impeded progress across various SDGs, particularly in least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing states (SIDS), which disproportionately bear the brunt of global challenges such as climate change, poverty, and conflict.

Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing inequalities and reversed hard-won gains, underscoring the need for a more robust and resilient global partnership. The pandemic has highlighted the fragility of global supply chains, the interdependence of economies, and the necessity for coordinated international action to address cross-border challenges.

Addressing these challenges requires a recalibration of the global partnership, with a focus on innovative financing mechanisms, enhanced policy coherence, and strengthened multi-stakeholder collaboration. One promising avenue is the leveraging of blended finance, which combines public and private resources to catalyze investments in sustainable development projects. Additionally, the promotion of domestic resource mobilization, through improved tax administration and combating illicit financial flows, can provide a sustainable source of funding for developing countries.

Policy coherence is another critical aspect of SDG 17, as siloed approaches and conflicting policies undermine progress towards sustainable development. This requires a whole-of-government approach, where policies across sectors are aligned with the SDGs, and a whole-of-society approach, where stakeholders from various backgrounds contribute to policymaking processes.

Moreover, the global partnership must prioritize capacity-building and technology transfer, particularly in areas such as renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, and digital infrastructure. This can be achieved through strengthened North-South, South-South, and triangular cooperation, leveraging the expertise and resources of various countries and regions.

Lastly, the role of the private sector in achieving the SDGs cannot be overstated. By aligning business strategies with sustainable development principles and embracing responsible investment practices, the private sector can be a powerful catalyst for positive change. However, this requires a conducive regulatory environment, incentives for sustainable practices, and robust public-private partnerships.

As we navigate the complexities of the 21st century, the global partnership for sustainable development must evolve to meet the challenges head-on. By fostering inclusive multi-stakeholder collaboration, mobilizing innovative financing mechanisms, promoting policy coherence, and leveraging the complementary strengths of various actors, we can revitalize the global partnership and accelerate progress towards the ambitious targets of the 2030 Agenda.
