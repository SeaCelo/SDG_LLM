Strengthening the means of implementation and revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable development is a multifaceted endeavor that requires a concerted effort from all stakeholders. Helpage International, an organization dedicated to promoting the rights and well-being of older persons, recognizes the pivotal role that SDG 17 plays in achieving the ambitious 2030 Agenda.

The global demographic shift towards an aging population poses significant challenges, particularly in developing countries, where resources are already strained. Ensuring that older persons are not left behind in the pursuit of sustainable development necessitates a holistic approach that addresses their unique needs and vulnerabilities. This requires a strengthening of the global partnership for sustainable development, fostering collaboration among governments, civil society organizations, the private sector, and international institutions.

One of the key targets of SDG 17 is to mobilize additional financial resources for developing countries from various sources, including official development assistance (ODA), foreign direct investment (FDI), and remittances. For older persons, this translates into increased funding for social protection programs, accessible healthcare services, and age-friendly infrastructure. However, the reality is that many developing countries struggle to allocate sufficient resources to address the needs of their aging populations, often prioritizing other pressing development issues.

Helpage International recognizes the need for innovative financing mechanisms that can supplement traditional sources of funding. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) hold significant potential in this regard, leveraging the expertise and resources of the private sector to develop sustainable solutions for older persons. For example, PPPs could facilitate the construction of affordable and accessible housing, or the development of assistive technologies that enhance the independence and quality of life of older individuals.

Furthermore, the global partnership for sustainable development must prioritize capacity-building and knowledge-sharing initiatives. Developing countries often lack the technical expertise and institutional frameworks necessary to effectively address the challenges posed by an aging population. By strengthening international cooperation and facilitating the transfer of knowledge and best practices, we can empower these countries to design and implement policies and programs that cater to the specific needs of older persons.

One particularly promising avenue is South-South cooperation, where developing countries can exchange experiences, lessons learned, and innovative solutions tailored to their respective contexts. This approach recognizes the diversity of aging experiences across different regions and cultures, and fosters a sense of ownership and empowerment among participating countries.

It is also crucial to recognize the intersectionality of issues affecting older persons, particularly in the context of developing countries. Poverty, gender inequality, and lack of access to education and healthcare services can exacerbate the vulnerabilities faced by older individuals, especially those living in rural or marginalized communities. By mainstreaming these intersectional considerations into global partnerships and development initiatives, we can ensure that no one is left behind, regardless of their age, gender, or socioeconomic status.

Moreover, the global partnership for sustainable development must prioritize the active participation and engagement of older persons themselves. Too often, policies and programs intended to benefit older individuals are designed and implemented without their meaningful involvement. By fostering inclusive and participatory processes, we can ensure that the voices and perspectives of older persons are heard and reflected in the solutions we develop.

In conclusion, achieving SDG 17 and revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable development is crucial for addressing the challenges posed by an aging population, particularly in developing countries. Helpage International calls for a concerted effort from all stakeholders, leveraging innovative financing mechanisms, strengthening international cooperation and knowledge-sharing, promoting South-South collaboration, mainstreaming intersectional considerations, and ensuring the active participation of older persons themselves. Only through a comprehensive and inclusive approach can we truly leave no one behind and create a world where older persons can age with dignity, security, and fulfillment.
