Lights Out on Energy Poverty? UN Sustainability Push Aims to Bring Power to the People

For many New Yorkers, flicking a switch and having the lights come on is something we take for granted. But for hundreds of millions around the world, access to reliable, affordable electricity remains an elusive dream. That could change with an ambitious UN initiative to make sustainable energy accessible to all by 2030.

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 7 reads like a daunting to-do list: ensure universal access to modern energy services, increase the global share of renewable energy, and dramatically improve energy efficiency. In other words, bring power to the powerless while cleaning up the dirty energy habits of the modern world.

"Energy is the golden thread that connects economic growth, social equity, and environmental sustainability," said Rachel Kyte, head of Sustainable Energy for All, a UN partner program. "Without that access to affordable, reliable and sustainable energy, it's very hard for countries to grow and develop properly."

The statistics are sobering – nearly 800 million people worldwide lack electricity entirely, the majority in sub-Saharan Africa and developing Asia. Billions more rely on polluting, unhealthy fuels like wood, coal and animal waste to cook and heat their homes. This "energy poverty" inflicts serious harm on human health through indoor air pollution while inhibiting economic progress and access to education.

But SDG 7 doesn't just envision bringing electrical grids and power plants to disconnected communities. The goal emphasizes renewable sources like solar, wind and hydropower over emissions-spewing fossil fuels. In other words, giving the world's poor access to electricity without poisoning the planet in the process.

"It's like the worst of both worlds for people living in energy poverty," said Dan Reicher, a Stanford University researcher focused on energy policy and finance. "Their current energy sources are dirty and hazardous to health, and lack of affordable power hampers any economic and human development."

Accomplishing the "sustainable energy for all" goal will require seismic public and private investments, innovative financing models, and global cooperation on a grand scale. Clean energy technology costs continue dropping, but infrastructure spending needs could hit $1 trillion annually through 2030. That's a tall order in a post-COVID economy still finding its financial footing.

"The biggest challenge is coordinating international political will and then actually stumping up the cash to finance all these renewable energy projects in developing countries," said Morgan Bazilian, director of the Payne Institute at the Colorado School of Mines. "Everyone agrees it's a great idea in theory, but making it a reality through investments will be crucial."

Some energy experts argue fossil fuels will need to play a transitional role in electrifying poor regions first, before renewable options can take over fully. That approach, detractors warn, will only worsen the carbon crisis driving climate change.

"It's not an either-or situation – we need an all-of-the-above approach for the near-term using some fossil fuel sources, but with an absolute commitment to quickly transition to cleaner energy solutions like solar, wind and geothermal," said Jim Gossart, executive director of the New Energy Nexus international clean energy organization.

If achieved, SDG 7's impact could be transformational for global economic development, human health outcomes, gender equity and environmental sustainability. In addition to saving millions of lives through reduced indoor pollution, energy access allows businesses and schools to run electronics, powered machinery, computers and lights. Renewables would help tackle climate change while reducing dependence on foreign energy imports.

"Energy access is a human right that enables children to study after sunset, women to walk home at night in safety, and countries to increase productivity and income per capita," said Riccardo Puliti, World Bank Global Director for Energy and Extractive Industries. "If you want to pull people out of the poverty cycle, you need that energy foundation first."

For decades, the world's energy-impoverished had been left behind by governments and corporations singularly pursuing growth and profits. But the new UN sustainable development agenda aims to finally turn life-changing electricity into a basic utility for all – flicking the switch to a more equitable, eco-friendly world power paradigm.
