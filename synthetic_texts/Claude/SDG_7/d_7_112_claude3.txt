Ensuring access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services is a monumental challenge that underpins sustainable development across all sectors. As the Director of the United Nations Regional Hub for Sustainable Development in Samoa, I have witnessed firsthand the profound impact of energy poverty on vulnerable communities in the Pacific region. The nexus between energy, climate change, and economic development is intrinsic, and addressing SDG 7 – Affordable and Clean Energy – is pivotal in our collective pursuit of a more equitable and resilient world.

The Pacific Island nations face unique challenges in their energy transition due to their geographic remoteness, dispersed populations, and high dependency on imported fossil fuels. Climate change exacerbates these vulnerabilities, with sea-level rise and extreme weather events threatening energy infrastructure and disrupting supply chains. Recognizing these complexities, our approach at the Regional Hub has been grounded in collaborative partnerships, capacity building, and tailored solutions that respect the cultural nuances and local contexts of each island nation.

One of our flagship initiatives is the Pacific Resilience Facility, a multi-stakeholder platform that facilitates access to climate finance and technical assistance for energy projects in the region. By leveraging blended financing mechanisms and mobilizing private sector engagement, we have catalyzed investments in renewable energy technologies, such as solar, wind, and hydropower. These projects not only contribute to emissions reduction targets but also enhance energy security, reduce reliance on imported fuel, and generate sustainable livelihoods for local communities.

Effective energy planning is paramount, and our Hub has supported several Pacific Island nations in developing Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and Integrated Resource Plans (IRPs) that prioritize renewable energy deployment and energy efficiency measures. These plans serve as roadmaps for a just and inclusive energy transition, ensuring that no one is left behind.

However, technological solutions alone are insufficient. We must address the socio-economic barriers that impede access to modern energy services, particularly for marginalized populations and remote communities. Through our capacity-building programs, we have empowered local stakeholders with the knowledge and skills necessary to maintain and operate renewable energy systems, fostering a sense of ownership and sustainability.

Furthermore, our Hub recognizes the inextricable link between energy and gender equality. Women and girls are disproportionately affected by energy poverty, often bearing the burden of arduous and time-consuming tasks such as collecting firewood or performing manual labor in the absence of modern energy services. We have championed gender-responsive policies and initiatives that promote women's leadership in the energy sector, ensuring their voices are heard and their unique perspectives are integrated into decision-making processes.

Looking ahead, our vision is to catalyze a transformative shift towards a more resilient and sustainable energy future for the Pacific region. This requires a multifaceted approach that transcends technological solutions and encompasses institutional reforms, policy coherence, and a holistic understanding of the energy-development nexus.

Collaboration and knowledge-sharing are paramount, and our Hub serves as a critical node in facilitating regional cooperation and fostering South-South exchange of best practices. By leveraging the collective wisdom and experiences of Pacific Island nations, we can accelerate progress towards SDG 7 while simultaneously addressing interlinked goals such as climate action, poverty eradication, and gender equality.

Achieving universal access to affordable and clean energy is not merely a developmental imperative; it is a moral obligation and a fundamental human right. As we navigate the complexities of the energy transition, we must remain steadfast in our commitment to leaving no one behind, ensuring that the benefits of modern energy services are equitably distributed and accessible to all.
