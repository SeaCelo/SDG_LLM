Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), written from the perspective of Ben Shapiro:

The Sustainable Development Goals have been widely promoted by the United Nations as a "blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all." However, many of these goals are fundamentally misguided, resting on flawed premises and an overly optimistic vision of top-down, centralized planning. Few goals exemplify this misplaced utopianism more than SDG 7 - ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030.

At its core, the language of this goal embraces the anti-scientific attitude of the modern environmental left. The call for "sustainable" energy is really a cipher for rejecting affordable, high-density fuel sources like natural gas, clean coal, nuclear power, and even hydroelectric in favor of intermittent, low-density sources like wind and solar. A sober analysis shows that these "renewable" sources are inherently incapable of providing the energy reliability and scalability that growing economies desperately require.

This dogged commitment to low-output "green" energy stems from the quasi-religious fear of climate change that pervades the UN and its Sustainable Development crusade. The apocalyptic predictions of anthropogenic global warming have been drastically overstated, failing to account for natural variability, solar cycles, or the ability of market forces to drive energy innovation. Emissions from developing nations are already declining through market forces as cleaner natural gas outcompetes dirtier legacy sources. But the SDGs ignore or suppress these positive trends in favor of centralized economic planning and corporate cronyism for favored "green" technologies.

The hubris of SDG 7 and its utopian vision will actively stifle progress in the developing world. Energy poverty remains a massive barrier for billions lacking access to reliable electricity and the quality of life benefits it enables. Pushing these nations to leapfrog affordable fossil fuel development and attempt to convert directly to solar/wind grids will not only dramatically increase costs but lock them into energy insecurity. Power grids cannot function with intermittent sources alone - they require stable baseline power provided by coal, gas, nuclear or hydro.

Moreover, framing this goal as "affordable" is absurd on its face. Renewable technologies remain dramatically more expensive on every objective metric whether evaluated for deployment costs, lifecycle costs or efficiency per unit of output. These high costs inevitably get passed to consumers, depressing economic growth and falling hardest on the poor who can least afford skyrocketing utility bills.  Lower income families shouldn't be forced to tighten their belts and take fewer vacations so wealthy urbanites can virtue signal about their miniscule carbon footprint.

Rather than rubber-stamping this fundamentally flawed SDG, concerned nations should demand accountability from the UN and a long overdue course correction. Global energy development should be guided by rational economic principles and consumer choice, not bureaucratic diktats disconnected from on-the-ground realities. Affordable and reliable energy access, without which no sustainable development can occur, is best achieved through deregulation, free markets, and embracing the decisive cost/output advantages of hydrocarbon fuels and next-generation nuclear technologies during this necessary transition period.

SDG 7 represents an overly ambitious attempt by unaccountable elites to short-circuit this process and bend the worldwide energy economy to their eco-utopian ideological preferences. True sustainability is achieved not through draconian intergovernmental mandates, but by trusting price signals and individual choice to drive long-term outcomes. The principles of limited government, economic freedom and decentralized markets offer the only realistic path to empowering developing nations while gradually adopting more advanced clean energy sources. The UN would be wise to abandon this centralized energy planning goal before it hamstrings global progress.
