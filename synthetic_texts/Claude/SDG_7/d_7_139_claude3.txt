Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), written from the perspective of British commentator Polly Toynbee:

Ensuring Access to Affordable and Clean Energy: The Moral Imperative of Our Time

By Polly Toynbee

Energy lies at the heart of human progress and development. It powers our homes, hospitals, schools, and industries. Yet billions globally still lack reliable access to modern energy services. This moral stain on our collective conscience simply cannot persist if we hope to build a just, sustainable world.  

The global energy landscape remains warped by staggering inequality. While the affluent burnthrough copious quantities of energy, nearly 800 million people languish in darkness, relegated to using hazardous fuels like firewood, dung, and kerosene for cooking and heating. This "energy apartheid" condemns the world's poor to a vicious cycle of impoverishment, ill health, and dimmed prospects. Household air pollution from dirty cooking fuels is one of the leading environmental causes of premature death, with women and children bearing the brunt. Energy poverty also impedes education, as children cannot study properly at night. And energy-starved economies suffocate, unable to power factories, refrigerate foods and medicines, or build climate-resilient infrastructure.

Yet this is not an insoluble crisis, but a moral failure we choose to perpetuate. Thanks to stunning technological advances, we possess the tools to course-correct. Decentralised renewable energy solutions like solar home systems, solar lamps, biogas digesters, and micro-grids are slashing energy poverty while protecting the climate. From Kenya to Bangladesh, social enterprises are deploying clean, affordable, off-grid solutions at scale. Mobile payment platforms unlock access by allowing households to "rent" energy access via pay-as-you-go models. Innovative financing structures like renewable energy auctions and green bonds mobilise private capital at mind-boggling velocity. But what's lacking is the political courage to dismantle the fossilised energy systems that entrench scarcity amidst abundance.

For the global energy system feeds the rich at the expense of the poor. An orgy of lavish subsidies keeps propping up polluting fossil fuels that ravage the climate while most of humanity chokes on clouds of black carbon. Oil giants gorge on tax giveaways while entire villages in the global South go dark. It's an unconscionable perversion of moral priorities. What we need is a profound reset to break this vicious cycle and democratise energy access.

Progressive policymaking can steer the transition and scale the delivery of clean, affordable energy to all. Subsidy swaps can redirect the $500+ billion squandered annually on fossil fuel handouts into catalysing decentralised renewable energy deployment. A global feed-in tariff program, using redirected fossil fuel subsidy flows, can ensure every household can sell their clean electricity back to the grid at a price that protects energy affordability. Public investments in last-mile grid connections can progressively realise universal electrification. Binding energy conservation roadmaps can cap excess energy glutting in the global North.   

No crisis better captures the twin challenges of sustainability and equity than energy poverty. As climate upheaval renders business-as-usual unviable, a radical reinvention of global energy systems is an existential necessity. Democratising affordable clean energy access, powered by decentralised renewable solutions, is the only dignified way forward. It's the moral test that will define our civilization: whether we muster the conscience to lift energy's cruelest burden from humanity's shouldersand build a genuinely just world of sustainable abundance for all.
