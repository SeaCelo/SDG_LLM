At the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID), we have carefully analyzed the current status of Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7), focused on ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. Despite significant progress in some regions, major challenges persist that threaten to hinder progress toward achieving this crucial objective.

Firstly, it is alarming that 789 million people still lack access to electricity, primarily in rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. This energy gap perpetuates the cycle of poverty and limits the economic and social development of these communities. Additionally, nearly 3 billion people continue to rely on polluting and hazardous fuels, such as wood, charcoal, and kerosene, to meet their basic energy needs. This situation poses serious health risks, especially for women and children, and contributes to deforestation and climate change.

Despite these challenges, promising progress has been observed in the transition toward renewable energy sources. In 2019, renewables accounted for 17.1% of global energy consumption, a significant increase compared to previous years. However, this progress has been uneven, with some countries leading the way while others lag behind. It is crucial to address this disparity and ensure that all countries have access to affordable renewable technologies tailored to their specific contexts.

Another key aspect is energy efficiency, which plays a vital role in reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Unfortunately, many countries lack robust policies and regulations in this area, hindering the adoption of efficient practices and technologies. Strengthening regulatory frameworks and promoting the transfer of knowledge and technologies is essential to advance energy efficiency across all sectors.

Additionally, it is crucial to address the financial and investment challenges that hinder progress toward SDG 7. Recent estimates indicate that annual investments of approximately $1.2 trillion will be needed until 2030 to achieve this goal. However, current financing is insufficient, particularly in developing countries with limited resources. Mobilizing additional resources, both public and private, and fostering an enabling environment for sustainable energy investment is imperative.

In this context, international cooperation and multisectoral partnerships play a fundamental role. AECID has worked closely with international partners, non-governmental organizations, the private sector, and local communities to promote sustainable and accessible energy solutions. These efforts include developing small-scale renewable energy projects, transferring clean technologies, and providing training in energy efficiency practices.

However, despite these efforts, it is clear that more ambitious and coordinated action is needed to achieve SDG 7 by 2030. Countries must adopt comprehensive energy policies and strategies that address the multidimensional challenges of accessibility, affordability, sustainability, and energy security. These strategies must be supported by substantial investments, robust regulatory frameworks, and active participation from all relevant stakeholders.

At AECID, we will continue to play an active role in promoting SDG 7 through our bilateral and multilateral cooperation. We will continue to support partner countries in capacity-building, technology transfer, and implementing innovative projects in the energy sector. Furthermore, we will collaborate closely with other development agencies, international organizations, and the private sector to leverage collective resources and knowledge for the benefit of the most vulnerable communities.

In summary, achieving SDG 7 is imperative for sustainable development and poverty eradication. While progress has been made, persistent challenges related to energy access, the transition to renewables, energy efficiency, and financing require a global and coordinated response. At AECID, we will continue to take a leadership role in this collective effort, working tirelessly to ensure that no one is left behind in the transition to a sustainable and equitable energy future.
