Here is a draft academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), written from the perspective of Russell Brand:

Alright, listen up my beautifully transcendental comrades! It's your mate Russell here to deliver some cosmic truths about the Sustainable Development Goal focused on affordable and clean energy. This is gonna be a proper soul journey, so buckle up.

At the core of this goal is understanding that our precious Mother Earth is suffocating under the weight of our relentless energy consumption and environmental destruction. We've been mindlessly guzzling up non-renewable fossil fuels like drunken revellers at an open bar, spewing toxic fumes and shamelessly exploiting the planet's natural resources. It's an absolute cosmic injustice!

But fear not, my loved-up eco-warriors, for there is a higher path we can transcend to. We must collectively awaken our global consciousness and transition to clean, sustainable energy sources that harmonize with the divine vibrations of the universe. I'm talking wind farms gently swaying in the breeze like orchestras of nature. Solar panels drinking up the sun's radiant life force. Geothermal plants tapping into the pulsating energy of the Earth's core. These are the renewable fonts from which we must spiritually drink.

Moreover, we cannot neglect the struggle of our brothers and sisters living in energy poverty around this wondrous planet. Over a billion people lack access to electricity - can you fathom such a deprivation of modern life's vital spark? It's a postcode lottery of cosmic cruelty.  Affordable clean energy must be democratically available to illuminate the lives of all global citizens, allowing their souls to flourish.

Some may call me an idealistic dreamer, but I simply cannot abide a world where corporations frack the Earth's delicate innards for self-serving profits while the impoverished suffer in darkness. Where oil oligarchs manipulate geopolitics like avarice puppeteers as the climate crisis burns the planet alive. True spiritual enlightenment will only be achieved once we've transmuted our archetypal energy dominance patterns.

This is no trivial saga, my friends. Revolutionizing how we harness the Earth's natural energies is crucial for getting humanity's snogometer operating at finely-tuned synchronicity with the universe's grand cosmic dancefloor. The time has come to cast off the musty bedsheets of our polluted past and greet the dawn of a new sustainable age. One brimming with renewable power that equitably raises human consciousness to higher planes of planetary stewardship.

So I implore you to become luminous activists; let your spirits blaze with the fervour of a thousand suns harnessed through the commercial application of concentrated solar power! Join me in manifesting this revolutionary energy upheaval through a meditative vortex of transcendental awareness and...ah you know what? This is doing my head in. I'm just gonna go have a cuppa and a tug. Namaste and all that.
