Here is a draft newspaper article about Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) as if written for The Washington Post:

The Quest for Sustainable Power: Affordable and Clean Energy for All

By Alex Mooney, Environment Correspondent

From powering the lights in our homes to fueling factories and transportation, energy is the lifeblood of modern society. But our reliance on fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas has come at a tremendous cost to the environment and human health. Burning these finite resources spews greenhouse gas emissions that drive climate change, while also releasing harmful air pollutants. As the devastating impacts of global warming intensify and concerns about air quality persist, there is an urgent need to transform how we produce and consume energy worldwide.

This challenge is at the core of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) - to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030. Achieving this goal is existential; without a rapid transition to clean energy sources like solar, wind and next-generation nuclear power, we will fail to curb climate change and its catastrophic effects. At the same time, there is a moral imperative to providing the 789 million people currently living without electricity access to reliable and affordable energy that does not degrade the environment or endanger health.

"Energy is the golden thread that weaves through the sustainable development agenda," said Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency. "We will not be able to hold the line on climate change, reduce air pollution or make modern jobs and economic prosperity a reality unless we can ensure affordable and clean energy for all."

The progress so far on SDG 7 has been a study in contrasts. While renewable energy like solar and wind has experienced stunning growth - with solar panel prices plummeting 89% over the past decade - fossil fuels still accounted for 84% of global energy consumption in 2019. This over-reliance on polluting energy sources shows how much work still lies ahead, especially in developing countries that remain disproportionately dependent on coal and biomass fuels with severe environmental and health costs.

Public and private investment in clean energy technologies, energy efficiency measures, and upgraded transmission infrastructure will be critical. Robust policy frameworks that phase out fossil fuel subsidies and ramp up carbon pricing are also essential to making renewables cost-competitive with polluting energy sources. Innovative solutions like battery storage systems and small-scale renewable energy projects tailored for rural or remote areas could also go a long way in providing modern energy access to underserved populations.

"The solutions are there, from utility-scale renewables, to decentralized microgrids and roof-top solar systems," said Rachel Kyte, the UN Secretary-General's special representative for Sustainable Energy for All. "What is missing is often the bravery and urgency from political leaders to make clean energy the affordable and sustainable choice."

In our nation's capital and across the country, families, advocates and climate experts are closely following what the Biden administration will do to advance SDG 7. After rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement, the White House aims to decarbonize the power sector by 2035 and reach net-zero emissions by 2050. This will require retiring coal plants, halting future fossil fuel extraction on public lands, and incentivizing rapid deployment of renewables alongside nuclear energy, carbon capture and green hydrogen. The recently passed bipartisan infrastructure bill is a down payment, with $73 billion allocated for upgrading the outdated electrical grid and bolstering climate resilience.

But much more ambitious action and financial investment will be required in the coming years, both in the United States and globally. The costs of inaction are too grave - from the disruptions and economic damage of climate change, to the health burdens of air pollution that already kill an estimated 7 million people annually. Achieving SDG7 is not only about mitigating environmental crises, but ensuring energy justice and eradicating the pernicious poverty and inequality that lack of electricity access perpetuates.

The stakes could not be higher. By harnessing American innovation and ingenuity to lead a global clean energy transition, we can power economies, protect the planet and uplift human welfare worldwide. No nation can afford to be left behind in the urgent quest for affordable and sustainable power for all.
