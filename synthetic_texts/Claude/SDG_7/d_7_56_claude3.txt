Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) from the perspective of Brendan O'Neill:

The Unsustainable Delusion of "Sustainable" Energy 

By Brendan O'Neill, Polemicist and Spiked Editor

The obsession with pursuing "sustainable" energy represents a dangerous obsession with backwardness and environmental authoritarianism. The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 7 - to "ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all" - might sound benign, even laudable. But behind the vague language lies an anti-human misanthropy that celebrates sustainability over human flourishing and seeks to codify energy poverty for the world's masses.

At its core, SDG 7 is driven by an irrational fear of fossil fuels and the mistaken belief that carbon emissions are an existential threat to the planet. These intellectually shabby ideas emerged from the apocalyptic "limits to growth" thinking of the 1970s which posited that unchecked industrial development would rapidly deplete the world's resources. But this neo-Malthusian ideology has been comprehensively debunked by data showing increasing abundance of accessible energy reserves and stable commodity prices over recent decades.  

And yet, the supranational technocrats at the UN and the environmentalist movement have doubled down on these ideas, re-branding them as"sustainable development" tomaintain the environmentalist agenda's relevance and self-appointed authority. Sustainability has become the highest value, superseding even human welfare itself.

One only need look at the impacts when these anti-progress ideas are implemented in policy. SDG 7 demands a radical upending of the world's energy systems, rapidly transitioning from abundant and affordable fossil fuels towards the forced adoption of inefficient, unreliable renewable sources like wind and solar. Such a transition is estimated to cost over $100 trillion globally. These exorbitant costs will inevitably be passed on to industry and energy consumers, making basic energy services prohibitively expensive for much of humanity.

The results speak for themselves. In Germany, heavy-handed sustainable energy policies have caused household electricity prices to nearly triple over the past two decades. EU renewable policies are directly culpable for pushing nearly 60 million Europeans into energy poverty, forcing families to choose between heating or eating. California's renewable mandates have destabilized the grid, causing widespread blackouts and some of the highest energy costs in America.

And for what gain? The self-inflicted economic damage incurred by sustainable energy policies is all in service of the utopian fantasy of stabilizing a planetary climate that has always been in constant flux. Even if every nation somehow hit the Paris climate accord's emissions reduction targets, it would result in less than 0.2°C of avoided warming by 2100. At the cost of trillions redirected from real environmental and humanitarian priorities.

This is the suicidal bargain at the heart of SDG 7's agenda – doubling global energy costs for virtually no measurable climate impact while consigning billions to stagnant energy squalor. And in the end, it won't even achieve"sustainability." Unreliable, resource-intense renewables are utterly unsustainable on any meaningful scale, requiring perpetual flows of rare earth minerals and materials from mining, an endless cycle of construction and replacement, and backup from conventional sources when the sun doesn't shine or wind doesn't blow.

The true path to human sustainability and flourishing is through amplifying our mastery of energy rather than enforced energy privation.We need more cheap, potent, scalable and reliable energy sources, not less. The vilification of fossil fuels and obstructionism against nuclear and other breakthrough technologies only serves to hobble human potential and progress. Rather than acceding to arbitrary "sustainable" targets, our priority must be liberating energy development to lift all of humanity to modernity.

SDG 7 is not about sustainable energy, but cementing a regressive, anti-human agenda based on hair-shirt environmentalism. We would be wise to relegate this unsustainable delusion to the waste bin of history. Our future depends on it.
