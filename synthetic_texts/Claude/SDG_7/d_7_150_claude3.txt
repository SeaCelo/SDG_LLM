Here is a draft academic article about SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), written from the perspective of Mona Charen, a renowned conservative political analyst, author, and public speaker:

The transition to clean and sustainable energy sources is one of the paramount challenges facing humanity in the 21st century. As a matter of prudence and pragmatism, we must confront the existential threat posed by climate change head-on. Yet the solutions proposed by many on the left often rely on heavy-handed government intervention, sky-high taxation, and damaging restrictions on free markets and individual liberty. A more judicious approach is required.

The 7th Sustainable Development Goal calls for "ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all." This is a laudable and necessary aim. Fossil fuels have powered the incredible economic growth and technological advancement that have uplifted billions from abject poverty over the past two centuries. However, their proliferation has come at an immense environmental cost that can no longer be ignored or externalized.

The imperative now is to harness the power of market forces, technological innovation, and economic incentives to accelerate the transition to cleaner energy sources at a globally competitiveness scale and cost. Government certainly has a role, but it should be oriented around enabling and unleashing the dynamism of the private sector rather than hamstringing it.

Tax policies, for instance, should eliminate unjustifiable subsidies for mature fossil fuel industries and redirect them toward incentivizing research, development, and deployment of next-generation clean technologies like advanced nuclear reactors, grid-scale battery storage, green hydrogen, and carbon capture methods. Streamlining regulatory barriers that obstruct large-scale renewable deployments and opening access to domestic energy reserves on federal lands can also accelerate progress.

At the same time, it is misguided to put all our chips on sources like wind and solar that still suffer from intermittency issues. For energy abundance, reliability, and security, the solution basket must also include advanced nuclear designs that produce zero emissions and can provide stable baseload power complementing renewables.  

Critically, market competition and economic freedom must be central drivers for clean energy advancement. State-centric outlooks that seek to have bureaucrats and politicians attempt to plan and regulate our way toward achieving SDG 7 are doomed to fail through rent-seeking, cronyism, and institutional ossification. Only decentralized, innovative private actors propelled by the profit motive can deliver clean energy solutions at the pace and scale needed.

Consider how competitive shale drilling and fracking over the past decade rapidly upended global energy markets and reduced emissions by allowing abundant natural gas to supplant coal-fired power. Or how upstart companies like Tesla have electrified the automotive industry and made inroads toward decarbonization that plodding incumbents could not achieve through regulatory imposition alone.

In line with American values of industriousness and indomitable spirit, economic freedom policies that protect property rights, lower tax burdens, and reduce regulatory barriers will accelerate energy transformation. The path to SDG 7 requires deft navigation, but free societies have consistently demonstrated an ability to harness the creative powers of human ingenuity to surmount formidable challenges.
