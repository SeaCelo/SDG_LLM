Here is a draft academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), written from the perspective of renowned writer Gene Weingarten:

The Quest for Energetic Enlightenment: How Affordable and Clean Energy Could Save Humanity (If We Don't Mess It Up)

My friends, we stand at a crossroads that will define the fate of our species and this fragile orb we call home. On one path lies the promise of a verdant, vibrant future powered by clean, renewable energy sources that harmonize with the natural world. The other? A smoldering, irradiated wasteland of our own making, where the air chokes with noxious fumes and the oceans swell with melted ice caps. The choice seems obvious, yet humanity's long-standing love affair with fossil fuels has blinded us to the existential threat we face.  

Let's turn our attention to Sustainable Development Goal 7, the one aimed at ensuring "access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all." It's a mouthful, I know, but behind that sesquipedalianism lies the key to our survival—and perhaps our undoing if we fail to heed its wisdom.

At its core, SDG 7 champions the expansion of renewable energy from sources like solar, wind, geothermal, and hydroelectric power. No longer can we ravage the earth's interior for coal, oil, and gas, those subterranean siren songs that have lured us down the path of environmental ruin. We must resist their temptations and embrace the boundless potential of sun, air, water, and earth's inner fire.

Some may balk at the perceived costs and logistical hurdles, but the equation is simple: Pay now through investments in clean tech, or pay later with the extinction of life as we know it. And make no mistake, those upfront expenditures will pale in comparison to the incalculable financial toll of climate catastrophe.

Of course, energy accessibility goes beyond mere resource procurement. We cannot ignore the hundreds of millions worldwide who lack reliable access to electricity—a modern necessity akin to food, water, and shelter. Bringing affordable, sustainable power to these populations is a moral imperative that transcends economic and national boundaries.  

But let's be honest: Even if every nation wholeheartedly embraced SDG 7, our work would just be beginning. Energy usage must become hyper-efficient, with minimal waste. Archaic power grids must undergo massive overhauls. Carbon-capture technologies will likely play a role in mitigating existing emissions. And perhaps most critically, we must rethink societal attitudes that treat energy as an infinite resource to be squandered.

The path will be arduous, frought with political inertia, corporate avarice, and humanity's innate resistance to transformative change. But the alternative—the path of "drill, baby, drill" until our planet lies barren and uninhabitable—is a grim reality we cannot accept.

So I put the challenge to you, my friends: Will we rise to meet SDG 7's lofty ambitions? Will we shed our stubborn befoulment of this cosmic gem called Earth? The answers, as always, lie within. It's time to surprise ourselves.
