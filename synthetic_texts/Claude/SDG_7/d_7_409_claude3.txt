Compassion International, a leading global humanitarian organization, is deeply committed to the achievement of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7), which aims to "ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all." As we navigate the complexities of the 21st century, access to clean and sustainable energy sources is not only a crucial factor in eradicating poverty and promoting economic growth but also a fundamental human right.

The world has made significant strides in expanding access to electricity, with the global electrification rate reaching 90% in 2019. However, this progress is overshadowed by the staggering 759 million people who still lack access to electricity, predominantly in rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa and developing Asia. Furthermore, an estimated 2.6 billion individuals rely on inefficient and polluting cooking fuels, such as wood, charcoal, and dung, which contribute to indoor air pollution and respiratory illnesses, disproportionately affecting women and children.

Compassion International recognizes that achieving SDG 7 is intrinsically linked to addressing multiple intersecting challenges, including climate change, environmental degradation, and public health concerns. Transitioning to renewable and sustainable energy sources is crucial for mitigating the adverse effects of climate change, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and promoting environmental conservation.

Our organization's approach to SDG 7 is multifaceted, incorporating innovative technologies, community-driven initiatives, and strategic partnerships. One of our flagship programs focuses on the deployment of off-grid solar energy solutions in remote and underserved communities. By leveraging the power of decentralized renewable energy systems, we empower households and small businesses with clean, reliable, and affordable electricity, enabling them to engage in income-generating activities, access essential services, and improve their overall quality of life.

Moreover, we have implemented comprehensive clean cooking initiatives, introducing improved cookstoves and promoting the use of alternative fuels, such as biogas and ethanol. These efforts not only reduce indoor air pollution and associated health risks but also contribute to forest conservation by reducing the demand for firewood and charcoal.

Recognizing the interconnectedness of the SDGs, our interventions are designed to intersect with other critical areas, such as education, gender equality, and economic empowerment. For instance, our solar-powered community centers serve as educational hubs, where children and adults can access learning resources and participate in vocational training programs, fostering sustainable livelihoods and breaking the cycle of poverty.

Furthermore, Compassion International actively engages with local communities, empowering them to take ownership of their energy solutions. We collaborate with grassroots organizations, community leaders, and traditional authorities to ensure that our initiatives are culturally relevant, socially acceptable, and aligned with the specific needs and aspirations of the communities we serve.

To amplify our impact, we cultivate strategic partnerships with governments, multilateral organizations, private sector entities, and research institutions. These collaborations facilitate knowledge-sharing, technology transfer, and the mobilization of resources, enabling us to scale up our interventions and drive systemic change.

As we progress towards achieving SDG 7, we remain cognizant of the challenges that lie ahead. Ensuring long-term sustainability and resilience of energy systems, particularly in the face of climate change and natural disasters, is a critical consideration. Additionally, addressing the affordability and financing barriers that prevent low-income households from accessing clean energy solutions remains a key priority.

Compassion International's commitment to SDG 7 is unwavering, as we recognize the transformative power of sustainable energy in uplifting communities, promoting inclusive economic growth, and safeguarding our planet for future generations. Through our holistic and community-centered approach, we strive to create a world where access to clean, reliable, and affordable energy is a reality for all, paving the way for a more sustainable and equitable future.
