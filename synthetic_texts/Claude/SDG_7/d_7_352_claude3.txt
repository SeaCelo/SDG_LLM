Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency's (TİKA) strategic policy framework, aligned with the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7), is a multi-faceted approach that encompasses energy access, renewable energy integration, and energy efficiency initiatives. Our comprehensive roadmap navigates the intricate landscape of ensuring affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy for all segments of society while mitigating the environmental impact of energy systems.

At the core of our endeavors is the recognition that energy poverty remains a pervasive challenge, disproportionately affecting marginalized communities and impeding socioeconomic progress. In this regard, TİKA has undertaken targeted interventions in remote and underserved regions, establishing decentralized renewable energy solutions tailored to local contexts. Our collaborations with local stakeholders have facilitated the deployment of solar photovoltaic systems, small-scale hydropower plants, and biogas digesters, thereby enhancing energy access and fostering sustainable livelihoods.

Furthermore, we have actively promoted the integration of renewable energy sources into the broader energy mix, recognizing their pivotal role in combating climate change and promoting environmental sustainability. TİKA's technical assistance and capacity-building programs have empowered partner countries to overcome regulatory, financial, and infrastructural barriers, paving the way for the large-scale adoption of wind, solar, and geothermal power generation. Our projects have encompassed the construction of utility-scale renewable energy facilities, the establishment of enabling policy frameworks, and the development of robust transmission and distribution networks.

Energy efficiency has emerged as a cornerstone of our strategy, underpinned by the recognition that curbing energy demand is equally crucial as expanding supply. TİKA has spearheaded initiatives focused on improving energy efficiency in residential, commercial, and industrial sectors through the implementation of cutting-edge technologies, energy audits, and targeted awareness campaigns. Our collaborations with the private sector have fostered the adoption of energy-efficient practices, contributing to reduced greenhouse gas emissions and enhanced competitiveness.

Recognizing the multidimensional nature of energy challenges, TİKA has embraced a holistic approach that transcends mere infrastructure development. Our efforts have encompassed capacity-building programs for policymakers, regulators, and energy professionals, fostering an enabling environment for sustainable energy transitions. We have prioritized knowledge-sharing platforms, facilitating the exchange of best practices and innovative solutions among partner countries.

Moreover, TİKA's interventions have been guided by a commitment to gender equality and social inclusion, ensuring that the benefits of sustainable energy initiatives are equitably distributed. Our projects have empowered women as agents of change, providing them with access to clean cooking solutions, entrepreneurial opportunities, and decision-making roles in energy governance.

As we navigate the complexities of the energy transition, TİKA remains steadfast in its commitment to forging strategic partnerships and leveraging the expertise of diverse stakeholders. Our collaborative efforts have engaged government entities, civil society organizations, academic institutions, and the private sector, fostering synergies and maximizing the impact of our interventions.

Looking ahead, TİKA's vision for SDG 7 extends beyond the 2030 horizon, recognizing the imperative of long-term energy sustainability. Our roadmap envisions a future where energy systems are not only clean and affordable but also resilient to the compounding challenges of climate change, resource scarcity, and geopolitical dynamics. We are committed to continuously adapting our strategies, embracing emerging technologies, and fostering innovation to ensure that our partner countries are well-equipped to navigate the evolving energy landscape.
