Title: Ensuring Access to Affordable, Reliable, Sustainable and Modern Energy for All: A Corporate Finance Perspective on SDG 7

By Michael C. Jensen

The Seventh Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 7) aims to "ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all" by 2030. As a pioneer in the field of corporate finance and a firm believer in the power of private enterprise to drive positive change, I believe that achieving this goal requires a fundamental shift in how we perceive and approach energy systems.

The conventional wisdom has long been that energy is a public good, best managed and regulated by governments. However, this top-down approach has consistently failed to deliver reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy to billions of people worldwide. It is time to recognize that the private sector, guided by the invisible hand of the market and the profit motive, is better equipped to drive the innovation and efficiency required to meet the world's energy needs.

At the core of this argument is the concept of agency costs – the inherent conflicts of interest that arise when decision-makers (agents) do not bear the full consequences of their actions. In the case of state-owned energy enterprises, bureaucrats and politicians are driven by political expediency rather than long-term value creation. They lack the incentives to invest in costly but essential infrastructure upgrades, adopt cutting-edge technologies, or prioritize customer satisfaction.

In contrast, private energy companies are beholden to their shareholders, who demand consistent returns on their investments. This alignment of interests between owners and managers creates a powerful incentive for efficiency, innovation, and customer-centricity. Moreover, the threat of bankruptcy – a market mechanism absent in the public sector – imposes strict financial discipline, forcing companies to adapt or perish.

This is not to say that the private sector is a panacea; market failures, externalities, and monopolistic tendencies must be addressed through judicious regulation. However, a well-designed regulatory framework that fosters competition, protects consumer rights, and internalizes environmental costs can harness the power of the profit motive to drive sustainable energy solutions.

One promising avenue is the widespread adoption of distributed energy resources (DERs), such as rooftop solar panels, small-scale wind turbines, and battery storage systems. By decentralizing energy production and empowering consumers to become "prosumers" (producers and consumers), DERs can disrupt the traditional utility model and create a more resilient, efficient, and democratic energy landscape.

Imagine a future where households and businesses not only meet their energy needs through on-site generation but also trade excess capacity on a virtual energy marketplace. Such a peer-to-peer network, facilitated by blockchain technology and smart contracts, could optimize energy flows in real-time, reducing waste and maximizing renewable integration.

Of course, this vision requires a supportive regulatory environment that incentivizes investment in DERs and removes barriers to market entry. It also necessitates a robust energy infrastructure capable of accommodating two-way power flows and integrating diverse energy sources.

This is where public-private partnerships (PPPs) can play a pivotal role. By leveraging the technical expertise and financial resources of the private sector, governments can accelerate the transition to sustainable energy systems while retaining oversight and ensuring equitable access.

For instance, a PPP could be structured to upgrade and maintain a nation's transmission and distribution networks, with the private partner responsible for financing, construction, and operation, and the government setting performance standards and providing targeted subsidies to ensure affordability for low-income households.

Another promising avenue is the development of innovative financing mechanisms, such as green bonds and energy service companies (ESCOs), which can unlock private capital for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects.

Ultimately, achieving SDG 7 requires a holistic approach that recognizes the complementary roles of the public and private sectors. By harnessing the power of the profit motive and leveraging the strengths of both spheres, we can create a future where affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy is not a luxury but a reality for all.
