Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 7 (Ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all) from the perspective of Andrew Bolt, a controversial Australian commentator and climate change skeptic:

The UN's Sustainable Development Goal 7 calls for universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services by 2030. On the surface, this may sound like a reasonable and even noble aspiration. However, a deeper examination reveals the insidious agenda underpinning it - the same eco-extremism that has gripped the climate change discourse and threatens to strangle economic prosperity. 

At its core, SDG 7 is a thinly veiled attempt to force a transition away from cheap, reliable fossil fuel energy that has been the bedrock of industrialization and improving living standards. The push for "sustainable" and "modern" energy sources is code for subsidizing inefficient, intermittent renewables like wind and solar at the expense of coal, oil and gas. This myopic focus threatens to make energy unaffordable for billions, condemning the developing world's poorest to perpetual energy poverty.

The SDG's ambitions for universal energy access ring hollow when you consider its champions' vehement opposition to the cheapest baseload power sources like coal. How can energy possibly be affordable and reliable for all if policymakers across the West are hellbent on decommissioning coal and nuclear plants in favor of expensive, weather-dependent renewables? Mark my words - pursuing this green utopian fantasy will only lead to skyrocketing power prices, crippling shortages, and economic ruin.

Moreover, the entire premise that we face a human-caused climate crisis is based on flawed computer models and climate alarmism pushed by grant-chasing scientists and ideological activists. Credible data shows temperatures have only risen modestly, with periods of cooling interspersed with warming phases - all part of the natural fluctuations our planet has experienced for millennia. To upend affordable, scalable energy on the basis of such shaky evidence is the height of recklessness.

Any rational discussion of SDG 7 must acknowledge the vital role fossil fuels have played in lifting billions out of abject poverty over the past century. It was abundant, inexpensive coal, oil and gas - not fickle solar panels or noisy wind farms - that ushered in the industrial revolution and catalyzed epochal gains in productivity, living standards and life expectancy across the world. Even today, over 80% of global energy supplies come from fossil fuels, the affordable bedrock allowing modern societies to function and people to go about their daily lives.

The eco-warriors pushing SDG 7 view such inconvenient facts as heresy, instead favoring an absolutist agenda that leaves no room for rational cost-benefit analysis or real-world tradeoffs. They sanctimoniously declare the "environmental crisis" is so severe that slashing emissions at any cost is the only moral choice - consequences for human flourishing be damned. But it is they who are inflicting an ethical crisis by prioritizing computer-modeled climate projections over the plight of the developing world's energy-starved billions.

For too long, the climate change debate has been monopolized by green utopians and guilt-mongering over our carbon footprints. SDG 7 represents more of the same misguided hypocrisy - well-fed Westerners arrogantly presuming to dictate energy policies that will condemn the world's poorest to squalor and destitution. If we are serious about uplifting billions through access to affordable, reliable electricity, the solution is clear: rejecting the regressive eco-agenda, doubling down on baseload fossil fuels, and pursuing an all-of-the-above energy mix that balances economic and environmental priorities. Anything else will leave SDG 7's lofty rhetoric as a cruel delusion.
