As the Azerbaijan International Development Agency, we present this analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7), which aims to "ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all." Energy is a crucial enabler for sustainable development, and achieving this goal is pivotal in addressing global challenges such as poverty, climate change, and economic growth.

Azerbaijan, a nation endowed with significant energy resources, has made notable strides in promoting sustainable energy practices. However, like many countries, we still face challenges in ensuring universal access, increasing the share of renewable energy, and improving energy efficiency.

Our nation's energy landscape is dominated by fossil fuels, particularly natural gas, which accounts for a significant portion of our energy mix. While this has contributed to economic growth and energy security, it has also exacerbated environmental concerns and greenhouse gas emissions. Recognizing the urgency of transitioning to a more sustainable energy future, Azerbaijan has taken several initiatives to diversify its energy mix and embrace renewable sources.

One of our flagship programs is the Strategic Road Map on the Development of Utility Services, which outlines a comprehensive plan for modernizing the energy sector, enhancing energy efficiency, and promoting renewable energy sources. Under this initiative, we have set ambitious targets to increase the share of renewable energy in our total energy consumption to 30% by 2030. This includes harnessing our abundant solar and wind resources through the development of large-scale solar and wind power plants, as well as small-scale distributed renewable energy systems.

To facilitate this transition, we have implemented various policy measures, including feed-in tariffs, tax incentives, and regulatory reforms, to attract private investment and foster a conducive environment for renewable energy projects. Furthermore, we have established partnerships with international organizations and development agencies to leverage their expertise and financial support in developing our renewable energy infrastructure.

Addressing energy access and affordability is another critical aspect of SDG 7. While Azerbaijan has achieved near-universal electrification, there are still remote and rural communities that lack reliable access to modern energy services. To bridge this gap, we have launched initiatives such as the "Green Village" project, which aims to provide off-grid renewable energy solutions, including solar photovoltaic systems and biogas digesters, to isolated rural areas. This not only improves energy access but also promotes sustainable agricultural practices and reduces reliance on traditional biomass fuels, mitigating indoor air pollution and deforestation.

Energy efficiency is another pivotal component of our sustainable energy strategy. We have implemented a range of measures to improve energy efficiency across various sectors, including the residential, commercial, and industrial sectors. These measures include building energy codes, appliance standards, energy audits, and incentives for energy-efficient technologies. Additionally, we have embarked on initiatives to modernize our energy infrastructure, upgrade transmission and distribution networks, and reduce energy losses.

Recognizing the cross-cutting nature of SDG 7, we have adopted a holistic approach that integrates energy initiatives with other sustainable development goals. For instance, our efforts to promote clean cooking solutions and reduce indoor air pollution contribute to improved health outcomes (SDG 3). Similarly, our initiatives to provide energy access in rural areas support economic development and job creation (SDG 8), while our investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency align with climate action (SDG 13).

However, achieving SDG 7 is not without challenges. Limited financial resources, technological barriers, and institutional capacity constraints pose significant obstacles. To address these challenges, we have fostered international cooperation and partnerships, leveraging the expertise and resources of various stakeholders, including multilateral organizations, private sector entities, and civil society organizations.

In conclusion, Azerbaijan's commitment to SDG 7 is evident through our comprehensive strategies, policy measures, and targeted initiatives. While significant progress has been made, we recognize that achieving sustainable energy for all requires sustained efforts, innovative solutions, and a collaborative approach involving all relevant stakeholders. By continuing to prioritize sustainable energy practices, we can accelerate our progress towards achieving SDG 7 and contribute to a more sustainable, prosperous, and equitable future for our nation and the world.
