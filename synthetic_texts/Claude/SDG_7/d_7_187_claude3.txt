Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), written from the perspective of renowned columnist Eugene Robinson:

The Quest for Clean, Affordable Power: A Moral and Economic Imperative

By Eugene Robinson

The pursuit of sustainable, inexpensive energy sources represents one of the great challenges — and opportunities — of our era. On one side teeters the fate of the planet itself, with unchecked emissions and rampant resource depletion pushing us toward an existential precipice. On the other side beckons a future of energy abundance, where innovative solutions allow all of humanity to thrive without mortgaging the environment or bankrupting economies. Striking this delicate balance is Sustainable Development Goal 7: ensuring universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services while doubling the global rate of energy efficiency and expanding renewable sources.

The stakes could not be higher. The insidious drum beat of climate change grows ever louder, as rising sea levels threaten coastal megacities, crop yields falter, and weather patterns careen into chaos. The Pentagon warns that climate change is a "threat multiplier" that could exacerbate poverty, social tensions, health catastrophes, and conflict. We cannot kick this can down the road any longer. Transitioning rapidly to clean energy is both an urgent survival necessity and a moral imperative.

Fortunately, the technologies to make this transition are at our fingertips — if we have the collective will to implement them. Thanks to stunning advances in batteries, wind and solar generation are increasingly cost-competitive with fossil fuels. The plummeting price of renewable energy combined with new financing models democratizes access, empowering impoverished villages to leapfrog into the energy future. McKinsey estimates that achieving SDG 7 could unlock $4.3 trillion in economic opportunities across major energy sectors.

But significant roadblocks remain. Too many industry incumbents cling to the status quo that enriches their bottom lines while poisoning the planet. Too many governments subsidize fossil fuels, erecting artificial barriers to clean energy adoption. And too many societies suffer from infrastructure deficits that obstruct development and deny families the lights, cooling, and power necessary for modern life.

This intransigence damages more than the environment. It cripples economic prospects, especially in the developing world where lack of energy access traps millions in squalid poverty. According to the International Energy Agency, over 620 million Africans lack access to electricity — a staggering abdication of human potential. When children must shuffle home before nightfall because their slums lack streetlights, how can they study to become tomorrow's engineers or entrepreneurs? When rural clinics cannot refrigerate vaccines, how many infants perish from preventable diseases? Energy poverty is a dream-killer that perpetuates deprivation across generations.

But we have an opportunity to chart a more luminous path. Innovative public-private initiatives like the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves are marrying renewable energies with novel technologies to drive development while enhancing health and protecting forests. Entire countries like Costa Rica now generate nearly all their electricity from renewable sources, shattering myths about the feasibility or affordability of clean energy. If we match this technological ingenuity with a similar boldness of vision and policy, an electrified, decarbonized future is within reach.

So I call on my colleagues in government, industry, and civil society to elevate SDG 7 as a preeminent priority. Let's move beyond empty rhetoric and make the hard choices. Establish binding global emissions targets with transparent accountability. Phase out fossil fuel subsidies in favor of incentives for renewable deployment. Invest aggressively in green infrastructure, storage solutions, and energy efficiency technologies. Democratize energy access through innovative financing and public-private partnerships. Above all, treat climate change for what it is — the paramount challenge of our time that demands a Promethean insistence on bending the arc of technological progress toward environmental salvation.

The path ahead will not be easy. It will require transcending partisan divisions, national self-interests, and the tyranny of discounting the welfare of future generations. But in confronting the existential crossroads of SDG 7, history will render a harsh judgment on any failure of moral vision and courage. Conversely, those daring leaders who pioneer this energy transformation will be lionized as champions of planetary survival, economic dynamism, and our species' boundless capacity for ingenuity and hope.
