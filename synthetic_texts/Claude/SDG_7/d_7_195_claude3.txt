Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), written from the perspective of conservative columnist Cal Thomas:

The Sustainable Development Goals laid out by the United Nations represent an ambitious, if misguided, attempt to reshape the world order through centralized planning and a subjective prioritization of environmental concerns over economic realities. While ensuring access to affordable, reliable energy is a laudable aim, SDG 7's approach is fundamentally flawed, relying on the heavy hand of government intervention and a curtailing of free market capitalism. 

At its core, this goal embodies the collectivist mindset that has impoverished nations and undermined prosperity time and again throughout history. By directing countries to "increase substantially the share of renewable energy" through top-down diktats, it discourages innovation and displaces the governing dynamics of supply and demand that have catalyzed human progress. Renewable sources cannot meet global energy needs at an acceptable cost; to contort the market through subsidies and regulations serves only to divert resources from more viable solutions.

The pursuit of "clean" energy is a misnomer driven by environmental alarmism, not rational cost-benefit analysis. If the conventional sources spurned by SDG 7 were as cataclysmic as its proponents claim, why have living standards dramatically improved alongside their proliferation? Air quality in U.S. cities vastly improved over the past decades even as fossil fuel use grew. The modern environmental renaissance of dense reforestation stems from the efficiency and scalability enabled by hydrocarbon energy. Counterintuitively, implementing this goal could divert resources from the innovation and growth that lifts nations from poverty - the precondition for environmental preservation.

Moreover, SDG 7's very conception betrays Western ethical conceits. The estimated 1 billion lacking electricity access predominantly occupy developing countries where economic development is the preeminent priority; denying these populations viable energy sources subjugates their aspirational rights to the virtuous preening of affluent nations. The push for intermittent and diffuse renewable sources is infeasible in regions without robust grid infrastructure; centralized electrification projects relying on traditional sources are the pragmatic solution, however ideologically unpalatable to environmentalists. 

Rather than unaccountable bureaucrats atUN headquarters arrogating control over national energy policies, decisions over resource allocations are best left to sovereign nations, stakeholders, and the creative dynamism of the private sector. Time and again, centralized initiatives like SDG 7 produce unintended consequences more destructive than the purported ills they aim to solve. Economic growth, driven by market incentives, remains the proven catalyst for empowering human flourishing, environmental stewardship, and sustainable energy development. This goal represents an imposition of the social engineers' ideological blinders, not a viable framework for addressing the world's energy needs.
