Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), written from the perspective of renowned Indian satirist and author Jug Suraiya:

The Satire of Sustainable Development Goal 7 - A Comical Take on Affordable and Clean Energy by Jug Suraiya

Ah, the Sustainable Development Goals - a grandiose plan hatched by squads of starry-eyed bureaucrats to save the world through a series of lofty, metaphysical incantations. As if scribbling some aspirational phrases on a bit of paper will magically solve millennia of human folly. Nevertheless, I am contractually obliged to take on the Herculean task of unraveling the ironic comedy buried within these maxims. Today's target: SDG 7 - "Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all."  

One can't help but chuckle at the sheer ambition behind this goal. Providing cheap, clean energy for every human being? Why, it's akin to distributing sense and prudence to every politician and televangelist! A more fitting sustainable goal may be to accept our species' seemingly innate impulse towards self-destruction and environmental pillaging.

But I digress. The inherent farce lies in the paradoxical trifecta of "affordable, reliable, sustainable." It's a magical triple-constraint that makes a mythical sphinx's riddle look like child's play. Affordable for whom, one may ask? The fossil fuel oligarchs guffawing from their ninth vacation home? Or the billions condemned to endless energy poverty? 

Then there's the delightful oxymoron of "sustainable" and "modern" cohabitating in sacred unity. How contemporary must this energy be to be anointed "modern?" Advanced enough to dim the stars with our artificial radiance? And at what point does innovation cease to be sustainable - when we're burning dragonscale for fuel?

The path to achieving this quixotic vision is paved with just as many comedic gems. We're instructed to "increase substantially the share of renewable energy" while investing in "energy infrastructure and clean energy technology." Because obviously, the panacea is to keep building more energy factories and grids, but with a garnish of 'green-ness' sprinkled atop. 

Arguably the most side-splitting prescription is "expanding infrastructure and upgrading technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services." Surely the solution is more infrastructure, more technology! Let's crochet an impregnable hairball of wires, pipes, and machinery to ensnare every corner of the world. Onward to a glorious clean energy singularity!

Then there are the intriguing "international cooperation" obligations to facilitate clean energy research and investment in the impoverished regions. One can virtually hear the lucrative consultancy proposals being feverishly penned - bountiful opportunities to helicopter in packs of skinny-jeaned upstart saviors peddling locally-unviable energy solutions!

At the end of this mirthful journey through SDG 7's quixotic contortions, one is left to ponder the exquisite tragic-comedy that is our civilization's quest for abundant, ultra-modern energy Valhalla. Will we rise as sustainable visionaries, or succumb to farce as a species of cosmic jesters? Only the cruelest of cosmic playwrights knows the final punchline. But one thing is certain - the road to affordable, reliable, modern energy for all will be paved with plenty of comedic absurdities to be satirized.
