Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) as if written by the renowned Indian economist and commentator Swaminathan Aiyar:

At the heart of sustainable development lie the intricately linked challenges of energy access, energy affordability, and environmental sustainability. Sustainable Development Goal 7, which calls for ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030, is both an immense opportunity and a formidable test for nations across the development spectrum. 

India's own pursuit of SDG 7 epitomizes the complexities and contradictions that many developing countries face. Our subcontinent's massive population of 1.3 billion is plagued by debilitating energy poverty - nearly a quarter remain off the power grid, and millions more endure intermittent, low-quality electricity access. Yet at the same time, India is the world's third largest emitter of greenhouse gases, with rapidly rising energy demands clashing against the existential threat of climate change. We cannot remain trapped in this zero-sum conundrum.

Breaking this deadlock requires disrupting traditional models with transformative solutions harnessing technology, economics and innovation. We must embrace decentralized renewable energy as a low-carbon leapfrog, rapidly scaling up off-grid solar power for energy-poor rural areas. After pioneering the world's largest renewable energy expansion program, India is well-positioned to massively ramp up solar home systems, solar mini-grids and increasingly affordable grid-connected solar. Facilitating access to innovative finance and promoting localized entrepreneurship models can be game-changing here.

In our cities, a very different challenge persists - households connected to grids are overcharged for patchy electricity plagued by frequent outages, even as cash-strapped distribution utilities reel under staggering losses. Smart metering, privatized distribution franchises, and reduced cross-subsidies can inject vital market discipline. With an increasingly urbanizing population, promoting green buildings, energy-efficient lighting and appliances via innovative regulatory mechanisms is crucial. Steadily taxing coal while leveraging market-based emission trading systems can steer us towards a decarbonized energy future.

Realizing SDG 7's transformative vision stretches far beyond power sector reforms. We must press for a holistic overhaul of India's overall energy ecosystem - rapidly scaling up electric mobility, hydrogen, biofuels and grid modernization. Public-private investments into cutting-edge R&D for cleaner fossil fuels, carbon capture and next-generation renewables like offshore wind and geothermal must be turbocharged. 

Above all, SDG 7 necessitates abandoning entrenched policy silos and vested interests in favor of an integrated, 'whole-of-government' approach. This means ferociously pruning a jungle of subsidized prices distorting energy markets. It means rationalized electricity tariffs reflecting true costs and minimizing regressive cross-subsidization favouring richer households. It means catalyzing freer domestic and international energy markets insulated from populist political pressures. It means empowering regulators and steadfastly implementing contractual payment discipline to restore investor confidence. 

Without such systemic reforms, India's energy transition will falter. Merely erecting more renewable plants without catalyzing genuine economic reforms is akin to trying to retrofit a combustion engine onto an electric vehicle chassis. Our choice is simple - remain mired in energy poverty and environmental degradation, or decisively unleash the catalytic disruptions powering the world's next great economic revolution, with SDG 7 as the launchpad.
