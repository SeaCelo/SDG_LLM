Here's a long academic article about SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) written in the humorous, satirical style of Dave Barry:

Affordable and Clean Energy? More Like Expensive and Dirty if You Ask Me

Listen up, folks, because we're about to tackle one of the most crucial issues facing humanity today: Affordable and Clean Energy. Or as I like to call it, the "Good Luck With That" Goal. Seriously, have you seen the price of gas lately? It's like they're drilling for dinosaur bones and selling them by the gallon.

But let's not get ahead of ourselves. First, we need to understand what this whole "Affordable and Clean Energy" thing is all about. Apparently, some well-meaning folks at the United Nations decided that the world needed a set of goals to make our planet a better place. You know, like losing weight or finally cleaning out the garage, but on a global scale.

Now, I'm all for saving the world and whatnot, but when I see words like "affordable" and "clean" used in the same sentence as "energy," my skepticism radar goes into overdrive. It's like saying "delicious" and "diet" in the same breath. Sure, they sound great together, but we all know the reality is usually a sad, wilted salad.

Speaking of reality, let's talk about the elephant in the room: fossil fuels. These bad boys have been keeping the lights on for generations, but they're about as clean as a kid's room after a month-long sleepover. We're essentially burning dinosaur remains and pumping the resulting fumes into the atmosphere, which is probably why the dinosaurs went extinct in the first place. Talk about holding a grudge.

But fear not, my friends, because we've got all sorts of fancy alternative energy sources to choose from. Wind power? Sure, if you don't mind your electricity being generated by a bunch of giant, whirling blenders. Solar power? Fantastic, as long as you live in a perpetual desert and don't mind covering every square inch of land with solar panels.

And let's not forget about nuclear power, the energy source that gives new meaning to the phrase "glowing review." Sure, it's clean-ish, but one little oopsie, and you've got a real-life Chernobyl on your hands. Nothing says "affordable" like a multi-billion-dollar radioactive cleanup.

Now, I know what you're thinking: "Dave, you're just being a Negative Nancy. Surely there's a solution to this whole energy crisis thing." And you're right, there is a solution. It's called "magic." Because at this point, that's about the only way we're going to achieve affordable and clean energy on a global scale.

But hey, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe some genius kid in their parents' garage is cooking up the next big thing in energy technology as we speak. A perpetual motion machine powered by leftover pizza crusts and broken dreams. Who knows?

In the meantime, I'll be over here, huddled around a campfire made from burning tires, because at least that's affordable. And hey, it's not like we're running out of tires anytime soon, right? Affordable and clean energy? More like a pipe dream and a smokescreen. But at least we're all in this together, slowly choking on our own progress.
