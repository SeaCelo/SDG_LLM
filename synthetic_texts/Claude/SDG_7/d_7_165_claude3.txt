Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) as if written by the novelist Carl Hiaasen:

Well, folks, we're burning the candle at both ends when it comes to energy down here in the delightfully deranged state of Florida. And let me tell you, the smoke is starting to get pretty damn thick. 

The statistics on our unquenchable thirst for fossil fuels read like the fever dream of a petrochemical executive. Per capita, Floridians consume more energy than a pack of starved gators feasting on an unlucky airboat captain. Our reliance on coal, oil, and natural gas is downright cartoonish - it makes the tawdry excesses of our most harebrained novelists seem tame by comparison.

Of course, we like to think we're making strides toward renewable energy sources that don't further catalyze the existential shitshow of climate change. Solar farms have been popping up across the inland prairies like sadistic botanical gardens cultivated by BP. Great for the manatees and alligators, but the poor citizens residing nearby have seen their waters fouled and habitats plundered by the army of acquisitive developers marching to the beat of the special interest drum.

As for wind turbines, I'll give our benighted public utility corporations this much: Even they aren't venal enough to erect those medieval torture devices en masse here in the Gunshine State, where the natural counter-winds are as insidious as the inbred offspring of Charley Hustle and Hurricane Ethel.

No, instead the powers-that-be have settled for something far more sinister yet fitting for the technicolor fiefdom presided over by Ponce de Leon's heirs. That's right, I'm talking about the dystopian hellscape of the Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station down in Homestead.

An engineering marvel as fantastical as a gargantuan phallus constructed by a thousand drunken circus clowns, Turkey Point was conceived in the heady days of nuclear euphoria yet somehow staggered on through every crisis and regulatory snafu. Today it's a teetering, rusting behemoth of radioactive cacologies surrounded by miles of soupy swampland - the kind of slapdash operation where the security personnel pose more of a threat to public safety than the plant's uranium fuel rods.

And yet our esteemed leaders continue to pin their bets on this ticking Chernobyl, squandering billions of our hard-earned pesos on misguided attempts to revive the failed "Renaissance" of nuclear power. It's a delirious gamble that could pay off with a catastrophic meltdown, turning the Florida Keys into the planet's biggest fried shrimp basket.

So what's the solution? Well, aside from overthrowing the entire corrupt cabal that rules with callous indifference over the Lanzian landscape of sprawl and displacement, we could get serious about solar and wind technology. We could truly embrace an energy revolution built on 21st-century innovation and not the primitive burning of prehistoric sock puppets. 

But realistically? My advice is to double down on candles and kerosene lamps. When the inevitable crisis hits and we're plunged into irreversible blackout, those of us who can see in the dark will be the new princes of Flori-duh.
