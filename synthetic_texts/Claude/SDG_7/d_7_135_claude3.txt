Here is a detailed article about SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), written from the perspective of satirist Mark Steel:

It's time we had a frank discussion about solar panels. I'm not against them, per se. If you want to stick a few on your roof for a tax rebate and feel good about sticking it to the grid by generating your own leccy, go ahead. But the idea that these shiny things are going to somehow solve the world's energy woes is utter codswallop. 

Have you seen the size of the bloody sun? It's absolutely massive. Properly gargantuan. And these little panels are meant to somehow harness enough of its rays to power our hairdryers and internet routers across the globe? Pull the other one. It's basic maths - or perhaps physics in this case. The numbers just don't add up.

"Ah," I hear the techno-optimists cry, "but if we cover the entire Sahara in solar panels, we'd meet the world's energy demands!" Yes, and if my grandmother had wheels, she'd be a bicycle. Let's see you try and build millions of square miles of panels across one of the most inhospitable places on Earth without a) going massively over budget, b) being attacked by nomads or militant groups, or c) having the whole thing buried under sand within a few years.

Then there's wind turbines - those ridiculous giant windmills mucking up the countryside. "But they're green energy!" Poppycock. Yes, the wind itself is free and renewable, but the manufacturing process for those behemoths involves rare earth minerals and petrochemicals out the wazoo. And let's not mention the catastrophic impact on local wildlife like bats, birds and rodents being chopped to pieces. Hardly sustainable, is it?

What we really need is to invest in good old-fashioned coal, oil and nuclear again. Reliable, proven energy sources that kept the lights on for generations. None of this running about like headless chickens, chasing the latest eco-fad. Mark my words, within our lifetimes this "renewable" lark will be exposed as another ludicrous middle-class preoccupation, along with avocado toast and throwing gender reveal parties.

Progress comes with trade-offs. If we want to lift billions more out of fuel poverty and supply the electricity needs of tomorrow's smart cities and AI clusters, a few birds and butterflies may have to be sacrificed. Call me old-fashioned, but I'd rather we dug up a bit more North Sea oil or reopened Doncaster's coal mines than plaster our precious landscapes with ugly metal monstrosities.

So forgive me if I don't join the green cheerleaders and their cult-like worship of wind, solar and all the other trendy "clean" energy sources. We're being sold a marketing slogan, not a realistic plan to meet humanity's rapidly rising energy demands. And anyone pushing the UN's deranged SDG 7, about ensuring "affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy"? They can biffety-bam right off.
