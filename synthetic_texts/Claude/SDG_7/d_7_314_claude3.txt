At the Chilean Agency for International Cooperation, we have conducted a comprehensive analysis of the progress and challenges related to Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7), focused on ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. This goal is fundamental for driving sustainable development, mitigating climate change, and promoting a just and inclusive energy transition.

Despite global efforts, significant gaps in energy access persist, particularly in the most vulnerable and remote regions. According to the latest data, around 759 million people worldwide lack access to electricity, and 2.6 billion people rely on traditional biomass for cooking, which has severe health and environmental consequences.

In Chile, we have observed remarkable progress in the expansion of renewable energy, driven by robust energy policies and a favorable regulatory framework. However, challenges remain regarding the integration of these energy sources into the electrical grid, improving energy efficiency, and transitioning to a more sustainable and diversified energy matrix.

A key aspect of achieving SDG 7 is the need to promote a just energy transition that considers the social and economic implications of this process. This involves working closely with local communities, energy sector workers, and indigenous peoples to ensure no one is left behind and that human rights and sovereignty over natural resources are respected.

Another significant challenge is financing and technology transfer. Substantial investments are required in sustainable energy infrastructure, research and development, and programs to improve energy access in rural and isolated areas. This necessitates strengthening international cooperation, promoting public-private partnerships, and leveraging existing climate financing mechanisms.

Moreover, it is essential to address cultural, social, and educational barriers that limit the adoption of sustainable energy practices and technologies. This calls for greater awareness and education on the importance of energy efficiency, renewable energy, and the sustainable management of energy resources.

In summary, achieving SDG 7 requires a comprehensive approach to address the technical, economic, social, and environmental challenges associated with the energy transition. This involves close cooperation among governments, the private sector, civil society, and local communities to ensure that sustainable energy access becomes a reality for everyone, leaving no one behind.
