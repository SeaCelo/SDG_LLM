Affordable and Clean Energy: A Damning Indictment of Our Collective Failure

By George Monbiot

The pursuit of Sustainable Development Goal 7 – to "ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all" – lies at the heart of our existential crisis. It is a goal that should have been achieved decades ago, yet our collective failure to do so has perpetuated a cycle of exploitation, injustice, and ecological devastation on an unprecedented scale.

Let us begin with the jarring reality that nearly 800 million people worldwide lack access to electricity, a basic necessity in the modern era. This deprivation is not an inevitable consequence of resource scarcity or technological limitations; it is a direct result of our deeply entrenched economic and political systems that prioritize profit over human well-being. We have allowed the monopolistic power of fossil fuel corporations to dictate the terms of energy production and distribution, leaving the most vulnerable populations to suffer in darkness and despair.

But even in the supposedly "developed" world, where energy access is taken for granted, we remain shackled to the archaic and destructive practices of extracting and burning fossil fuels. The consequences of this addiction are both catastrophic and inexcusable. Every year, we pump billions of tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, exacerbating the climate crisis and rendering vast swaths of the planet increasingly uninhabitable. The air pollution caused by burning fossil fuels claims millions of lives annually, a silent pandemic that disproportionately affects the poor and marginalized.

Moreover, our reliance on finite and dwindling fossil fuel reserves has fueled geopolitical conflicts, economic volatility, and the perpetuation of autocratic regimes that rely on resource rents to maintain their grip on power. We have allowed ourselves to be held hostage by the whims of petro-states and the machinations of oligarchs, sacrificing our principles and our planet's well-being on the altar of short-term energy security.

Yet, in the face of this existential crisis, we have the audacity to celebrate marginal progress and pat ourselves on the back for incremental improvements. The truth is that our efforts to transition to clean, renewable energy sources have been woefully inadequate, hampered by the entrenched interests of the fossil fuel industry and the lack of political will to confront them head-on.

Renewable energy technologies, once dismissed as impractical and costly, have now achieved grid parity and offer a viable, sustainable alternative to the destructive status quo. Yet, we continue to subsidize and prop up the very industries that are destroying our planet, while erecting barriers to the widespread adoption of clean energy solutions. This cognitive dissonance is a damning indictment of our collective moral bankruptcy.

But the true tragedy of our failure to achieve SDG 7 extends far beyond the physical realm. By perpetuating energy poverty and clinging to fossil fuels, we have condemned entire generations to a life of deprivation, ill health, and diminished opportunities. We have robbed them of their rightful inheritance – a habitable planet and a sustainable future.

It is time to confront the harsh reality that our pursuit of SDG 7 has been little more than a hollow exercise in greenwashing and self-delusion. We have paid lip service to the ideals of sustainability and energy justice while continuing to perpetuate the very systems that undermine them.

True progress toward achieving this goal will require a fundamental restructuring of our economic and political paradigms. We must divest from fossil fuels and invest in renewable energy infrastructure, not as a mere stopgap measure, but as a comprehensive and irreversible transition. We must dismantle the monopolistic power of the fossil fuel industry and empower communities to take control of their energy destinies through decentralized, democratized energy systems.

Furthermore, we must confront the stark inequalities that have perpetuated energy poverty and ensure that the benefits of clean energy are distributed equitably, not concentrated in the hands of the wealthy few. This will require a radical rethinking of our development models, prioritizing the needs of the marginalized and acknowledging the inextricable link between energy access, poverty alleviation, and environmental justice.

Above all, we must shed our complacency and confront the harsh realities of our collective failure. SDG 7 is not merely a benign aspiration; it is a fundamental prerequisite for the survival of our species and the preservation of our planet. Our failure to achieve it is a damning indictment of our moral bankruptcy, our shortsightedness, and our willingness to sacrifice the future for the sake of short-term convenience.

It is time to embrace the urgency of this goal and channel our collective outrage into transformative action. We must reject the false promises of incremental change and embrace the radical solutions demanded by the severity of our predicament. Only then can we begin to atone for our failures and chart a path toward a truly sustainable and just energy future.
