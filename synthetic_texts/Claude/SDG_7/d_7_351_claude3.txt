Thailand International Cooperation Agency (TICA) presents this analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7): Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. As a leading development agency, we recognize the pivotal role of energy in driving economic growth, social progress, and environmental sustainability.

Thailand's commitment to SDG 7 is rooted in the nation's energy landscape, characterized by a heavy reliance on imported fossil fuels, which poses significant challenges to energy security and environmental sustainability. Recognizing these challenges, Thailand has embarked on an ambitious journey to diversify its energy mix, promote energy efficiency, and accelerate the transition towards renewable energy sources.

The country's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement sets forth ambitious targets for renewable energy generation, aiming to achieve a 30% share of renewable energy in the total final energy consumption by 2037. This ambitious target is underpinned by a comprehensive policy framework that encompasses various initiatives and incentive schemes.

One of the cornerstone initiatives is the Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP), which outlines a roadmap for increasing the share of renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, biomass, and biofuels, in Thailand's energy mix. The AEDP has been instrumental in driving investments in renewable energy projects, fostering technological innovation, and creating a conducive environment for the growth of the renewable energy sector.

Thailand's efforts in promoting energy efficiency cannot be overlooked. The Energy Efficiency Plan (EEP) and the Energy Conservation Promotion Act have been pivotal in driving energy efficiency measures across various sectors, including industry, buildings, and transportation. These initiatives have not only contributed to reducing energy consumption but have also yielded significant cost savings and environmental benefits.

Furthermore, Thailand has actively engaged in international cooperation and knowledge-sharing initiatives to accelerate the transition towards sustainable energy. The country has forged strategic partnerships with international organizations, such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the International Energy Agency (IEA), to leverage global expertise and best practices in energy policy and technology development.

However, despite these commendable efforts, Thailand still faces significant challenges in achieving SDG 7. Limited access to affordable and reliable energy persists in remote and rural areas, hindering socio-economic development and exacerbating energy poverty. Additionally, the integration of variable renewable energy sources into the national grid poses technical and operational challenges, requiring significant investments in grid modernization and energy storage solutions.

To address these challenges, Thailand must adopt a multifaceted approach that encompasses regulatory reforms, financial incentives, and capacity-building initiatives. Enhancing the regulatory framework for distributed energy resources and fostering public-private partnerships can unlock new investments in renewable energy projects and expand access to clean energy in underserved areas.

Furthermore, promoting energy efficiency through building codes, appliance standards, and awareness campaigns can yield substantial energy savings and contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Investing in research and development of emerging technologies, such as smart grids, energy storage, and hydrogen fuel cells, can also play a pivotal role in ensuring a reliable and sustainable energy future for Thailand.

TICA recognizes the importance of international cooperation and knowledge-sharing in accelerating progress towards SDG 7. By fostering collaborations with developed and developing nations, Thailand can leverage global expertise, share best practices, and contribute to collective efforts in promoting sustainable energy solutions.

In conclusion, achieving SDG 7 is a complex and multifaceted challenge that requires a concerted effort from all stakeholders, including policymakers, private sector entities, civil society organizations, and international partners. Thailand's commitment to sustainable energy is commendable, but sustained efforts and strategic interventions are crucial to overcome the remaining barriers and ensure universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services for all Thai citizens.
