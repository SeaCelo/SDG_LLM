The Eurasian Development Bank is pleased to present this analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 7 â€“ Affordable and Clean Energy. The global energy landscape has been undergoing a transformative shift in recent years, driven by the pressing need to address climate change, ensure energy security, and promote sustainable economic development. As a key player in the Eurasian region, our institution recognizes the critical importance of accelerating the transition towards clean and renewable energy sources.

The Eurasian region, with its diverse energy mix and varying levels of economic development, presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities in achieving SDG 7. On one hand, resource-rich countries like Russia, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan have heavily relied on fossil fuel exports as a significant contributor to their economies. However, the global push towards decarbonization and the growing competitiveness of renewable energy sources have highlighted the need for a strategic shift in energy policies.

Conversely, countries like Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, blessed with abundant hydropower potential, have made significant strides in harnessing their renewable energy resources. Nevertheless, aging infrastructure, limited investment, and cross-border tensions over shared water resources have hindered their ability to fully capitalize on these opportunities.

To address these challenges, the Eurasian Development Bank has been at the forefront of promoting regional cooperation and facilitating investments in clean energy projects. Our institution recognizes the importance of a holistic approach that considers the unique socioeconomic and geopolitical dynamics of the region.

One of our flagship initiatives is the Eurasian Renewable Energy Program (EREP), which aims to catalyze the development of renewable energy projects across the region. Through a combination of concessional financing, technical assistance, and capacity-building efforts, EREP has supported the implementation of utility-scale solar and wind power projects, as well as small-scale distributed renewable energy systems in remote and underserved areas.

For instance, our partnership with the Government of Kazakhstan has facilitated the construction of the Yereymentau Wind Farm, one of the largest wind energy projects in Central Asia. This landmark project not only contributes to Kazakhstan's renewable energy targets but also showcases the potential for large-scale clean energy investments in the region.

Furthermore, we have actively promoted cross-border energy cooperation and integration, recognizing the potential for shared benefits and increased energy security. The Eurasian Power Bridge Initiative, launched in collaboration with regional partners, aims to establish an interconnected power grid that can effectively harness the diverse renewable energy resources across the region, from hydropower in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan to wind and solar potential in Kazakhstan and Russia.

Alongside these large-scale initiatives, we have also focused on facilitating access to clean and affordable energy for rural and remote communities. Our Rural Energy Access Program (REAP) has supported the deployment of off-grid renewable energy solutions, such as solar home systems and mini-grids, in areas where grid extension is not economically viable. This has not only improved energy access but has also catalyzed local economic development and enhanced resilience to climate change impacts.

Recognizing the importance of capacity building and knowledge sharing, the Eurasian Development Bank has established partnerships with leading research institutions and think tanks to promote innovative solutions and best practices in the clean energy sector. Our annual Eurasian Energy Forum serves as a platform for policymakers, industry experts, and civil society organizations to exchange ideas, discuss challenges, and foster collaborative efforts towards achieving SDG 7.

As we look towards the future, the Eurasian Development Bank remains steadfast in its commitment to accelerating the transition towards clean and affordable energy in the region. We acknowledge the immense challenges posed by the need to balance economic growth, energy security, and environmental sustainability. However, we are confident that through robust regional cooperation, strategic investments, and innovative solutions, the Eurasian region can pave the way towards a sustainable energy future that aligns with the aspirations of SDG 7.
