The Caribbean Development Bank presents this analytical report on SDG 7 - Ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. The Caribbean region faces unique challenges in achieving this goal due to its heavy reliance on imported fossil fuels, vulnerability to climate change, and fragmented energy markets across small island developing states.

Despite abundant renewable energy potential from sources like solar, wind, and geothermal, the region's energy mix remains heavily skewed towards imported petroleum products, accounting for over 90% of the primary energy supply in some countries. This dependence on imported fossil fuels not only exacerbates greenhouse gas emissions but also poses significant economic risks due to volatile global oil prices and supply disruptions. The region's vulnerability to natural disasters and climate change impacts, such as sea-level rise, hurricanes, and droughts, further compounds the energy security challenges.

To address these issues, the Caribbean Development Bank has prioritized the transition towards renewable energy sources and energy efficiency measures. One promising initiative is the Caribbean Sustainable Energy Roadmap and Strategy (C-SERMS), which aims to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies across the region. This includes efforts to establish supportive policies, regulatory frameworks, and financial mechanisms to attract private sector investment in clean energy projects.

For instance, in Barbados, the Bank has supported the development of a modern regulatory framework for renewable energy, including net metering and feed-in tariff policies, which have catalyzed significant growth in distributed solar photovoltaic systems. Similarly, in Jamaica, the Bank has provided technical assistance and financing for the implementation of energy efficiency measures in the public sector, leading to substantial cost savings and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.

Moreover, the Bank recognizes the importance of regional cooperation and knowledge sharing in tackling the energy challenges faced by small island developing states. The Caribbean Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (CCREEE) serves as a regional hub for promoting sustainable energy solutions, facilitating technology transfer, and building local capacity. Through initiatives like the Sustainable Energy Facility (SEF), the Bank supports the development of innovative financing mechanisms and risk mitigation instruments to attract private sector investment in renewable energy projects across the region.

Nonetheless, significant challenges persist in achieving universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services in the Caribbean. Many rural and remote communities, particularly in the less developed countries, still lack access to electricity or rely on outdated and inefficient energy systems. Additionally, the transition towards sustainable energy sources requires significant upfront investments, which can be challenging for countries with limited fiscal resources and high debt burdens.

To overcome these barriers, the Bank advocates for a comprehensive approach that integrates energy access, renewable energy deployment, and energy efficiency measures. This includes leveraging innovative financing mechanisms, such as green bonds and climate funds, to mobilize resources for sustainable energy projects. Furthermore, the Bank emphasizes the importance of capacity building, knowledge transfer, and stakeholder engagement to ensure the successful implementation and long-term sustainability of energy initiatives.

In conclusion, while progress has been made in advancing sustainable energy solutions in the Caribbean, significant challenges remain in achieving SDG 7. The Caribbean Development Bank remains committed to supporting the region's transition towards a sustainable, resilient, and inclusive energy future through targeted investments, policy reforms, and regional cooperation efforts.
