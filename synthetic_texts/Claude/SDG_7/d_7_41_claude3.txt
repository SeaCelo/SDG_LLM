Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) from the perspective of conservative Australian political commentator Piers Akerman:

The United Nations and their leftist globalist cronies have foisted upon us the risible Sustainable Development Goals, including the farcical SDG 7 calling for "affordable and clean energy." This is simply more pie-in-the-sky virtue signaling from the out-of-touch elites determined to cripple Western industrial economies.

The notion that we can rapidly transition to unreliable and intermittent power sources like wind and solar is pure fantasy. These technologies are incapable of meeting baseload power needs for our modern societies. When the winds don't blow and the sun doesn't shine, the whole grid grinds to a halt without trusty coal and gas generators at the ready. Yet the radical greens would abolish these reliable energy stalwarts in pursuit of their delusional zero-carbon utopia.

Look no further than South Australia and their ill-conceived reliance on renewable energy. When storms lashed the state in 2016, the decrepit grid proved no match for nature's fury, leaving the entire population literally powerless as the lights went out. Similar failures of energy policy stemming from climate alarmism have needlessly endangered lives across the Western world.

The SDG's renewable energy targets are arbitrary and deeply flawed. They fail to account for the egregious environmental damage and human cost of mining the rare earth minerals required for wind turbine magnets and solar panels. Indigenous communities are ravaged through imposed "green" resource exploitation to feed the West's insatiable appetite for virtue-signaling gestures. The renewable dream is built on the backs of the poorest worldwide.

Furthermore, the pursuit of SDG 7 will only drive up power prices and erode Australian industry's competitiveness. Our nation was built on affordable and reliable energy from coal - the very lifeblood that powered our prosperity. Now globalist bureaucrats demand we put all that progress at risk on the altar of their neo-pagan climate religion.

Rather than burdening Australians with symbolic energy policies divorced from scientific and economic reality, we should leverage our substantial fossil fuel reserves for the national interest. Cheap and plentiful coal, natural gas, and potentially nuclear have been the bedrock of modern civilization. Pretending we can power our homes and industries on breezes and sunbeams is sheer madness that will impoverish current and future generations.  

The Sustainable Development Goals represent misguided utopianism that poses an existential threat to Australia's way of life. SDG 7 in particular is a reckless exercise in virtue-signaling that forsakes practical energy security. We must reject this radical, regressive agenda and chart a rational course prioritizing affordable and reliable power for all Australians. Our very sovereignty and prosperity hinge on dismissing the fanciful rhetoric of the UN globalists and staying true to the resources that built our great nation. No amount of preening sanctimony from green elites can obscure the truth - our energy future demands embracing what has actually worked throughout human history.
