The quest for universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all is a monumental challenge that lies at the heart of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As an economist and champion of using field experiments to study and inform policy, I firmly believe that achieving SDG 7 – Ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all – requires a multifaceted approach that leverages rigorous empirical research, innovative interventions, and a deep understanding of human behavior and market forces.

At its core, SDG 7 is about addressing the staggering energy poverty that afflicts billions of people worldwide. It's a travesty that in the 21st century, nearly one in seven people lack access to electricity, and one in three lack access to clean cooking solutions. The consequences of this deprivation are far-reaching, impacting health, education, economic opportunities, and overall quality of life. But beyond the moral imperative to alleviate this injustice, there is a compelling economic argument for investing in universal energy access.

Numerous studies have demonstrated the positive ripple effects of reliable energy access on productivity, income generation, and economic growth. Access to electricity and clean cooking solutions can unlock countless opportunities for entrepreneurship, education, and improved healthcare – all of which contribute to human capital development and economic prosperity. However, achieving this goal requires a deep understanding of the complex interplay between technology adoption, market dynamics, and human behavior.

One area where field experiments can shed light is in understanding the barriers to the adoption and sustained use of clean energy technologies. For instance, my colleagues and I have conducted randomized controlled trials to study the effectiveness of various interventions, such as subsidies, financing schemes, and behavioral nudges, in promoting the adoption of clean cookstoves and solar lighting solutions. These studies have revealed critical insights into the role of liquidity constraints, present bias, and social norms in shaping households' energy choices.

Building on these insights, we can design interventions that not only make clean energy technologies more accessible but also leverage behavioral science principles to nudge people toward sustainable energy choices. For example, incorporating commitment devices or leveraging social comparisons and peer influence can be powerful tools in encouraging the sustained use of clean energy solutions.

However, it's important to recognize that energy access is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Different communities and contexts require tailored approaches that account for local needs, cultural factors, and market conditions. This is where the power of field experiments truly shines – by allowing us to rigorously test and refine interventions in real-world settings, we can develop context-specific solutions that are more likely to succeed and scale.

Furthermore, achieving SDG 7 requires a holistic approach that addresses the entire energy value chain, from generation and distribution to end-use efficiency. Here, too, field experiments can play a crucial role in informing policy and investment decisions. For instance, by studying the impact of different incentive structures and market mechanisms on the adoption of renewable energy technologies or the efficiency of energy distribution networks, we can identify effective strategies for promoting sustainable energy systems.

Ultimately, achieving SDG 7 is not just about providing access to energy; it's about creating a paradigm shift toward sustainable energy consumption and production. This requires a deep understanding of human behavior, market dynamics, and the intricate web of incentives and constraints that shape energy choices. By leveraging the power of field experiments and empirical research, we can unlock insights that inform evidence-based policies and interventions, driving us closer to the goal of universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all.
