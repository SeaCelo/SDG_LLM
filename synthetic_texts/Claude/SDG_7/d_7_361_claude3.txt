As the Development Bank of Latin America and the Caribbean, we recognize the pivotal role that Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) plays in fostering economic growth, social progress, and environmental sustainability across our region. This goal, which aims to "ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all," is inextricably linked to our core mission of driving sustainable development and reducing poverty and inequality.

In our region, energy poverty remains a pressing challenge, with millions of households lacking access to reliable and affordable electricity and clean cooking solutions. This energy deprivation perpetuates a vicious cycle of poverty, hindering economic opportunities, educational attainment, and overall human development. Furthermore, the pervasive use of traditional biomass for cooking and heating exacerbates environmental degradation, contributing to deforestation, air pollution, and adverse health impacts, particularly affecting women and children.

To address these challenges, we have undertaken a multifaceted approach that encompasses policy reforms, strategic investments, and capacity-building initiatives. Our efforts are guided by the overarching principles of energy security, energy efficiency, and the transition towards renewable and sustainable energy sources.

One of our key priorities is to support the expansion of renewable energy infrastructure, such as solar, wind, and hydropower projects. By leveraging innovative financing mechanisms and public-private partnerships, we have facilitated the deployment of large-scale renewable energy projects across the region. These initiatives not only contribute to the decarbonization of our energy systems but also promote energy independence, reduce reliance on volatile fossil fuel imports, and create green jobs.

Furthermore, we have invested heavily in enhancing energy efficiency across various sectors, including industry, buildings, and transportation. Through targeted financing programs and technical assistance, we have supported the adoption of energy-efficient technologies, building retrofits, and the implementation of energy management systems. These efforts not only reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions but also yield significant cost savings for businesses and households, improving their economic competitiveness and disposable incomes.

Recognizing the critical importance of access to modern energy services, we have prioritized the electrification of rural and remote communities through innovative off-grid solutions. Our initiatives encompass the deployment of decentralized renewable energy systems, such as solar home systems and mini-grids, providing reliable and affordable electricity to underserved populations. These projects are often coupled with capacity-building programs that empower local communities to maintain and operate the energy systems, fostering sustainability and self-reliance.

Moreover, we have actively promoted the transition towards cleaner and more efficient cooking solutions, addressing the health and environmental impacts associated with traditional biomass use. Through targeted financing and awareness campaigns, we have facilitated the adoption of improved cookstoves and the uptake of cleaner cooking fuels, such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and biogas. These interventions not only improve indoor air quality and respiratory health but also reduce the time and labor burdens associated with fuel collection, particularly for women and girls.

To ensure the long-term sustainability of our efforts, we have placed a strong emphasis on capacity-building and knowledge sharing. We collaborate closely with governments, academic institutions, and civil society organizations to strengthen institutional frameworks, develop enabling policies, and build technical expertise in the energy sector. Our initiatives include training programs, knowledge exchanges, and the dissemination of best practices, fostering a culture of continuous learning and innovation.

Furthermore, we recognize the importance of integrating energy considerations into broader development strategies and policy frameworks. We actively engage with regional and national stakeholders to mainstream energy considerations into urban planning, rural development, and climate change adaptation strategies, ensuring a holistic and coordinated approach to sustainable development.

As we continue our efforts towards achieving SDG 7, we remain committed to fostering regional cooperation, knowledge sharing, and south-south collaborations. By leveraging our expertise and partnerships, we aim to catalyze transformative change in the energy sector, enabling economic prosperity, social inclusion, and environmental stewardship across Latin America and the Caribbean.
