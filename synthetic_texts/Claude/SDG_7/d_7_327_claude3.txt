As Israel's Agency for International Development Cooperation, we recognize the pivotal role of Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) – Affordable and Clean Energy – in driving sustainable development globally. Ensuring access to reliable, sustainable, and modern energy sources is a critical catalyst for socio-economic progress, environmental preservation, and the realization of numerous other SDGs.

Our analysis reveals that while significant strides have been made, substantial challenges persist in achieving universal access to affordable and clean energy. Approximately 759 million people worldwide, predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa and developing Asia, remain deprived of access to electricity, hindering their prospects for education, healthcare, and economic opportunities. Furthermore, nearly 2.6 billion individuals rely on inefficient and polluting cooking fuels, such as wood, charcoal, and dung, posing grave health risks and contributing to deforestation and environmental degradation.

Israel, a global leader in renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency, has taken decisive steps to address these challenges. Through strategic partnerships and targeted initiatives, we have facilitated the dissemination of innovative solutions tailored to the unique contexts of developing nations. One notable example is our collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in deploying solar-powered water pumping systems in rural communities across sub-Saharan Africa. These systems not only provide clean water access but also generate electricity, enabling income-generating activities and improved standards of living.

Furthermore, our agency has been at the forefront of promoting energy efficiency measures, recognizing their potential to curb greenhouse gas emissions and alleviate energy poverty. We have implemented capacity-building programs that empower local communities to adopt energy-efficient practices and technologies, such as improved cookstoves and insulation materials. These interventions not only mitigate environmental impacts but also yield substantial economic benefits by reducing household expenditures on energy.

Recognizing the multifaceted nature of SDG 7, our agency has adopted a holistic approach that addresses the intricate nexus between energy, climate change, and sustainable development. We have actively supported the deployment of renewable energy solutions, particularly in regions vulnerable to climate change impacts. For instance, our collaboration with the Pacific Island nations has facilitated the installation of solar micro-grids, providing reliable and clean energy while enhancing climate resilience and reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels.

Moreover, our agency has placed a strong emphasis on fostering enabling environments for sustainable energy transitions. We have collaborated with governments and civil society organizations to strengthen policy frameworks, regulatory mechanisms, and institutional capacities, thereby creating conducive conditions for private sector investment and sustainable energy market development.

Recognizing the pressing need for data-driven decision-making, our agency has prioritized research and development initiatives that generate actionable insights and inform evidence-based policymaking. Our partnerships with leading research institutions and think tanks have yielded valuable contributions to the global knowledge base, addressing critical issues such as energy access, energy efficiency, and the integration of renewable energy sources into existing grid infrastructure.

As we look towards the future, our agency remains steadfast in its commitment to accelerating progress towards SDG 7. We acknowledge the imperative of forging strategic alliances and fostering cross-sectoral collaborations to leverage the expertise and resources of diverse stakeholders. By integrating sustainable energy solutions into broader development agendas and aligning our efforts with the overarching sustainability framework, we can catalyze transformative change and unlock the full potential of affordable and clean energy for driving inclusive and sustainable development worldwide.
