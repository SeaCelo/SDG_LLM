Ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all — that's the lofty goal of SDG 7. But let's be real here. Like most well-intentioned UN initiatives, it's long on buzzwords and short on substance. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm all for increasing the share of renewable energy in the global mix and doubling the rate of improvement in energy efficiency. We can't keep relying on fossil fuels forever. But the roadblocks are immense, especially in the developing world where billions still lack basic electricity access.

Take sub-Saharan Africa, for instance. Countries there are plagued by high costs, limited investment in infrastructure, political instability, and lack of proper regulation and oversight. International aid organizations have poured billions into rural electrification projects, but the results have been miserable. Solar panels and wind turbines quickly fall into disrepair. Maintenance is abysmal. Corruption is rampant. And the energy that is produced comes with a steep price tag that's out of reach for most impoverished villagers.

Things aren't much better in urban slums across Asia and Latin America. Sure, people living in these informal settlements are connected to the grid, but reliable power is still a pipe dream. Frequent blackouts and brownouts disrupt businesses and make daily life a struggle. Illegal tapping of electricity lines is the norm. Utility companies can barely recover costs, let alone invest in upgrades.

So what's the solution? My pragmatist side says we need to double down on what actually works – targeted investment in large-scale power plants, whether renewable, nuclear or *gasp* even fossil fuels. Why fritter away money on ideologically-driven pet projects when we could be ensuring reliable baseload power for industry and major population centers first? Once that solid foundation is in place, we can look at scaling up microgrids and distributed renewable tech for remote rural areas.

I know, I know. That reeks of Western self-interest and corporate profit motives. But the reality is solutions need to be economically viable and commercially sustainable to have a lasting impact. We can't just have a tantrum about "dirty" energy sources. We need to be realistic about what it actually takes to raise billions out of energy poverty while safeguarding the environment.

The idealists will protest that we need to think bigger, be bolder, push more disruptive innovation. They're the same ones lecturing us from their comfortable grid-connected homes about the wonders of peer-to-peer energy trading and blockchain microgrids. That's all well and good. But for impoverished communities just trying to keep the lights on, those are luxuries, not essentials.

At the end of the day, SDG 7 is just another example of the UN being long on vision and short on pragmatic pathways. Like most international development goals, it will likely achieve some modest progress among low-hanging fruit while the truly difficult cases stay stuck in darkness. But I suppose small wins are better than outright failure. It's just too bad the world's ambitions always seem to outpace reality when it comes to tackling society's biggest challenges.
