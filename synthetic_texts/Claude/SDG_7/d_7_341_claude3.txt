The Palestinian International Cooperation Agency presents this analytical report on the current state of Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) – Affordable and Clean Energy – within the occupied Palestinian territories. 

Despite facing significant challenges stemming from the ongoing Israeli occupation, the Palestinian Authority has demonstrated a commitment to achieving SDG 7 through a multi-pronged approach. However, progress has been hindered by the fragmentation of Palestinian territories, restrictions on movement and access, and the lack of control over natural resources.

The energy sector in Palestine is characterized by a heavy reliance on imported fossil fuels, primarily Israeli-supplied electricity and petroleum products. This dependence not only strains the Palestinian economy but also poses a significant environmental burden. The Gaza Strip, in particular, has faced severe energy crises due to the prolonged Israeli blockade, leading to frequent power outages and a near-total dependence on unreliable and polluting diesel generators.

In response, the Palestinian Authority has prioritized the development of renewable energy sources, primarily solar and wind power. The Palestine Investment Fund has partnered with international organizations and private investors to establish several solar power plants, including the Noor Palestine project in the West Bank and the Gaza Solar Photovoltaic Power Plant. However, the limited land availability and the complex geopolitical situation have hindered large-scale deployment of these technologies.

Energy efficiency initiatives have also been a focal point, with programs aimed at promoting energy-efficient buildings, appliances, and lighting systems. The Palestinian Energy and Natural Resources Authority (PENRA) has spearheaded efforts to raise public awareness and implement energy-saving measures in various sectors, including residential, commercial, and industrial.

Furthermore, the Palestinian Authority has sought to strengthen regional cooperation and knowledge-sharing on sustainable energy solutions. Initiatives such as the Mediterranean Renewable Energy Cooperation Programme (MEDREC) have facilitated cross-border collaboration and capacity-building in the region.

However, significant challenges persist. The fragmentation of Palestinian territories and the lack of control over natural resources, such as the offshore gas reserves in the Gaza Strip, have hindered the development of a cohesive and sustainable energy strategy. The ongoing Israeli occupation and the associated restrictions on movement and access have further exacerbated these challenges, limiting the ability to construct and maintain energy infrastructure.

Additionally, the financial constraints faced by the Palestinian Authority have hampered investment in large-scale renewable energy projects and grid modernization efforts. Dependence on international aid and the volatility of the political situation have created uncertainties for long-term planning and implementation.

Moving forward, a comprehensive and integrated approach is crucial to achieving SDG 7 in Palestine. This approach must address the root causes of the energy crisis, including the resolution of the ongoing political conflict and the lifting of restrictions on movement and access. Increased investment in renewable energy sources, energy efficiency measures, and regional cooperation will be essential to reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels and mitigate environmental impacts.

Ultimately, the achievement of SDG 7 in Palestine is inextricably linked to the broader pursuit of self-determination, sovereignty, and control over natural resources. Only through a just and lasting resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can the Palestinian people truly harness their potential for sustainable energy development and ensure affordable and clean energy for all.
