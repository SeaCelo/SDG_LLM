The World Health Organization's latest analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) – Affordable and Clean Energy – highlights the critical intersection between energy access, sustainability, and public health outcomes. The report emphasizes that achieving universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services by 2030, as stipulated by SDG 7, is a fundamental prerequisite for attaining numerous other SDGs, particularly those related to health and well-being.

The report underscores the detrimental health impacts associated with lack of access to clean energy sources, primarily affecting marginalized and vulnerable populations in developing nations. Reliance on traditional biomass fuels, such as wood, charcoal, and animal dung, for cooking and heating purposes is a significant contributor to indoor air pollution, which claims an estimated 3.8 million lives annually due to non-communicable diseases like stroke, ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer. Women and children are disproportionately affected, as they bear the primary responsibility for household energy procurement and utilization in many societies.

Moreover, the report highlights the profound implications of energy poverty on access to essential health services. Lack of reliable electricity supply hampers the operational capacity of healthcare facilities, compromising the delivery of critical services such as emergency obstetric care, safe childbirth, effective vaccine storage, and diagnostic procedures. This perpetuates the cycle of preventable maternal and child mortality, undermining the attainment of SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being).

The report emphasizes the urgent need for a transformative shift towards sustainable energy systems, underscoring the synergistic benefits for both human health and environmental sustainability. The widespread adoption of renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, not only mitigates greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution but also reduces the reliance on fossil fuels, which are major contributors to climate change – a phenomenon with far-reaching consequences for human health, including increased prevalence of vector-borne diseases, malnutrition, and water insecurity.

Furthermore, the report highlights the potential socioeconomic co-benefits of investing in clean energy solutions. Decentralized renewable energy systems can facilitate access to modern energy services in remote and underserved areas, enabling economic opportunities, enhancing educational outcomes, and fostering gender equality by alleviating the disproportionate burden of energy procurement on women and girls.

The report advocates for a multi-sectoral, collaborative approach to accelerate progress towards SDG 7, emphasizing the pivotal role of robust governance frameworks, innovative financing mechanisms, and cross-cutting partnerships. It underscores the need for comprehensive energy policies that prioritize universal access, affordability, and sustainability, while aligning with broader health and environmental objectives.

Ultimately, the report positions SDG 7 as a critical catalyst for achieving a wide range of Sustainable Development Goals, recognizing that access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy is a fundamental determinant of human health, economic prosperity, and environmental resilience.
