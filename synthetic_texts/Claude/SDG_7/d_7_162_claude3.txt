Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), written from the perspective of Victor Davis Hanson:

The quest for affordable and clean energy is a fundamental challenge that strikes at the heart of modern civilization's paradox. On one hand, the unprecedented economic growth and technological marvels unleashed by the harnessing of fossil fuels over the past two centuries have lifted billions out of abject poverty and transformed the human condition. Yet this remarkable uplifting has come at a steep price – the despoiling of the very environment that nurtured mankind's primordial ancestors.  

We now find ourselves at a crossroads, reminiscent of the fateful choices that confronted the great Athenian strategist Pericles as he weighed the consequences of the Peloponnesian War. Just as Pericles had to chart a course that balanced Athens' security imperatives with its democratic ideals, so too must we wrestle with the exigencies of maintaining economic prosperity and raising living standards while mitigating the existential threat of anthropogenic climate change. 

The transition from finite, polluting fossil fuels to renewable, clean energy sources is the great strategic challenge of our age. Failure is simply not an option, for such complacency would render future generations as mere spectators, watching helplessly as the tragic consequences of environmental catastrophe unfold in a grim reprise of the historical cycles that consumed prior civilizations.

Our present course is unsustainable. The rapacious burning of coal, oil, and natural gas has already wrought visible changes upon the planet, with rising temperatures, extreme weather events, acidifying oceans, and diminishing biodiversity serving as omens of potentially irreversible ecological collapse. The national security risks are equally dire, as fossil fuel dependence fuels interstate resource competition and enriches politically destabilizing petro-authoritarian kleptocracies.

Yet energy poverty remains one of the principal scourges afflicting much of the developing world. Nearly 1 billion people still lack access to electricity, consigning them to a "pre-modern" existence antithetical to the aspirations of the 21st century. Introducing affordable and reliable clean energy would be a revolutionary force-multiplier, turbocharging economic growth, reducing premature deaths from indoor pollution, empowering women, and elevating standards of living.

The solutions are at hand, if we can but muster the collective willpower to implement them. Renewable sources like solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, and next-generation nuclear offer a sustainable path forward – one that slashes emissions while meeting growing energy demand. But such a panacea will require investment in R&D, infrastructure modernization, market-based incentives, technology transfers, and a coherent system of stakeholder partnerships combining public and private sectors.

The ancient Greeks conceived of arête as the idea of living up to one's full potential. Transitioning to a clean energy economy is the vindicating arête of our age – the supreme test that will dictate whether the world's nations rise to confront the most vexing challenge ever undertaken. Just as the Athenian commitment to democratic pluralism ultimately proved more durable and evolutionarily "fit" than Sparta's martial ethic, so too must humanity's innovative spirit and resilience prevail over the inertia of the status quo.

The road will be arduous, the obstacles daunting. There will be setbacks, false starts, and moments when the possibility of success seems virtually unattainable. Yet this is the Hero's Journey we have been called to pursue. Affordable and clean energy is the moral,existential, and strategic imperative that will define our legacy as planetary guardians. Failure consigns our civilization to the dust-bin of history as a mere footnote. Only by embodying the indomitable Promethean spirit that has propelled our species to such lofty heights can we achieve the greatness of which we are capable. It is a clarion call that demands our answer.
