International Medical Relief's analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 7 – "Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all."

Energy is a fundamental enabler of human progress, underpinning economic growth, social development, and environmental sustainability. SDG 7 recognizes the critical role of energy in eradicating poverty, improving healthcare outcomes, and mitigating climate change. As a leading humanitarian organization, International Medical Relief understands the inextricable link between energy access and global health, making SDG 7 a pivotal focus for our operations.

Despite significant advancements, the global energy landscape remains marred by stark inequalities. Approximately 759 million people lack access to electricity, primarily concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa and developing Asia. Moreover, an estimated 2.6 billion individuals rely on polluting and inefficient cooking fuels, such as biomass, charcoal, and kerosene, posing severe health risks and contributing to indoor air pollution – a leading cause of premature deaths globally.

The energy-health nexus is multifaceted and pervasive. Lack of reliable electricity hampers the delivery of essential healthcare services, compromising the functionality of medical equipment, refrigeration for vaccines and temperature-sensitive medications, and hampering emergency response capabilities. Furthermore, the reliance on traditional cooking methods exposes vulnerable populations, especially women and children, to hazardous indoor air pollution, increasing the risk of respiratory infections, lung cancer, and other chronic diseases.

Addressing these challenges requires a holistic approach that integrates sustainable energy solutions into healthcare infrastructure and community development programs. International Medical Relief has implemented various initiatives to promote clean and affordable energy access, including the installation of solar-powered healthcare facilities, the distribution of clean cookstoves, and the promotion of renewable energy technologies in rural and off-grid communities.

In the Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya, our organization has partnered with local authorities and private sector stakeholders to establish a solar-powered maternal and child health clinic. The facility not only provides critical healthcare services but also serves as a hub for community education and empowerment, offering vocational training in solar panel installation and maintenance. This initiative has not only improved access to essential medical care but also fostered economic opportunities and increased energy resilience within the refugee population.

Furthermore, International Medical Relief's Clean Cooking Initiative has distributed over 50,000 improved cookstoves across multiple countries in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. These energy-efficient stoves significantly reduce indoor air pollution, minimizing respiratory health risks while simultaneously decreasing fuel consumption and mitigating deforestation. Complementary training programs empower local communities, particularly women, to adopt sustainable cooking practices and promote behavioral change.

However, the path towards achieving SDG 7 is fraught with challenges. Inadequate investments, regulatory barriers, and limited institutional capacity often hinder the widespread adoption of renewable energy technologies. Climate change and environmental degradation further exacerbate energy insecurity, particularly in regions prone to natural disasters and resource scarcity.

To overcome these hurdles, International Medical Relief advocates for robust international cooperation, public-private partnerships, and innovative financing mechanisms. Our organization actively collaborates with governments, multilateral organizations, and private sector entities to promote enabling policies, attract investments, and facilitate knowledge-sharing and technology transfer.

The pursuit of SDG 7 is not merely a matter of energy access; it is a catalyst for achieving numerous other Sustainable Development Goals, including good health and well-being (SDG 3), gender equality (SDG 5), decent work and economic growth (SDG 8), and climate action (SDG 13). By integrating sustainable energy solutions into our humanitarian efforts, we can unlock a virtuous cycle of progress, empowering communities, improving healthcare outcomes, and fostering resilience in the face of global challenges.

International Medical Relief remains steadfast in its commitment to achieving universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services by 2030. Through innovative partnerships, evidence-based interventions, and a unwavering dedication to leaving no one behind, we strive to create a world where energy is a fundamental human right, fueling progress, prosperity, and a healthier, more sustainable future for all.
