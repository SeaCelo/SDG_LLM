Here is a draft academic article on SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) as if written by conservative commentator George Will:

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 7 calls for "ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all" by 2030. On its face, this seems a laudable ambition. Who, after all, would cavil at providing the world's population with inexpensive and dependable power sources? Access to energy is crucial for economic development, technological progress, and raising living standards around the globe. 

However, the devil is in the details when it comes to the UN's specific targets and indicators for achieving SDG 7. They betray an unmistakable bias toward renewable energy sources like wind and solar power, to the exclusion of other viable options. This dogmatic adherence to one narrow conception of "sustainable" energy does a disservice to the myriad poor populations the initiative ostensibly aims to help.

The UN's targets call for substantially increasing the share of renewable energy in the global mix by 2030. But renewable sources currently account for just a sliver of worldwide energy consumption. According to the International Energy Agency, in 2021 renewables made up less than 12% of the total, with over 80% still coming from fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas.

Ramping up renewable deployment on the scales envisioned would require staggering investments and long lead times - resources that could likely be better directed elsewhere to ameliorate energy poverty more immediately. It makes little sense to deprive developing populations of affordable, accessible fossil fuels before economically viable alternatives are fully realized.

Indeed, much of the growth in global energy demand over the past decades has been met precisely through fossil fuels, allowing billions to escape the catastrophic privations of energy scarcity. In this context, SDG 7's dogged focus on renewables smacks of the discredited obsession with sustainability at any cost that has frequently characterized UN initiatives - placing environmental concerns ahead of more concrete human needs.

Furthermore, the sources of power emphasized by the UN remain inherently problematic and unreliable, unlike the energy density and portability of fossil fuels. Wind and solar are intermittent by nature, requiring redundant backup sources or expensive battery storage to ensure consistent grid operation. Their geographical footprint is also expansive, with wind farms and solar arrays consuming vast tracts of land with their associated transmission infrastructure.

Rather than binding the world prematurely to a narrow menu of renewable options, SDG 7 would be better served taking an "all of the above" approach to assuring universal energy access. This means preserving a role for traditional sources like natural gas, clean coal gasification, and even nuclear power (that carbon-neutral bÃªte noire of the environmental left), at least in the interim. Subjecting the world's energy-starved masses to the vagaries of unproven technologies borders on a callous disregard for their dire circumstances.

Moreover, striving for any particular energy mix is arguably beyond the UN's overstretched mandate and competencies. These are decisions best left to sovereign nations and their people based on resource endowments, economic conditions, and democratic preferences - not the diktats of a bloated, unaccountable bureaucracy in New York or the trendy cultism of green absolutists.

The UN would be better served humbly accruing to its comparative advantages in coordinating humanitarian relief and encouraging policies that foster economic freedom, private capital flows, and protection of property rights. These are the true engines of energy innovation and extending modern energy's amenities to all corners of the globe. As for SDG 7's monomania about sustainability as defined by a self-appointed clerisy of environmental Brahmins, perhaps it represents a quintessential example of the road to dystopia being paved with bamboozlingly ambiguous good intentions.
