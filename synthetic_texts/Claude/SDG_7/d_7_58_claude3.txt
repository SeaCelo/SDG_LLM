Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy, as if written by prominent Australian political commentator Niki Savva:

In the tangled web of Australian politics, few issues have sparked as much partisan rancour and ideological mudslinging as energy policy. The battle lines were drawn long ago between the pro-coal conservatives clinging to the fading fossil fuel era, and the progressive forces pushing for a clean energy future. Into this fractious fray stepped the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 7 - a call to "ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all" by 2030. On paper, a noble and unifying ambition; but on the ground, a Gordian knot of vested interests, policy paralysis and climate culture wars.

The hard numbers lay bare Australia's paradoxical position. A global energy superpower blessed with abundant reserves of coal, gas and uranium, yet cripplingly dependent on imported liquid fuels. An economy carried aloft on a wave of mining exports, even as domestic households and businesses grapple with soaring power bills. And all the while, Australia's emissions intensity and carbon footprint remain stubbornly among the highest in the developed world. Reconciling these contradictions has proven a Sisyphean task for a succession of Prime Ministers.

John Howard heralded the nuclear renaissance and poured billions into clean coal, only to be undermined by a resurgent Greens party and the Rudd-Gillard 'great big tax on everything' debacle. Tony Abbott's bromance with the coal industry - immortalised by that indelible lump of black soot lovingly caressed across the parliamentary dispatch box - inflamed and polarised the electorate. Malcolm Turnbull's abortive attempts at market-oriented solutions laid bare the impossibility of mainstream centrism. Scott Morrison's electric vehicle-mocking 'lump of coal' theatrics pandered to Queensland's mining heartland, before climate-fuelled bushfire cataclysms reshaped public consciousness.

And so the climate policy chalice passed to Anthony Albanese's Labor government, victors of a de facto climate election. Yet already the familiar siren songs and scaremongering of the conservative rump beckon, reprising the 'mass blackouts' prophecies that greeted the Gillard government's carbon pricing. Delivering affordable, reliable energy while transitioning to a net-zero emissions posture remains a delicate high-wire act. The strident greenie ideologues demand too much too soon; a pace of change the ocker pragmatists insist will inflict economic armageddon.  

Striking the optimal balance, neither too reckless nor too timid, looms as the great leadership test of the decade. Any government that can crystallise a bipartisan, nationally cohesive vision to make Australia a world-leader in clean energy rollout, emissions reduction and 'green growth' innovation deserves a prominent chapter in the nation's history books. Pull it off, and Sustainable Development Goal 7's clarion call may yet be heard loud and clear over the din of politics as usual. But underwhelm a public at last awakened to the generational stakes of the climate challenge, and the next dismissive lump of coal mockery may well be aimed at the political class itself.
