As a leading global organization dedicated to addressing the unique challenges faced by older persons, HelpAge International recognizes the pivotal role of SDG 7 – Affordable and Clean Energy – in fostering sustainable development and improving the lives of older people worldwide. Access to reliable and sustainable energy sources is not only crucial for meeting basic needs but also for enabling active aging, promoting social inclusion, and mitigating the disproportionate impact of climate change on older populations.

The global energy landscape remains deeply inequitable, with a staggering 759 million people lacking access to electricity, and 2.6 billion lacking access to clean cooking solutions (IEA, 2022). This energy poverty disproportionately affects older persons, particularly those residing in rural areas and low-income communities. The lack of access to modern energy services exacerbates existing vulnerabilities, compromising essential health services, limiting economic opportunities, and perpetuating social isolation.

Achieving SDG 7 is intrinsically linked to the well-being and empowerment of older persons. Affordable and clean energy can significantly improve living conditions and enhance the quality of life for this demographic. For instance, the availability of clean cooking solutions can mitigate the harmful effects of indoor air pollution, which is a leading cause of respiratory diseases and premature deaths among older adults, particularly in developing nations (WHO, 2021).

Moreover, reliable access to electricity can facilitate the adoption of assistive technologies and remote healthcare services, enhancing the independence and autonomy of older persons while reducing the burden on caregivers. Innovative energy solutions, such as decentralized renewable energy systems, can also foster income-generating opportunities for older entrepreneurs, contributing to their economic empowerment and social inclusion.

However, the pursuit of SDG 7 must be guided by a nuanced understanding of the diverse needs and challenges faced by older persons across different contexts. In many developing countries, the lack of access to modern energy services is compounded by limited infrastructure, financial constraints, and institutional barriers. Addressing these systemic challenges requires a concerted effort from governments, international organizations, and the private sector to develop inclusive and context-specific energy policies and programs.

Furthermore, the transition towards clean energy sources must be inclusive and just, ensuring that the benefits are equitably distributed and that marginalized communities, including older persons, are not left behind. This necessitates a focus on capacity-building, community engagement, and the integration of age-sensitive approaches in energy planning and implementation.

Innovative financing mechanisms, such as public-private partnerships and climate finance instruments, can play a crucial role in mobilizing resources and incentivizing investment in clean energy solutions tailored to the needs of older persons. For instance, the development of decentralized renewable energy systems in remote areas can not only provide reliable energy access but also create opportunities for older persons to participate in the local energy economy, fostering their economic empowerment and social inclusion.

Moreover, the promotion of energy efficiency and conservation measures, such as the adoption of energy-efficient appliances and retrofitting of buildings, can significantly reduce energy costs for older persons, alleviating the burden of energy poverty and enhancing their financial resilience.

Ultimately, achieving SDG 7 in a manner that benefits older persons requires a holistic and inclusive approach that recognizes the complex interplay between energy access, aging, and sustainable development. By prioritizing the unique needs and perspectives of older persons, and by fostering cross-sectoral collaboration and innovative partnerships, we can unlock the transformative potential of affordable and clean energy in creating a more equitable, sustainable, and age-friendly world.
