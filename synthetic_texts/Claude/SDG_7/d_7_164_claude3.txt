Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) as if written by advice columnist Carolyn Hax:

The Road to Energy Justice is Paved with Tough Choices 

Energy poverty is one of the cruelest forms of deprivation. When you lack reliable access to electricity and clean cooking fuels, it imposes severe constraints on nearly every aspect of life. Study becomes difficult after sundown. Nutritious foods spoil without refrigeration. Burning wood, dung or charcoal for heat and cooking produces noxious indoor air pollution that damages lungs. Economic opportunities remain limited without modern energy services. 

In short, energy poverty is a dream killer. Which makes SDG 7 — ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030 — one of the most critical objectives in the entire 2030 Agenda.

The scale of the challenge is immense. An estimated 759 million people lack access to electricity worldwide, with 75% living in sub-Saharan Africa. Nearly 2.6 billion people still rely primarily on polluting fuels and technologies for cooking, causing an estimated 3.8 million premature deaths each year from household air pollution.

Achieving universal energy access will require unprecedented global efforts and investments. The International Energy Agency estimates it will cost around $35 billion per year until 2030 to provide electricity and clean cooking access for all — roughly 3.6% of anticipated global energy investment needs over that period.

Mobilizing those investments is a monumental task, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic strained already constrained public finances. Innovative financing models that engage both public and private sector players will be crucial. So too will improving energy efficiency to reduce costs.

But energy access alone is not enough. We must also radically transform how we produce and use energy to address the climate crisis. The energy sector accounts for around 73% of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. If we fail to rapidly decarbonize energy systems, escalating climate impacts will devastate lives and livelihoods globally — disproportionately affecting the world's most vulnerable populations.

This sets up an excruciating trilemma. We need affordable energy for development. We need reliable energy for energy security. And we need sustainable energy for environmental protection. Finding policy pathways that balance all three priorities is perplexingly difficult.

Take electrification efforts in sub-Saharan Africa. Extending centralized electricity grids is expensive and time-consuming, so many nations have pursued decentralized renewable solutions like solar home systems and mini-grids. This expands energy access rapidly but at relatively high costs that strain household budgets. It also often relies on fossil fuel backup to ensure reliable power. How do we weigh affordability, reliability, and sustainability?

Or consider India, where hundreds of millions gained access to cleaner cooking through subsidized LPG distribution — until rising prices made refills unaffordable for the poor, forcing many back to dirty solid fuels. Was a temporary clean cooking solution worth the investment if it proved unsustainable?  

Perhaps most vexing are debates around which energy technologies to embrace. Hydropower is renewable but environmentally destructive at scale. Nuclear power is emissions-free but radioactive and proliferation-risky. Fossil fuels with carbon capture may allow continued use, but at what economic and reliability costs? Renewables like wind and solar are clean but intermittent.

Every option involves uncomfortable trade-offs on the energy trilemma. There are no easy answers — only imperfect choices shaped by messy political economies and context-specific constraints. Countries will prudently chart different courses based on their unique situations.

Yet the overarching imperative is clear. We need a general rebalancing of global energy investment toward emissions-free sources like renewables and next-generation nuclear power, while actively managing systemic risks. We need aggressive efforts on energy efficiency. And we desperately need technological breakthroughs to enable low-cost, reliable, clean energy at scale.

Above all, we need equity and justice to be front and center. Climate change has inhumane distributional consequences, imposing disproportionate costs on poorer nations least responsible for emissions. Any viable path forward must provide universal energy access while shielding vulnerable communities from bearing the brunt of mitigation efforts and adaptation needs. Ethics and rights must drive decision-making.

Forging an equitable global energy transition will test the limits of our collective resolve. It demands profound cooperation between nations at vastly divergent development levels. It hinges on wealthy countries mustering the moral courage to take the lead in decarbonization while mobilizing resources to empower poorer nations to leapfrog dirty energy pathways.  

It will be expensive and disruptive. Hard choices and uncertain outcomes lie ahead. Some will inevitably be dissatisfied with the trade-offs required.

Yet the costs of continued inertia and injustice compound by the day. Consigning billions to deprivation while existentially threatening humanity's future on a overheating planet cannot persist. We have no choice but to chart a more ethical, sustainable energy trajectory.

Our children and grandchildren deserve the opportunity to dream — unburdened by the indignities of energy poverty or imperiled by a climate unraveling. Fulfilling SDG 7's promise of affordable, reliable, sustainable energy for all gives them a chance. It's an imperfect solution to an impossible problem — but at this point, it's the only responsible path forward.
