Mennonite Central Committee (MCC), a faith-based relief and development organization, has been at the forefront of promoting sustainable energy solutions that align with Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) â€“ Affordable and Clean Energy. Our approach is rooted in the belief that access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services is a fundamental human right and a catalyst for sustainable development.

MCC recognizes the multifaceted challenges posed by energy poverty, particularly in rural communities of the Global South. In these regions, the lack of access to clean energy exacerbates poverty, hinders economic growth, and perpetuates gender inequalities. Women and children bear a disproportionate burden, spending countless hours collecting firewood and inhaling harmful indoor air pollution from traditional cookstoves.

To address these challenges, MCC has adopted a comprehensive strategy that integrates renewable energy solutions, capacity building, and community empowerment. Our initiatives encompass a range of technologies, including solar photovoltaic systems, improved cookstoves, biogas digesters, and micro-hydropower installations.

In rural communities of Sub-Saharan Africa, MCC has partnered with local organizations to establish solar-powered mini-grids, providing reliable and affordable electricity to households, schools, and healthcare facilities. These initiatives have not only improved access to essential services but have also stimulated economic opportunities through the establishment of small businesses and the adoption of productive use applications, such as solar water pumping for irrigation.

In South Asia, MCC's efforts have focused on the dissemination of improved cookstoves and biogas digesters, reducing household air pollution and mitigating deforestation. These initiatives have had a profound impact on women's health and empowerment, freeing up time previously spent on fuel collection and enabling income-generating activities.

MCC's approach extends beyond technology transfer; it emphasizes capacity building and community ownership. We collaborate with local partners to train technicians, establish maintenance and repair services, and promote energy cooperatives. This ensures the long-term sustainability of our initiatives and fosters community resilience.

Furthermore, MCC recognizes the importance of integrating energy access with other development sectors, such as agriculture, education, and healthcare. Our initiatives often encompass holistic approaches, such as the construction of solar-powered schools and healthcare facilities, or the integration of renewable energy systems with agricultural productivity enhancements.

MCC's commitment to SDG 7 is deeply rooted in our belief in the inherent dignity of every human being and our call to steward God's creation responsibly. We advocate for policies that promote energy access and renewable energy deployment, recognizing the existential threat posed by climate change and the urgent need for a just energy transition.

As we look ahead, MCC remains steadfast in our pursuit of sustainable energy solutions that empower communities and protect the environment. We will continue to forge partnerships, leverage innovative technologies, and amplify the voices of those most affected by energy poverty. Our vision is a world where every individual has access to affordable, reliable, and clean energy, enabling them to live with dignity, pursue economic opportunities, and contribute to a sustainable future.
