Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), written from the perspective of the political cartoonist and columnist Ted Rall:

Ensuring Access to Affordable, Reliable, Sustainable and Modern Energy for All: A Biting Satire 

By Ted Rall

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 7 calls for ensuring "access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all" by 2030. A noble aspiration to be sure, but one that reeks of detached elitism and myopic privilege when you stop to consider the grim reality facing billions across the developing world.  

Let's start with the basics - what exactly do the U.N. bureaucrats mean by "affordable" energy? For women in rural sub-Saharan Africa, subsisting on a few dollars a day, is there such a thing? These are regions where families routinely sacrifice meals to pay usurious prices charged by energy cartels granted regional monopolies by corrupt governments. To afford electricity, if the grid even reaches their village, destitute households are often forced into crippling debt and indentured servitude. But I'm sure those inspiring words about "affordable energy" offer them great comfort as they huddle around a smoky cooking fire after another 18-hour day of backbreaking labor.

As for "reliable" energy, that's simply laughable for vast swaths of the world's population. War-torn nations see energy infrastructure targeted in conflicts by both state and non-state actors seeking to control resources and supply chains. Even in relatively stable developing countries, fraud, incompetence and graft render electrical grids a redundant facade - with power routinely cut to entire cities to prevent overloads or siphon electricity to ruling parties and oligarchs. For hundreds of millions, reliable electricity is but a distant fantasy. 

The "[email protected]" in SDG 7 exposes the bourgeois mindset of this feel-good development agenda. Here you have communities poisoned by the smoke and particulate byproducts of burning wood, dung and charcoal for heat and light. Environments choked by soot, carcinogens and greenhouse gases. But the institutional authors of these platitudinous goals have the temerity to deride these "unclean" energy sources despite their being the only viable options for energy-starved populations. This paternalistic language drips with the same ethnocentric arrogance that enabled centuries of colonial oppression and environmental despoilment of the Global South in the first place. 

And finally, the crown jewel: "modern energy for all." For context, over 3 billion people globally still lack access to reliable, modern energy services. That's a breathtaking statistic that should shake anyone's conscience. Yet here we have dilettantes in plush Geneva conference rooms pontificating vaguely about some nebulous "modern energy" for the disadvantaged masses they've likely never interacted with outside the confines of a velvet-roped photo op or tightly-controlled "cultural immersion" tour.

Make no mistake, SDG 7 is the quintessence of facile, privileged ideation untethered from the complex realities that entrap the world's dispossessed in cyclical, inter-generational energy poverty. The devil, as they say, is in the details - or in this case, the utter lack thereof. There are no clear implementation roadmaps, binding international accountability measures, or concrete financing mechanisms articulated to enable such a transformative global energy transition.  

So before lecturing developing nations on the virtues of "modern energy," the high priests of sustainable development would be wise to take a long look in the mirror. The energy portfolios of wealthy nations continue to be overwhelmingly derived from climate-ravaging fossil fuels, nuclear power and other environmentally destructive sources. Upwards of a billion people in the West still burn wood and fossil fuels for heating and cooking. And the unchecked profligacy, overconsumption and planned obsolescence ingrained in modern consumerist societies represents perhaps the greatest threat to achieving sustainability at scale.

In summary, SDG 7 epitomizes the yawning chasm between lofty U.N. rhetoric about "sustainable energy for all" and the harsh realities confronting the world's deprived populations. It's yet another example of armchair philosophers mistaking aspiration for pragmatic strategy - while billions continue to choke on smoke and societal immobility in energy-starved poverty traps. Tear away the sanctimonious drivel about "affordable," "reliable," and "sustainable" energy and what you're left with is little more than a vapid platitude designed to assauge the guilt of the powerful rather than unleash the potential of the powerless. But I suppose that's par for the course when it comes to the United Nations' spiritual bamboozlement.
