Affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all – this is what the United Nations had in mind when they outlined the 7th Sustainable Development Goal. As someone who has spent years writing novels that resonate with the hopes, struggles, and aspirations of India's youth, I can't help but view this goal through the lens of our nation's energy challenges.

Energy poverty is a harsh reality for millions in our country. I've met families in rural areas who rely on smoky kerosene lamps and rudimentary biomass cookstoves –hazardous sources that impair their health and limit productivity. For our urban poor, erratic electricity supply and unaffordable prices mean living in dilapidated, sweltering tenements without fans or lights. It's a delicate dance of trade-offs between cooling discomfort and escalating power bills.

This lack of access to clean, affordable energy isn't just an inconvenience; it's a multi-generational trap that stymies socioeconomic progress. How can a child study properly by the flicker of a dim lantern? How does a woman pursue income opportunities when most waking hours are spent gathering firewood? Energy deprivation is both a driver and symptom of multidimensional poverty.

But the SDG 7 narrative extends far beyond alleviating energy poverty. Transitioning to renewable sources like solar, wind and hydropower is crucial for mitigating climate change and its devastating consequences. The science is unequivocal – our reliance on fossil fuels is disrupting Earth's climate patterns, putting coastal cities like Mumbai at risk of inundation, jeopardizing farm yields that feed millions, and intensifying extreme weather events.

Renewable energy must be our nation's energy future; not just because it's cleaner and sustainable, but also due to its immense potential for generating employment, particularly for our youth. India's solar power targets of achieving 100 GW by 2022 will create thousands of job opportunities across the value chain – from module manufacturing to installation and maintenance of photovoltaic systems. This is a strategic intersection where India's renewable energy ambitions can help address the burgeoning youth employment crisis.

Of course, the path to a secure, sustainable energy future isn't without its hurdles. Inadequate investment in grid infrastructure, financially-unviable electricity pricing, entrenched fossil fuel subsidies – these are formidable roadblocks we must overcome. But Indians are no strangers to daunting challenges. We are a nation that achieved the seemingly impossible feat of successfully implementing the world's largest electrification drive, connecting over 26 million households to the power grid in an audaciously short timeframe.

With that same 'can-do' spirit coupled with policy foresight and public-private collaboration, I am confident we can realize the dream of SDG 7. A dream where all Indians, regardless of income or geography, have access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services. Where our burgeoning cities reduce their carbon footprint by harnessing renewable power while empowering rural communities through decentralized clean energy solutions. Where the energy sector generates not just electrons, but also jobs, entrepreneurial opportunities and sustainable development co-benefits.

It's an ambitious vision, but one that is eminently achievable. Because if the incredible India story has taught us anything, it is that this nation of over a billion people can manifest the untamed power of human determination to move mountains. What's energy transition in the face of that?
