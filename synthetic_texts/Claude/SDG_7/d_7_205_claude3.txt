Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), written from the perspective of the late economist Walter E. Williams:

The seventh Sustainable Development Goal set forth by the United Nations calls for "ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all" by the year 2030. As an economist, I must scrutinize such lofty aims through the lens of incentives, resource constraints, and opportunity costs.  

Energy is the lifeblood of economic growth and development. However, the world's heavy reliance on relatively inexpensive fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas has come at a steep environmental price. The combustion of these energy sources releases greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming and climate change, threatening ecological disaster. This represents a glaring negative externality not properly accounted for in pricing mechanisms. 

The UN's push for renewable, low-emission energy sources appears well-intentioned on its face. However, we must weigh the benefits against the costs and tradeoffs required. While solar, wind, geothermal and other "clean" technologies have become more efficient in recent decades, they remain significantly more expensive than fossil fuels in most applications, hindering their widespread adoption.

Economies powered chiefly by costly intermittent sources like solar and wind would likely operate at substantially reduced levels of productivity. This would diminish economic output, retard economic progress, and leave billions worsened in the very poverty the UN aims to alleviate. It risks turning affordable energy into a reserve for only the affluent elite.

Furthermore, the nuclear option—one of the cleanest, most potent and viable alternative energy sources—is effectively regulated into oblivion in most nations out of exaggerated fears, making a truly pragmatic energy transition untenable. The same environmental alarmists claiming climate cataclysms from carbon emissions curiously ignore nuclear's amazing safety record and minuscule environmental impact.

There are also concerns about economic freedom, property rights, and the encroachment of big government that must be weighed. Top-down, command-and-control regimes mandating energy policy are more prone to inefficiency, waste, and rent-seeking than allowing consumer preferences to govern in free markets.

I hold no rosy delusion that existing fossil fuel usage can be allowed to continue unabated. Incentive-based measures like revenue-neutral carbon taxes paired with income tax reductions could spur profit-motivated firms to prioritize cleaner energy innovations organically. But mandating renewable energy benchmarks risks stifling economic vitality while raising energy costs precipitously for the world's poor majority.

We must approach sustainable energy aims through the lens of hard-nosed realism and cost/benefit analysis, not utopianism and outsized emissions alarmism. I fear the UN's SDG 7 agenda, however well-intentioned, suffers from economic naiveté about the drawbacks of artificially distorting energy markets and the unintended consequences of heavy-handed policies. A more pragmatic, decentralized approach respecting economic incentives and tradeoffs may better serve the dual interests of environmental stewardship and human flourishing.
