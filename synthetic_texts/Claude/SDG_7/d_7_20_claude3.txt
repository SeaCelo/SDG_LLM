Ensuring universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services has been a longstanding challenge, particularly in middle-income countries grappling with rapid urbanization, industrialization, and population growth. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has been at the forefront of efforts to accelerate progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7), which aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all by 2030.

In many middle-income nations, a significant portion of the population still lacks access to electricity, relying on traditional biomass fuels such as firewood, charcoal, and animal waste for cooking and heating. This not only perpetuates energy poverty but also contributes to indoor air pollution, respiratory diseases, and environmental degradation. Addressing this issue requires a multi-pronged approach that combines grid extension, decentralized renewable energy solutions, and improved cookstove technologies.

The UNDP has been actively supporting middle-income countries in their transition towards sustainable energy systems. One notable initiative is the Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) programme, which aims to catalyze investment, build enabling policy environments, and foster private-sector engagement in energy access initiatives. Through this programme, the UNDP has facilitated the deployment of off-grid solar home systems, mini-grids, and clean cookstoves in remote and underserved communities, providing affordable and clean energy solutions.

Additionally, the UNDP has been instrumental in promoting the adoption of renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, and hydropower, in middle-income countries. By supporting the development of renewable energy policies, regulatory frameworks, and financing mechanisms, the UNDP has helped to create an enabling environment for private sector investment and participation in the renewable energy sector.

One example of the UNDP's work in this area is the Derisking Renewable Energy Investment (DREI) initiative, which aims to address specific risk categories that hinder private sector investment in renewable energy projects. Through this initiative, the UNDP has provided technical assistance, capacity building, and financial de-risking instruments to support the development of renewable energy projects in middle-income countries.

Furthermore, the UNDP has been actively engaged in promoting energy efficiency measures across various sectors, including buildings, industry, and transportation. By supporting the development and implementation of energy efficiency policies, standards, and incentive schemes, the UNDP has helped middle-income countries to reduce energy consumption, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and achieve cost savings.

In the context of middle-income countries, the UNDP has also recognized the importance of addressing the nexus between energy, poverty, and gender equality. Women and girls in these countries often bear the disproportionate burden of collecting biomass fuels and are exposed to the health risks associated with indoor air pollution. The UNDP has implemented gender-responsive energy initiatives that empower women as energy entrepreneurs, decision-makers, and beneficiaries of modern energy services.

Despite significant progress, challenges remain in achieving SDG 7 in middle-income countries. Limited financial resources, inadequate regulatory frameworks, and institutional capacity constraints continue to hinder the scaling up of sustainable energy solutions. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated energy poverty and hindered progress towards achieving SDG 7 targets.

To address these challenges, the UNDP has advocated for increased international cooperation, innovative financing mechanisms, and the integration of sustainable energy solutions into broader development strategies. By leveraging partnerships with governments, the private sector, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders, the UNDP is working to accelerate the transition towards sustainable energy systems that are accessible, affordable, and environmentally sustainable.
