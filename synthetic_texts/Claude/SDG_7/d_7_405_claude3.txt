As a leading organization dedicated to advocating for and supporting victims of torture, the Center for Victims of Torture recognizes the critical role that access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy plays in preventing and mitigating the conditions that enable human rights violations. Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7), which aims to "ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all," holds profound implications for the global fight against torture and the promotion of human dignity.

The lack of access to modern energy services perpetuates cycles of poverty, conflict, and human rights abuses, creating fertile ground for the practice of torture. In many regions plagued by energy poverty, vulnerable populations are forced to rely on hazardous and inefficient energy sources, such as kerosene lamps and traditional biomass cookstoves, which pose significant health risks and environmental damage. The arduous task of collecting fuel, often undertaken by women and children, exposes them to increased risk of gender-based violence, exploitation, and human trafficking.

Moreover, energy-deprived communities struggle to meet basic needs, including access to healthcare, education, and economic opportunities, amplifying societal tensions and fueling conflicts that can lead to the systematic use of torture as a means of repression, control, and intimidation. The Center for Victims of Torture has witnessed firsthand the devastating impact of these interrelated factors on individuals and communities, underscoring the urgency of addressing energy poverty as a critical component of our mission.

Conversely, achieving universal access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy can serve as a powerful catalyst for human rights protection and the prevention of torture. Clean energy solutions, such as solar, wind, and hydropower, not only mitigate the adverse environmental and health impacts associated with traditional energy sources but also promote economic development, education, and gender equality – all crucial factors in fostering stable, resilient, and just societies.

By empowering communities with access to modern energy services, SDG 7 has the potential to create a virtuous cycle of empowerment, enabling individuals and communities to escape the grip of poverty, conflict, and human rights violations. Furthermore, the transition to renewable energy sources can contribute to mitigating the impacts of climate change, which exacerbates resource scarcity, displacement, and conflict – all drivers of human rights abuses and torture.

In our pursuit of a world free from torture, the Center for Victims of Torture recognizes the vital importance of addressing the underlying socioeconomic and environmental factors that fuel human rights violations. SDG 7 represents a critical opportunity to address energy poverty as a root cause of conflict, instability, and human suffering, while simultaneously promoting sustainable development, environmental protection, and the advancement of human rights.

Through strategic partnerships, advocacy, and capacity-building initiatives, the Center for Victims of Torture is committed to leveraging the transformative potential of SDG 7 to empower vulnerable communities, enhance resilience, and create an enabling environment for the protection of human rights and the prevention of torture. By integrating energy access into our holistic approach, we can catalyze positive change and contribute to the realization of a world where human dignity is upheld, and the scourge of torture is eradicated for good.
