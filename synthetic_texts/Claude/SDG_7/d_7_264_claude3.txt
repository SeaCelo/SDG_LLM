Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 7 on affordable and clean energy, written from the perspective of economist N. Gregory Mankiw:

The achievement of affordable and clean energy access for all, as outlined in the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 7, represents one of the most crucial challenges facing the global economy in the 21st century. As gains from economic growth have been inequitably distributed across regions and income groups, the lack of reliable and environmentally sustainable energy access has emerged as both a cause and consequence of persistent poverty traps.  

From a purely economic standpoint, affordable energy functions as a vital input to production processes across sectors. Its absence inhibits economic diversification, employment opportunities, and value creation - a reality that perpetuates intergenerational poverty in many parts of the developing world. However, conventional energy systems have imposed severe externalities in the form of ecological degradation, biodiversity loss, and greenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change. Thus, the dual objectives of Goal 7 force policymakers to confront an intricate dilemma at the intersection of economic efficiency and environmental sustainability.

The crux of this challenge lies in resolving the market failures endemic to energy markets worldwide. The divergence between private and social costs of fossil fuel combustion, compounded by geopolitical distortions in global oil and gas markets, have systematically underpriced conventional energy while neglecting more sustainable alternatives. As a result, the marginal private benefits of clean energy investments have been insufficient to catalyze the requisite technological innovation and uptake.

Pigovian taxes on carbon emissions have been championed by many economists as a potential panacea to correct this market failure. By internalizing the social costs of pollution into private optimization problems, such measures could theoretically incentivize a socially optimal transition towards renewable energy sources. However, the regressive distributional impacts of such policies present a formidable political economy constraint in the absence of comprehensive compensation mechanisms for disproportionately affected communities.

An alternative approach has emerged through direct subsidization and institutional support for clean energy research and development. By de-risking innovation and creating niche markets for sustainable technologies, public funding could drive their accelerated cost declines – emulating the dynamism exemplified by modern computing and telecommunications. Nonetheless, such interventions are susceptible to regulatory capture, rent-seeking behavior, and suboptimal allocation of resources in the absence of robust governance frameworks.

Ultimately, the most pragmatic policy paradigm may necessitate a complementary bundle of targeted measures tailored to distinct national circumstances. Developed economies could leverage carbon pricing and ecological fiscal transfers to steer consumption towards sustainability. Simultaneously, capacity-building initiatives, catalytic public investments, and technology transfers could pave the runway for clean energy deployment across the developing world.  

In tandem with such policies, mobilizing the requisite scale of financing remains an overarching bottleneck – with recent estimates suggesting an annual investment gap of over $1 trillion to attain universal modern energy access by 2030. Catalyzing private capital through de-risking instruments, securitization mechanisms, and pipeline development will be pivotal in bridging this divide. Simultaneously, concessional lending and grants from multilateral institutions must be strategically directed towards the most financially-constrained yet impactful interventions.

In addressing the multifaceted challenges embedded within Goal 7, policymakers must approach the issue not merely as an environmental imperative, but as a prerequisite for inclusive and sustainable economic development worldwide. Though the path ahead remains arduous, the catalytic benefits of achieving this goal could profoundly elevate human welfare whilst mitigating one of the gravest existential risks confronting humanity. The onus, therefore, is upon the global community to muster the requisite resources and political will to realize this transformative vision over the coming decades.
