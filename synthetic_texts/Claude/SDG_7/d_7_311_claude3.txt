The Belgian Policy Plan for Development Cooperation recognizes the critical importance of Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7), which aims to "ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all." This ambitious goal is a cornerstone of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, as energy underpins nearly every aspect of modern society, from economic growth and industrialization to healthcare, education, and environmental sustainability.

Belgium's commitment to SDG 7 is multifaceted, reflecting the complex challenges and opportunities associated with the global energy transition. One of the primary focus areas is promoting access to affordable and clean energy in developing countries, where energy poverty remains a significant barrier to human development. According to the International Energy Agency, nearly 800 million people worldwide lack access to electricity, and over 2.6 billion rely on traditional biomass, such as wood, charcoal, and animal waste, for cooking and heating. This reliance on polluting and inefficient energy sources has severe consequences for human health, environmental degradation, and economic productivity.

To address this issue, Belgium is supporting initiatives that prioritize the deployment of renewable energy technologies, particularly in rural and remote areas. This includes investments in off-grid solar solutions, small-scale hydropower projects, and sustainable bioenergy systems. By leveraging innovative financing mechanisms, such as public-private partnerships and result-based financing, Belgium aims to catalyze private sector investment and accelerate the adoption of clean energy solutions.

Moreover, Belgium recognizes the critical role of energy efficiency in achieving SDG 7. Improving energy efficiency not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions and mitigates the impact of climate change but also enhances energy security, lowers energy costs for households and businesses, and creates employment opportunities in the green economy. Belgium is actively supporting capacity-building programs and technology transfer initiatives to promote energy-efficient practices and technologies in partner countries.

Another key area of focus for Belgium is the integration of energy access and sustainability into broader development strategies. Access to modern energy services is a prerequisite for achieving many other SDGs, including those related to poverty eradication, food security, health, education, and gender equality. By mainstreaming energy considerations into its development cooperation programs, Belgium aims to ensure a holistic and coordinated approach to sustainable development.

Furthermore, Belgium acknowledges the importance of addressing the environmental and social impacts of energy systems. The transition to sustainable energy must be carried out in a responsible and inclusive manner, minimizing negative impacts on local communities and ecosystems. This includes promoting the principles of the circular economy, ensuring the responsible management of energy resources, and engaging with stakeholders, including indigenous communities, to ensure their rights and interests are respected.

In line with its commitment to SDG 7, Belgium is actively engaged in international cooperation and knowledge-sharing initiatives. Through multilateral platforms, such as the United Nations and the European Union, Belgium contributes to the development of global energy policies, strategies, and best practices. Additionally, Belgium supports research and innovation programs that aim to advance sustainable energy technologies, business models, and policies, fostering collaboration between academic institutions, research organizations, and the private sector.

Achieving SDG 7 by 2030 requires a concerted effort from all stakeholders, including governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector. Belgium recognizes the urgency of this challenge and remains committed to playing a proactive role in the global energy transition, contributing to a sustainable, equitable, and prosperous future for all.
