Ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030 is a critical imperative not just for the developing world, but for the prosperity and security of nations across the globe. As Chief of Staff to former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, I witnessed firsthand the challenges of balancing energy needs with environmental concerns and long-term sustainability.

Australia is blessed with abundant natural resources, including coal, gas, and uranium reserves that have fueled our economic engine for decades. However, our reliance on fossil fuels has come at a cost – increased greenhouse gas emissions, environmental degradation, and vulnerability to global energy shocks. The transition to a low-carbon economy is not just an environmental imperative but an economic and strategic necessity.

The Paris Agreement's commitment to limit global temperature rise to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels has set the stage for a global energy transformation. However, the path forward is fraught with challenges, particularly for resource-rich nations like Australia.

On one hand, we must leverage our natural endowments to ensure energy security and affordability for households and businesses. Our coal and gas exports have underpinned our economic prosperity and trade relationships with key partners in the Asia-Pacific region. Any abrupt abandonment of these industries would have severe consequences for jobs, investment, and our international competitiveness.

On the other hand, we cannot ignore the existential threat posed by climate change and the urgency of decarbonizing our energy systems. The costs of inaction – from rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and biodiversity loss – far outweigh the short-term economic gains of clinging to fossil fuels.

The solution lies in a pragmatic, technology-driven approach that harnesses our innovative spirit and entrepreneurial zeal. Australia is well-positioned to become a global leader in renewable energy technologies, such as solar, wind, and hydrogen. Our vast landmass, ample sunshine, and skilled workforce provide a fertile ground for the development and deployment of these clean energy sources.

Moreover, our expertise in carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies can play a vital role in mitigating emissions from our existing fossil fuel industries, ensuring a just transition for workers and communities reliant on these sectors.

Achieving SDG 7 will require a multi-faceted strategy that addresses energy access, efficiency, and sustainability. In remote and rural communities, decentralized renewable energy solutions, such as solar home systems and mini-grids, can provide reliable and affordable electricity, reducing dependence on polluting diesel generators.

In urban areas, energy efficiency measures in buildings, transportation, and industry can significantly reduce energy demand and associated emissions. Smart grid technologies, demand-side management, and energy storage solutions can optimize energy use and integrate intermittent renewable sources into the grid.

However, the true potential of SDG 7 extends beyond domestic boundaries. As a global energy superpower, Australia has the opportunity to leverage its resources and expertise to drive sustainable energy development in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond.

By investing in renewable energy projects, sharing best practices in energy efficiency, and collaborating on research and development initiatives, we can foster regional cooperation and contribute to global efforts to combat climate change.

Moreover, the development of green hydrogen exports can position Australia as a leader in the emerging global hydrogen economy, creating new export opportunities and strengthening our ties with key trading partners.

Achieving SDG 7 will require a concerted effort from all stakeholders – government, industry, civil society, and individuals. It will demand bold policy decisions, sustained investment in research and development, and a willingness to embrace new technologies and business models.

Critics may argue that the transition to sustainable energy will come at too high a cost, jeopardizing economic growth and job creation. However, the reality is that the costs of inaction far outweigh the costs of adaptation. The global energy transformation presents immense economic opportunities for those willing to embrace innovation and lead the way.

As a nation built on the resilience and ingenuity of its people, Australia is well-equipped to navigate this transition. By harnessing our natural resources, technological prowess, and entrepreneurial spirit, we can secure our energy future while safeguarding our environment and ensuring a prosperous, sustainable future for generations to come.
