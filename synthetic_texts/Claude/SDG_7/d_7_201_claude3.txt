Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 7 - Affordable and Clean Energy, written from the perspective of Cal Thomas, the conservative political commentator:

The push for "affordable and clean energy" under the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 7 is a prime example of the dangers of centralized, top-down control over issues that should be left to the free market and individual liberty. The very premise that access to energy is some sort of fundamental human right that must be guaranteed by governments and NGOs reeks of the bureaucratic overreach and creeping socialism that has become all too prevalent in today's political discourse.

At its core, SDG 7 represents a misguided attempt to reshape the global energy landscape through artificial constraints and regressive policies. The utopian vision of universal energy access by 2030, centered around low-carbon sources like wind and solar, may sound noble in theory. But the real-world impacts would be disastrous for energy affordability, reliability, and economic vitality - the very things this goal claims to promote.

History has shown time and again that top-down diktats from centralized authorities stifle innovation, efficiency, and consumer choice. The unprecedented increase in global living standards over the past two centuries was made possible not by bureaucratic edicts, but by free people harnessing the power of fossil fuels in an open market system. Coal, oil and natural gas powered the Industrial Revolution and lifted billions out of abject poverty. To now declare these abundant, affordable energy sources as unacceptable based on unproven climate change theory is shockingly arrogant and ahistorical.

Rather than doubling down on policies that make energy more expensive and scarce, the true path to universal energy access lies in liberating markets, protecting property rights, and empowering the world's poor through economic freedom. The widespread adoption of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, for instance, unlocked a bonanza of inexpensive natural gas that dramatically lowered emissions while providing reliable power.  Innovation in modular nuclear reactors and next-generation battery storage could further expand energy access without carbon constraints if allowed to develop organically.

Instead, SDG 7 foolishly dismisses these market-based solutions in favor of a heavy-handed focus on taxpayer-subsidized renewable sources that remain unaffordable for the masses without government support. Wind turbines and solar panels require vast amounts of land, create toxic waste, kill scores of birds and bats, and fail to provide reliable baseload power. Their intermittent nature means they cannot power hospitals, factories or densely populated cities without fossil fuel backups. Forcing nations to rely more heavily on these suboptimal sources is a recipe for energy poverty, not abundance.

At the end of the day, SDG 7 reflects the arrogant conceit behind so much of the UN's social and environmental engineering agenda - the wrongheaded belief that unelected bureaucrats can somehow centrally plan and dictate "sustainable" policies better than the collective wisdom of free people making their own choices in free markets. True sustainability can only emerge organically from a system that respects private property rights, limits government overreach, and allows entrepreneurs the latitude to innovate solutions that meet society's ever-evolving needs and preferences. Sacrificing freedom and affordability on the polluted altar of "green energy" will only lead the world's most vulnerable down the path of energy deprivation.
