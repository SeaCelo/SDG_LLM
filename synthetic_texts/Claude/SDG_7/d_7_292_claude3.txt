Here is a draft academic article on SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy as if written by economist Lawrence J. Christiano:

Ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy is essential for achieving many of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals and providing a pathway out of poverty for billions around the world. Currently, around 760 million people lack access to electricity and nearly 3 billion rely on polluting fuels like wood or charcoal for cooking and heating. This energy poverty severely constrains economic opportunities, disrupts education, threatens health through indoor air pollution, and entrenches inequality. At the same time, the world's reliance on fossil fuels for energy generation is a leading contributor to climate change, with devastating environmental and socioeconomic ramifications.

The transition to clean energy sources is thus a dual imperative - providing universal access to modern energy services while rapidly decarbonizing the global energy mix. However, this transition faces immense challenges of affordability, scalability, intermittency of renewable sources, energy storage limitations, grid infrastructure deficiencies, and vested fossil fuel interests. Tackling these will require a holistic approach spanning technological innovation, financing, market design, and international coordination.

On the supply side, accelerated deployment of mature renewable technologies like solar, wind, hydro, geothermal and modern bioenergy is crucial. But their variable output necessitates complementary solutions - batteries, green hydrogen, carbon capture for gas plants, nuclear safeguarded by new safety protocols, among others. Smart grids, distributed energy systems, and energy efficiency will be vital on the demand side, undergirded by carbon pricing, fossil fuel subsidy reform, and integration of renewable energy into competitive wholesale power markets.

Achieving universal energy access hinges on innovative financing and service delivery models suited to low-income communities like pay-as-you-go off-grid solar solutions and micro-grids. But ultimately significant public investment is imperative given the scale of energy poverty. A proposed global fund for energy access akin to the GAVI vaccine alliance could help mobilize resources and ensure aid effectiveness.

Of course, any prescriptions must be contextual given divergent resource endowments, existing energy mix, income levels, and policy environments across countries. The energy transition in China - now leading in renewable investment despite coal dominance - will necessarily differ from strategies for low-income countries or OECD nations. Regional integration of energy markets and supply chains can enhance energy security and smooth renewable energy flows between nations with complementary conditions.

Critically, a just transition ensuring affordable energy and green employment opportunities for all is paramount to prevent exacerbating inequality or precipitating social unrest. The energy transformation should be designed to include provisions for reskilling displaced workers, targeted social protection, and community renewal in regions reliant on conventional fuels.

In the end, achieving SDG 7 is both an urgent existential imperative and an immense opportunity to accelerate sustainable development through reliable, clean power. It will require unprecedented international cooperation to galvanize financing, governing mechanisms to incentivize private investment, equitable burden-sharing, and ambitious yet pragmatic policies tailored to countries' circumstances. But the payoffs would be generational - slashing energy poverty, averting climate catastrophe, creating millions of green jobs, igniting economic growth through enhanced productivity, and improving health and education outcomes worldwide. The transition may be daunting but the costs of inaction are even higher. We must treat clean energy provision as the preeminent development priority of our time.
