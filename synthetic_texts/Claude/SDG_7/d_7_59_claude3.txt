As a prominent economist and outspoken critic of the current policy paradigm, I find the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly Goal 7 on affordable and clean energy, to be a misguided and ineffective approach to addressing the world's energy challenges.

The notion that we can achieve universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services by 2030, while substantially increasing the share of renewable energy sources, is nothing short of a utopian fantasy. It betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of the realities of energy markets, technological constraints, and the economic trade-offs inherent in energy policy.

Let's start with the goal of universal energy access. While the intention is noble, the assumption that providing energy to the world's poorest communities will magically lift them out of poverty is misguided. Energy access is a byproduct of economic development, not a cause. Prioritizing energy access over economic growth and productivity improvements is akin to putting the cart before the horse.

Furthermore, the emphasis on renewable energy sources is driven more by ideological fervor than by sound economic reasoning. Renewable energy technologies, such as wind and solar, are inherently intermittent and unreliable, requiring expensive backup systems and grid infrastructure to maintain a stable energy supply. The true costs of these technologies, once you factor in the necessary storage solutions and grid upgrades, are often overlooked or downplayed by their proponents.

Moreover, the push for renewable energy has led to distortionary subsidies and mandates that undermine market forces and hamper the efficient allocation of resources. These policies have resulted in higher energy costs for consumers and businesses, eroding competitiveness and diverting resources away from more productive investments.

Instead of pursuing the quixotic goal of a rapid transition to renewable energy, we should focus on promoting a diverse energy mix that includes fossil fuels, nuclear power, and emerging technologies like hydrogen and carbon capture and storage. These energy sources offer reliable, affordable, and scalable solutions that can meet the world's growing energy demands while minimizing environmental impacts.

Proponents of the SDGs often point to the success of countries like Germany and Denmark in adopting renewable energy. However, these examples are misleading, as these nations have benefited from substantial subsidies and high energy prices paid by consumers and industries. This model is neither scalable nor desirable for developing economies, where affordable energy is a critical enabler of economic growth and poverty alleviation.

Furthermore, the fixation on renewable energy has led to a neglect of other critical energy challenges, such as improving energy efficiency, modernizing grid infrastructure, and promoting technological innovation. These areas offer significant opportunities for reducing energy consumption, improving reliability, and fostering sustainable economic growth.

In conclusion, while the intentions behind SDG 7 are well-meaning, the goal itself is misguided and fails to account for the complex trade-offs and realities of energy policy. Instead of pursuing unrealistic targets and ideologically driven agendas, we should adopt a pragmatic and market-oriented approach that promotes a diverse energy mix, fosters technological innovation, and prioritizes economic growth and productivity improvements. Only then can we truly achieve sustainable and affordable energy for all.
