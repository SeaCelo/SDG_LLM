Here is a draft academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), written from the perspective of economist Alan Auerbach:

The world's energy landscape is at a critical juncture. Rising global energy demand, persistent poverty and inequality, and the existential threat of climate change have brought the issues of affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy to the forefront of policy agendas. Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) – to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030 – is a vital target that lies at the nexus of economic development, energy security, and environmental preservation.

Achieving universal access to modern energy services is a fundamental enabler for alleviating poverty and catalyzing economic growth. Currently, nearly 800 million people lack access to electricity, and around 2.8 billion lack access to clean cooking solutions. The consequences of this energy poverty are stark – diminished economic opportunities, adverse health impacts from indoor air pollution, entrenched inequalities, and restricted human development. Extending affordable and reliable electricity access is thus a moral and economic imperative.

However, the pursuit of energy access cannot be divorced from sustainability considerations. The energy sector accounts for around two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions, a key driver of climate change. Unconstrained growth in fossil fuel consumption is environmentally disastrous and economically myopic, locking economies into carbon-intensive development pathways. A transition towards low-carbon, renewable energy solutions is an economic and ecological necessity.

Herein lies the central challenge of SDG 7 – balancing the expanding energy needs of a growing global population with rapidly decarbonizing energy systems to mitigate climate risks. Conventional policy approaches of subsidizing fossil fuels are misguided - not only are they fiscally costly and regressive, distorting energy markets and perpetuating carbon lock-in, but they also disproportionately benefit the relatively affluent. A more holistic and forward-looking approach is required.

Putting an appropriate price on carbon, through mechanisms like emissions trading schemes or carbon taxes, is a crucial first step. This creates market incentives for energy efficiency and renewables while incentivizing the private sector to innovate and develop low-carbon technologies. However, carbon pricing alone is insufficient – more carrot is needed alongside the stick. Targeted public investments to accelerate renewable energy deployment and facilitate technology transfers are vital, as is mobilizing climate finance flows to support developing countries' transitions. 

Moreover, we must recognize energy access and environmental sustainability as intrinsically linked. Distributed renewable energy solutions like solar home systems, micro-grids, and clean cookstoves can cost-effectively provide modern energy services while mitigating emissions and local pollution. These off-grid approaches can rapidly enhance energy access in remote areas while circumventing the need for costly grid extensions. Countries like Bangladesh have demonstrated impressive success in scaling up solar home systems through innovative financing models.

Ultimately, a holistic strategy centered on market-based mechanisms, public investments, international cooperation, and tailored local solutions will be crucial for attaining SDG 7. The economic case is clear – affordable and clean energy catalyzes economic productivity, fosters inclusiveness, enhances resilience, and avoids the catastrophic costs of climate inaction. What's needed is bold leadership and concerted global action to seize the opportunities of the ongoing energy transformation. Our economic and environmental futures depend on it.
