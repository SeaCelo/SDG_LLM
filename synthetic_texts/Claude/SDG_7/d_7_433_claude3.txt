The path towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) – ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all – is a multifaceted challenge that demands a comprehensive and innovative approach. As a leading global humanitarian organization, Mercy Corps recognizes the inextricable link between energy access and human development, and our efforts in this sphere are driven by a deep understanding of the complexities involved.

At the heart of our strategy lies a commitment to empowering communities through a bottom-up approach that prioritizes local context, cultural nuances, and participatory decision-making. We understand that energy solutions cannot be one-size-fits-all; instead, they must be tailored to the unique needs, resources, and aspirations of each community we serve.

One of the key pillars of our work is the promotion of decentralized renewable energy systems, particularly in remote and off-grid areas where traditional grid infrastructure is often lacking or unreliable. By leveraging the abundant solar, wind, and hydropower resources available in many of the regions we operate, we aim to establish sustainable and resilient energy systems that are both environmentally friendly and economically viable.

Our approach involves working closely with local stakeholders, including community leaders, women's groups, and youth organizations, to co-create energy solutions that align with their priorities and aspirations. We place a strong emphasis on capacity building, ensuring that communities have the knowledge and skills to operate, maintain, and even manufacture these renewable energy systems independently.

One notable example of our work is the solar microgrid initiative in rural Ethiopia, where we have partnered with local cooperatives to establish a network of community-owned and operated solar microgrids. These systems not only provide reliable electricity to households and businesses but also serve as anchor loads for productive use activities, such as water pumping for irrigation, milling, and small-scale manufacturing. By integrating these income-generating opportunities, we aim to create a self-sustaining cycle of energy access and economic empowerment.

Furthermore, our approach recognizes the critical role of energy efficiency in achieving SDG 7. We work with communities to promote energy-efficient practices and technologies, such as improved cookstoves, insulation materials, and energy-efficient appliances. These interventions not only reduce energy consumption and associated costs but also mitigate environmental impacts and improve indoor air quality, contributing to better health outcomes.

Underpinning our efforts is a strong emphasis on gender equality and social inclusion. We understand that energy access is not only a technological challenge but also a social and cultural one. By actively engaging women and marginalized groups in the design, implementation, and governance of energy projects, we aim to dismantle barriers and ensure that the benefits of energy access are equitably distributed.

Our work also extends beyond the immediate provision of energy services. We recognize the interconnectedness of the Sustainable Development Goals and strive to leverage energy access as a catalyst for achieving progress across multiple fronts. For instance, reliable and affordable energy can enhance educational opportunities by enabling students to study after dark, improve healthcare delivery through powering medical facilities, and support economic development by enabling productive activities and entrepreneurship.

To amplify our impact, we actively seek collaborations and partnerships with a diverse range of stakeholders, including governments, multilateral organizations, private sector entities, and research institutions. By leveraging their collective expertise, resources, and networks, we aim to drive innovation, scale up successful interventions, and influence policies and regulatory frameworks that promote sustainable energy access.

As we navigate the complexities of achieving SDG 7, we remain committed to a holistic and adaptive approach that continuously evolves to address emerging challenges and opportunities. Our ultimate goal is to create a world where access to sustainable and modern energy is not a privilege but a fundamental right, empowering communities to unlock their full potential and paving the way for a more equitable and prosperous future for all.
