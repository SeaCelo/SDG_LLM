The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) presents this analytical report on the current status and challenges of Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7), which aims to "ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all."

The world has made significant strides in expanding access to electricity and clean cooking fuels, with the global electrification rate reaching 90% in 2019, up from 83% in 2010. However, progress has been uneven, and disparities persist across regions and income levels. Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region with the largest access deficit, with nearly half of the population lacking access to electricity and over 85% lacking access to clean cooking fuels and technologies.

The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing challenges and underscored the critical role of energy access in enabling resilient healthcare systems, remote work and education, and economic recovery. The disruptions caused by the pandemic have highlighted the vulnerability of traditional energy supply chains and the need for more diversified, decentralized, and sustainable energy solutions.

Achieving SDG 7 hinges on accelerating the transition to renewable energy sources, which accounted for only 17.7% of global final energy consumption in 2019. While the share of renewables in the electricity sector has increased, reaching 26.6% in 2019, progress in the heating, cooling, and transportation sectors has been slower. Scaling up investment in renewable energy technologies, such as solar, wind, and geothermal, is essential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.

Energy efficiency measures also play a crucial role in improving access to affordable and sustainable energy services. Implementing energy efficiency policies and technologies in buildings, industry, and transportation can reduce energy demand and associated costs, making energy more affordable for households and businesses. However, many countries lack the necessary regulatory frameworks, financial incentives, and technical expertise to effectively promote energy efficiency.

Achieving universal access to modern energy services requires addressing the specific needs and challenges of different population groups, particularly those living in remote and rural areas. Decentralized renewable energy solutions, such as off-grid solar systems and mini-grids, offer promising alternatives to traditional grid extension, but their deployment has been hindered by regulatory barriers, limited financing, and capacity constraints.

Gender equality is another critical consideration in the pursuit of SDG 7. Women and girls often bear a disproportionate burden in collecting traditional biomass fuels, which can have adverse impacts on their health, safety, and educational and economic opportunities. Ensuring access to modern energy services can empower women and promote gender equality by reducing time spent on energy-related tasks and enabling income-generating activities.

Mobilizing adequate financing remains a significant challenge in achieving SDG 7. According to estimates, achieving universal access to electricity and clean cooking fuels by 2030 would require an annual investment of $51 billion, with sub-Saharan Africa requiring the largest share. Innovative financing mechanisms, such as public-private partnerships, green bonds, and climate finance, are necessary to attract the required investments and leverage private sector resources.

International cooperation and knowledge sharing are also crucial for accelerating progress towards SDG 7. Initiatives such as the Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All) partnership and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) have played pivotal roles in promoting policy dialogue, capacity building, and technology transfer among countries. However, more concerted efforts are needed to align national policies, regulatory frameworks, and incentives with the overarching goals of SDG 7.

In conclusion, achieving SDG 7 requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the complex interplay of technological, economic, social, and environmental factors. Governments, private sector actors, civil society organizations, and international institutions must collaborate to catalyze the necessary investments, enabling policies, and capacity-building efforts to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all.
