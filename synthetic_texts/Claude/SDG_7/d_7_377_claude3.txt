Ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all is a critical component of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and a key enabler for achieving many of the other objectives. The Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation ACP-EU (CTA) recognizes the vital role of energy in supporting agricultural productivity, food security, and rural development, and has been actively engaged in promoting sustainable energy solutions in the African, Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) regions.

In recent years, the CTA has collaborated with various stakeholders, including national governments, international organizations, and local communities, to implement initiatives that address the multifaceted challenges associated with SDG 7. One of the key focus areas has been the promotion of renewable energy sources, particularly in remote rural areas where access to the national grid is limited or non-existent.

Through partnerships with organizations such as the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the Alliance for Rural Electrification (ARE), the CTA has facilitated the deployment of decentralized renewable energy systems, including solar photovoltaic (PV) installations, small-scale hydropower plants, and biogas digesters. These initiatives have not only provided clean and reliable energy for lighting, cooking, and productive uses but have also fostered economic opportunities and improved livelihoods in rural communities.

The CTA's approach has been holistic, recognizing the interconnectedness of energy, agriculture, and rural development. For instance, the organization has supported the integration of solar-powered irrigation systems, enabling smallholder farmers to increase crop yields and improve food security. Additionally, the CTA has promoted the use of renewable energy in agro-processing and value addition activities, reducing post-harvest losses and enhancing the competitiveness of agricultural products in local and international markets.

Furthermore, the CTA has been at the forefront of capacity-building efforts, providing technical assistance and training to local communities, entrepreneurs, and policymakers. These initiatives have focused on developing skills in renewable energy technologies, project management, and sustainable business models, empowering local stakeholders to drive their own energy transitions.

One noteworthy example is the CTA's partnership with the ECOWAS Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (ECREEE) in West Africa. Together, they have implemented the ECOWAS Renewable Energy Entrepreneurship Support Facility, which has trained over 1,000 entrepreneurs and facilitated the establishment of numerous renewable energy businesses across the region. This initiative has not only increased energy access but has also created employment opportunities and fostered economic growth.

In the Caribbean region, the CTA has collaborated with the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the Caribbean Renewable Energy Development Programme (CREDP) to support the adoption of renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency measures. These efforts have been particularly crucial in addressing the energy security challenges faced by many island nations, which are heavily reliant on imported fossil fuels and vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.

Recognizing the importance of policy and regulatory frameworks, the CTA has also engaged with national governments and regional bodies to promote enabling environments for sustainable energy transitions. This has included supporting the development of energy policies, regulations, and incentive schemes that encourage private sector investment and community participation in renewable energy projects.

Moving forward, the CTA remains committed to supporting the achievement of SDG 7 and the broader sustainable development agenda. The organization recognizes the need for continued innovation, knowledge-sharing, and collaboration among stakeholders to overcome the remaining barriers and accelerate the transition towards clean, affordable, and reliable energy for all.
