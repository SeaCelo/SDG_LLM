Malteser International's report on Sustainable Development Goal 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all

As a leading humanitarian aid organization, Malteser International recognizes the pivotal role of accessible and sustainable energy in alleviating poverty, improving healthcare, and fostering economic growth. The realization of SDG 7 is intrinsically linked to our mission of empowering vulnerable communities and promoting human dignity.

The global energy landscape remains a stark dichotomy, with millions still lacking access to reliable and affordable energy sources. In sub-Saharan Africa, over 600 million individuals lack access to electricity, while nearly 900 million rely on traditional biomass for cooking and heating, posing severe health risks and contributing to environmental degradation. This energy poverty perpetuates a vicious cycle of underdevelopment, limiting educational opportunities, hampering economic activities, and straining already overburdened healthcare systems.

Malteser International's holistic approach to SDG 7 encompasses three interconnected pillars: energy access, renewable energy, and energy efficiency.

Energy Access: Our initiatives prioritize off-grid and mini-grid solutions tailored to the unique needs of remote and underserved communities. Through partnerships with local organizations and community-driven projects, we facilitate the deployment of decentralized renewable energy systems, such as solar home systems, solar lanterns, and micro-hydropower plants. These solutions not only provide clean lighting and power but also enable income-generating activities, enhancing economic resilience. Additionally, we advocate for inclusive energy policies and financing mechanisms to ensure affordability and long-term sustainability.

Renewable Energy: Recognizing the urgency of climate action, Malteser International actively promotes the transition to renewable energy sources. In our humanitarian responses, we integrate renewable energy solutions into our healthcare facilities, shelters, and water and sanitation systems, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and mitigating environmental impact. Furthermore, we collaborate with local partners to develop renewable energy projects, such as solar farms and wind parks, fostering community ownership and capacity building.

Energy Efficiency: Complementing our efforts in energy access and renewable energy, we prioritize energy efficiency measures across our operations and within the communities we serve. Through training programs and awareness campaigns, we equip individuals with knowledge and practical skills to optimize energy consumption, reduce waste, and adopt energy-efficient technologies. This holistic approach not only minimizes environmental impact but also generates cost savings, allowing scarce resources to be redirected towards other developmental priorities.

Malteser International's interventions are guided by a commitment to community empowerment and local ownership. We engage extensively with local stakeholders, including governments, civil society organizations, and community leaders, to ensure our initiatives are culturally sensitive, sustainable, and aligned with local priorities. Through capacity-building programs, we transfer knowledge and skills to local partners, fostering long-term self-reliance and resilience.

Furthermore, we recognize the inextricable link between energy and other Sustainable Development Goals. Access to sustainable energy is a catalyst for progress in areas such as health, education, water and sanitation, and gender equality. Our integrated approach addresses these interconnections, leveraging synergies and maximizing impact.

In our pursuit of SDG 7, we confront numerous challenges, including inadequate infrastructure, limited financing, and policy barriers. However, through our expertise, strategic partnerships, and unwavering commitment, we strive to overcome these obstacles and create lasting positive change.

Malteser International's mission to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all is not merely a goal; it is a moral imperative that underpins our humanitarian efforts. By empowering communities with sustainable energy solutions, we pave the way for a future where no one is left behind, where human dignity is upheld, and where the transformative power of energy catalyzes progress towards a more equitable and prosperous world.
