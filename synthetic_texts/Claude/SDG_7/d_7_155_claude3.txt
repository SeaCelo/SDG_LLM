Here is a detailed academic article about the Sustainable Development Goal 7 (affordable and clean energy) as if written by the columnist Maureen Dowd:

The Bright Idea the World Has Been Stupidly Ignoring

We're hurtling toward a dystopian future with more scorching summers, deadlier storms, and coastal cities becoming modern-day Atlantises. Yet while the planet burns and politicians fiddle, there's a blazingly obvious solution we've been foolishly ignoring: getting affordable, emissions-free energy to every corner of the globe.

It's Goal 7 of the U.N.'s Sustainable Development Goals, the one about ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030. Simple, right? Except we're nowhere close. Nearly a billion people still have no access to electricity, and billions more rely on polluting and inefficient fuels like kerosene, wood and dung to cook and heat their homes.

Talk about a bright idea being obscured by clouds of ignorance and lack of political willpower. Affordable clean energy is the golden key to unlocking a panoply of other development goals - it reduces poverty, increases economic growth, mitigates climate change, and provides a bazillion additional cascading benefits.

Think about it: Something as basic as electricity in the home means kids can study after dark, enabling better education. It allows for lights, refrigeration and internet connectivity that improve health and economic well-being. Sustainable modern energy means more productive industries, less pollution choking cities, and fewer carbon emissions exacerbating climate change and melting the polar ice caps.

Honestly, what are we waiting for? An apocalyptic meteor to wipe civilization off the map? 

Instead of pouring trillions into weapons and tax cuts for hedge funders, we should be marshaling a revolutionary new sustainable energy guerrilla army to electrify the developing world on the double. Advances in solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal and next-generation nuclear could provide affordable, clean and reliable power to everyone on the planet by 2030 - if we simply got motivated.

The potential benefits would be astronomical. Emerging economies would develop faster, slashing poverty and hunger. Urbanization pressures would ease, reducing slum growth in teeming mega-cities. Deadly indoor air pollution from dirty cooking fuels, which kills millions annually, would be eliminated. And of course, lowering greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of fossil fuels could help start stanching the climate crisis.

Yet even as the world teeters on the precipice, leaders still dawdle on accelerating this self-evidently positive energy transformation. What's their deal? Pandering to fossil fuel interests? Lacking visionary ambition? Or just the usual complacent stupidity we've come to expect?

Well, knock it off, fellas. Time to show some audacity and finally take this obvious, critical first step toward a more prosperous and sustainable planet. Stop the dithering and pussyfooting around with incremental change. Be bold! Be resolute! Launch a people's revolution for universally accessible, emissions-free energy now.

It'll take laser-focused policies, smart incentives, creative financing, technology transfers and public-private partnerships. But that "impossible" dream is imminently doable if we dedicate ourselves. Just look at the astonishing growth of solar and wind already. Now picture getting that clean energy to every village on Earth so that people in rural Malawi can have light at night just like in Manhattan. 

Such a venture has the power to advance civilization and protect the planet in a monumental way. It would lift billions out of poverty, inject economic dynamism into stagnant regions, and reduce catastrophic climate risks by minimizing greenhouse gas emissions. Talk about getting more enlightened society-wide through enlightening energy access!

Of all the well-meaning United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, this is the one that should be shiningly obvious and non-negotiable. It's the bright beacon showing the clear path forward for humanity. So let's stop stumbling around in the dark, torching the planet as we go. Time to switch on the light and see the possibility for real progress by ensuring sustainable energy for all.
