Here is a draft academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), written from the perspective of Thomas Friedman:

Flat, Hot, and Crowded: The Urgent Need for an Energy Revolution

We live in an era of dizzying acceleration on multiple fronts - globalization, climate change, biodiversity loss, population growth, and more. Never before has the world been so intricately interwoven through trade, outsourcing, supply chains, and the free movement of information, people, and ideas. Yet this very integration and hyper-connectivity that generated so much prosperity for billions now threatens to undermine the fragile ecological systems that sustain human civilization.  

Energy is the master resource that powers this globalized world of ours. Scalable, affordable, and clean energy solutions are paramount to tackling the multiple stresses we face. Fossil fuels have been the bedrock allowing modern industrial societies to emerge and much of the developing world to rapidly advance. However, we cannot keep burning oil, gas, and coal with abandon while the planet irreversibly heats up and chokes on its own emissions. A clean energy revolution, driven by policy foresight and innovative technology disruptions, is urgently needed.

The nexus of energy, climate change, and global development represents one of the greatest tests of sustainability facing humanity. As I've chronicled, the world is getting "hot, flat, and crowded" at an exponential rate. Global energy demand continues its inexorable rise, driven by population growth and the push by billions to attain middle class lifestyles and living standards. Climate scientists warn in increasingly apocalyptic terms that we must decarbonize the world economy by 2050 to avoid triggering irreversible climate tipping points and ecosystem collapse.

Yet the solutions exist today - they just need to be supercharged through robust public-private collaboration, smart polices, and catalytic financing. In many cases, clean energy technologies like solar, wind, batteries, and energy efficiency are increasingly cost-competitive with or cheaper than fossil fuels. Wind and solar in particular have achieved amazing price deflation and scalability over the past decade. The roadmap is clear – double down on deployment of proven clean tech while advancing cutting-edge innovations in long-duration storage, green hydrogen, advanced nuclear, and carbon capture. 

Rapidly industrializing and urbanizing nations like China, India, Nigeria, and Indonesia will be ground zero for implementing affordable clean energy at massive scale. These major emerging markets have an opportunity to leapfrog legacy energy systems and infrastructure by scaling up distributed renewable grids, mini-grids, and other decentralized solutions for the urban masses and rural poor currently lacking access to reliable electricity.

In an age of persistent geopolitical turbulence and resurgent nationalism, catalyzing an energy revolution is one of the few opportunities for true global collaboration in our collective self-interest. It offers a powerful retort to civilizational pessimism by harnessing the awesome power of human ingenuity, innovation, and entrepreneurial problem-solving. Clean disruptions are upending energy, agriculture, manufacturing, transportation and beyond – we just need to lean into these disruptive forces.

Affordable, reliable, and clean energy access is truly the spark for advancing every other sustainable development priority – lifting billions out of poverty, empowering women, improving health and education, catalyzing industries and economic growth, and mitigating climate shocks. A world powered by clean energy tempered by human solidarity and renewal offers humanity's best path for surmounting the millennial challenges rapidly converging.  

The Great Environmental Disruption of decarbonizing the global economy and overhauling legacy energy systems may be the greatest test of collective action facing our species. But it represents a profound opportunity to reimagine human possibility and reinvent the energy foundations of modern progress. We can keep adding more energy to satisfy rising human demands while eliminating the environmental destruction caused by fossil fuels. The solutions exist - what's needed is the foresight, political courage, and collaborative will to supercharge humanity's clean energy transition before it's too late.
