Achieving universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services, as outlined in Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7), is a critical prerequisite for sustainable development and economic progress. The International Labour Organization (ILO) recognizes the inextricable link between energy access, decent work opportunities, and poverty alleviation.

The global energy landscape remains characterized by stark disparities, with approximately 759 million people lacking access to electricity and 2.6 billion relying on inefficient and polluting cooking fuels, according to the ILO's latest estimates. These energy access deficits disproportionately affect rural populations, women, and marginalized communities, exacerbating existing inequalities and hindering socio-economic advancement.

The ILO's analysis indicates that energy poverty perpetuates a vicious cycle of economic instability, stifling productivity, hindering educational attainment, and posing severe health risks. Women and children, in particular, bear the brunt of the burden associated with traditional biomass collection and exposure to indoor air pollution, limiting their participation in the formal workforce and educational opportunities.

Transitioning to sustainable energy systems is not only an environmental imperative but also a powerful catalyst for job creation and economic development. The ILO's projections suggest that accelerating the uptake of renewable energy and energy efficiency measures could create up to 24 million new jobs by 2030, primarily in sectors such as construction, manufacturing, and installation.

However, this transition must be carefully managed to ensure a just and equitable transition for workers and communities currently reliant on fossil fuel industries. The ILO's policy recommendations emphasize the need for comprehensive reskilling and upskilling initiatives, social protection measures, and inclusive dialogue with all stakeholders, including workers' organizations and employers.

Moreover, the ILO recognizes the critical role of international cooperation and partnerships in mobilizing the necessary resources and knowledge transfer to support developing nations in their pursuit of sustainable energy solutions. Initiatives such as the ILO's Green Jobs Programme and the Partnership for Action on Green Economy (PAGE) are instrumental in fostering capacity-building, promoting green entrepreneurship, and facilitating the adoption of innovative technologies and best practices.

Achieving SDG 7 requires a holistic approach that addresses the multifaceted challenges of energy poverty, climate change, and sustainable development. The ILO's expertise in labor standards, social dialogue, and employment policies positions it as a crucial partner in this endeavor, ensuring that the transition to sustainable energy systems is driven by the principles of decent work, social justice, and environmental sustainability.

By promoting inclusive energy policies, fostering green skills development, and advocating for worker rights and social protection, the ILO plays a pivotal role in unlocking the transformative potential of sustainable energy for job creation, economic growth, and human development, thereby advancing the broader 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
