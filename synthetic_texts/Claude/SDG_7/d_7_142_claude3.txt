Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) as if written by journalist Mike Barnicle:

The world's thirst for energy seems unquenchable these days. From the humming data centers that power our digital lives to the smokestacks belching fumes to provide electricity, our modern existence runs on a furious appetite for power. But at what cost to the planet does this insatiable energy demand come? The United Nations has codified an audacious objective with its Sustainable Development Goal 7 - to "ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all" by 2030. A noble and necessary aim, to be sure, but one fraught with monumental challenges that will test our resolve as a global community.

Let's take stock of where we stand today. Despite incredible technological advancements, a stunning 789 million people worldwide still lack access to electricity. That's nearly one in ten human beings consigned to a life dimly lit by candles and firelight after sunset. The humanitarian tolls are devastating - students struggle to learn, clinics operate in shadows, economic opportunities are curtailed. But the impacts stretch far beyond, with household air pollution from burning solid fuels like wood and charcoal causing a horrific 4 million premature deaths annually. A smoldering crime against the poorest of the poor.

Meanwhile, in the prosperous corners where reliable electricity flows freely, the costs of our energy gluttony become ever more ruinous. The emission of greenhouse gases from fossil fuels continues unabated, turbo-charging climate change with all its calamitous consequences - rising seas, raging wildfires, searing droughts. On our current trajectory, we're barreling towards a scorched and unrecognizable planet within a couple generations. An intergenerational betrayal that would be unforgivable.

So how do we untangle this Gordian knot? How to satisfy the world's burgeoning energy needs while curtailing the greenhouse gas emissions threatening our very existence? The solutions won't be easy or cheap, but the UN's sustainable energy roadmap provides powerful guideposts.

First and foremost, we need a revolution in renewable energy, doubling down on wind, solar, geothermal and other clean sources. It's an area where the progress has been heartening - renewables grew at a blistering pace over the past decade, raising their share of global electricity output from 16% to around 25%. Costs have plummeted as technologies improve and production scales up. A 2019 report found that two-thirds of wind and solar projects built that year raised electricity at lower prices than even the cheapest new coal plants.  

But continued innovation and investment will be critical to make renewable energy affordable and ubiquitous everywhere it's needed. From rural micro-grids bringing electricity to remote villages, to modernizing rickety urban power grids, to powering the heavy industries and transportation sectors that remain obstinately dependent on fossil fuels. It's a herculean challenge that will require the mobilization of both public and private capital on unprecedented scales.

In tandem, we simply must get more efficient with our energy use - attacking the rampant wastefulness that developed and developing nations are both guilty of. The marginal gains from energy efficiency improvements like LED lightbulbs, better insulation and industrial process tweaks have been impressive. But we're still paltzing around the fringes relative to our potential. Witness the countless office towers blazingly lit throughout vacant night hours or the millions of gas-guzzlers clogging America's highways at rush hours twice daily - a grossly inefficient use of fuel and money. We need a full-court press on energy efficiency through a combination of financial incentives, legal mandates, and cultural change.

These objectives are not mere luxuries - they are existential imperatives for the human species. Time is running short to alter our current disastrous energy course. With the population headed towards 10 billion souls and corresponding rising demand, renewable energy and efficiency are the only sustainable paths forward. As a planet we all share the same existential threat, and only through globally coordinated actions can we defeat the climate menace while ensuring universal access to clean, affordable power.   

The UN's Sustainable Development Goals have sketched out the blueprints for this energy transition - now comes the hard part of mustering the economic resources, political will, and human commitment to turn these lofty ambitions into reality. It won't be easy, but the alternative is too bleak to ponder. Failure is not an option - not for our sakes, or for the generations who will inherit the consequences of our age's decisions. So let's cast off the dated thinking and rancorous politics that have shackled us, and forge boldly ahead to a clean, prosperous energy future that safeguards both human development and our fragile planet's well-being. The 21st century is calling - it's make or break time as the clock ticks down to 2030.
