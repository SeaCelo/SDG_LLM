Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), written from the perspective of economist Daron Acemoglu:

Affordable and sustainable energy is a lynchpin issue that cuts across the entire sustainable development agenda. Access to low-cost and reliable energy is fundamental for alleviating poverty, improving public health, increasing productivity and economic growth, mitigating climate change, and achieving greater socioeconomic equity within and across nations. However, the world's current energy mix is utterly unsustainable due to its overwhelming reliance on polluting fossil fuels and inefficient distribution. Transitioning to clean, renewable sources is technologically feasible but hindered by a multitude of economic and political economy constraints.

An energy transition of this magnitude represents a classic problem of directed technical change. Innovations in clean energy technologies have been taking place, particularly in solar, wind, and battery storage. However, these innovations remain at a small scale relative to the enormous entrenched market power of legacy producers of fossil fuels and related technologies. Overcoming this technologicallock-in and path dependence requires policy commitment and complementary investments across multiple components of energy systems. 

From an economic perspective, energy markets exhibit several key sources of non-convexities, path dependence, and market failures. Carbon emissions are a classic negative externality whose social costs are not priced into markets. Monopolistic structures inhibit competition and excessively delay the introduction of disruptive clean technologies. Misaligned expectations and perceptions of technological risks hamper investment. Public goods issues prevent coordination for infrastructure development. And innovation spillovers lead to underinvestment in new technologies from an economy-wide perspective.

A comprehensive policy framework is needed to simultaneously correct these market failures and provide robust incentives for innovation and mass deployment of affordable clean energy solutions. This includes economically meaningful carbon pricing mechanisms, support for R&D in renewable technologies, facilitation of technology transfer to lower-income nations, streamlining of market regulation and urban planning for clean infrastructure investments, and transitional compensation for displaced workers. However, implementation of such policies is rife with political economy challenges stemming from the influence of status quo interests, ideological opposition, and lack of institutional capacity in some jurisdictions.

The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated how sudden shocks can disrupt energy systems and supply chains, underscoring the value of decentralized and resilient renewable sources integrated into smart grid infrastructure. But it also highlighted that policy commitment can shift rapidly in response to focusing events. Clean energy investment must be framed as a strategic priority for economic competitiveness and environmental security in the face of climate risks and energy insecurity.

Long-run projections show the renewable energy transition will generate sizeable aggregate economic benefits relative to continued dependence on fossil fuels. However, disruptive technical change also creates winners and losers in specific industries, occupations, and geographic regions. Managing these distributional impacts and implementing complementary policies for reskilling labor and developing new industries in adversely affected areas is crucial for ensuring an inclusive energy transition.

The geopolitics of energy are rapidly shifting with the rise of cheaper renewable technologies, creating new tensions and cross-cutting alliances across countries based on divergent natural resource endowments and economic interests. Understanding how power dynamics and conflict could evolve in this new clean energy landscape must be a priority for policymakers and development strategists, lest energy insecurity issues persist or intensify.

Finally, energy usage patterns interact with other sustainable development goals through complex system dynamics. For example, the achievement of goals around industrialization, urbanization, and increases in agricultural productivity will drive increasing energy demand in many developing countries. Meeting this demand through fossil fuels exacerbates environmental damage, creating counterproductive feedback loops. Integrated modeling and planning is needed to understand and proactively manage these systems effects. Innovative institutions and governance frameworks must be cultivated to navigate these complex sociotechnical transformations with coherent long-term strategies.

In sum, SDG 7 is inextricably linked to our ability to address the grand challenge of sustainable development in its multifaceted economic, environmental, and social dimensions. Overcoming entrenched economic forces and vested interests resisting energy transition will require perseverance, new paradigms of technological change, multi-stakeholder collaboration, and an unswerving commitment to intergenerational wellbeing as our guiding principle for policymaking. While the obstacles are daunting, the imperative of affordable and clean energy could not be higher. Our capacity for innovation and pragmatic economic reforms will determine our success in catalyzing this most crucial sustainability revolution.
