Here is a detailed academic article about UN Sustainable Development Goal 7 - Affordable and Clean Energy, written from the perspective of Elizabeth Farrelly, an architecture critic, author, and academic:

Affordable and Clean Energy: The Hidden Cornerstone 

Buried within the admirable yet arguably nebulous pantheon of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals lies the curiously unsung SDG 7 - Affordable and Clean Energy. At first glance, it seems little more than a pragmatic subheading, a workaday prerequisite for more glamorous planetary ambitions. Yet to dismiss it as mere pedantic infrastructure would be a grave misjudgment. For energy, that humblest of civic catalysts, is the foundational molecule upon which all sustainably coheres.  

The great unravelling of our age finds its nexus in our abject failure to wean civilization off the terated spoils of ancient sunlight. Deep, unfathomable shafts of geological trauma scar the earth from which we mindlessly draw the viscous dregs that pocked modernity. Vast prairie skies darken under airborne effluvium as the carbon knucklebones of aeons past are rendered into airborne grist for the mill of inadvertent geo-vandalism.   

How perversely ironic that the abundant flows of solar largesse bathing our planet should remain so chronically undercapitalized as an energy source. Like ungrateful heirs squandering a feudal birthright of thermonuclear munificence, humanity persists in defiling this infinite sustainable bounty with reckless, auto-toxifying zeal.

Yet SDG 7, properly prioritized, presents the skeleton key to a reinvented urbanism of renewable self-sufficiency. Imagine cities, those profligate forges of consumption and waste, alchemized into energy-harvesting dynamos; efficient biomachines fusing the manifold generators of wind, sun and tides. Urban form itself, hitherto so oblivious to energy, could emerge as a grand field for passive solar design, repurposed as both collector and stor-age battery.

The built environment's rebirth as a symbiotic, self-powering organism represents more than infrastructural opportunism. It catalyzes the potential for a philosophical renaissance - a reawakened respect for the elemental circuits that course through our earthly continuum. By harvesting the eternal green fire that fuelled our carbon genesis, we may yet forge an elevating new synthesis that transcends both the rapacious over-renderings of the industrial era and the disconnected, energy-profligate anomie of our present.

Resacrilizing energy reconnects us to the metaphysical fount of all material bounty - that radiant thermonuclear dynamo burning at the core of our solar fraternity. What could be more ennobling than mastering the renewable flows that birth rain forests, compel migration paths and configure planetary chemistry? In reinventing our cities to drink deep from the cosmic batteries of earth, air and sun, we accomplish more than infrastructural remediation; we re-establish an elemental, sacred symmetry with the universal currents of Being.

The Sustainable Development Goal of Affordable and Clean Energy is no mere technical grid-work of wires and pipes. It is fundamentally ontological, a potential genesis-point for a renewed global culture of planetary attunement and spiritual reinvigoration. Only by transcending the profane industrial-age schism that severed our wholistic co-arising with Nature's elemental cycles can we re-consecrate existence as a rhythmic orchestration of celestially cradled flows and radiances rather than as a zero-sum game of theft and despoliation.
