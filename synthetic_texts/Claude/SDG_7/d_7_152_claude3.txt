Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), written from the perspective of Gail Collins:

"Let's talk about power â€” the power to light up homes, run factories, and charge those ubiquitous devices we're all addicted to these days. For too long, we've taken affordable and sustainable energy sources for granted, obliviously burning through fossil fuels without a thought for the consequences. But the party's over, folks. Climate change is raging, pollution is soaring, and if we don't get our energy act together soon, future generations will be left sitting in the dark. 

As a global community, we embraced the Sustainable Development Goals back in 2015, vowing to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030. Well, the clock is ticking, and we're not exactly setting the world on fire with our progress so far (no pun intended). Just look at the numbers: 759 million people still lack access to electricity, and a staggering 2.6 billion rely on unhealthy cooking fuels like wood, charcoal, and dung. In sub-Saharan Africa, over 900 million people remain in energy poverty - that's roughly 70% of the population! It's a shameful statistic in the 21st century.

And let's not forget the human cost of our complacency. Every year, household air pollution from dirty cooking fuels claims nearly 4 million lives, with women and children disproportionately affected. Meanwhile, the lack of reliable electricity sabotages economic growth, hampers education, and undermines efforts to provide basic services in remote areas. It's a vicious cycle of poverty and energy deprivation that we can't seem to break.

Of course, the elephant in the room is our continued reliance on fossil fuels - those ancient energy sources that spew greenhouse gases and pollutants into our air, land, and water. Renewable sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power offer a cleaner, greener, and increasingly cost-effective alternative. Yet progress has been painfully slow, with renewables accounting for just 17% of global energy consumption in 2019. And don't get me started on energy efficiency - a massive opportunity that's been woefully underexploited worldwide.

The good news? Innovative technologies and bold government policies are starting to turn the tide. In India, the world's largest renewable energy expansion program has brought electricity to millions of rural households. Kenya is rapidly embracing geothermal and wind power, while Morocco has built a massive solar plant in the Sahara Desert. Even oil-rich nations like Saudi Arabia and the UAE are investing big in clean energy initiatives to diversify their economies.

But let's be real - transitioning to a sustainable energy future won't be easy. It will require trillions in investment, sweeping regulatory reforms, and a fundamental shift in how we produce, distribute, and consume energy. Fossil fuel diehards will fight us every step of the way, protecting their lucrative (but environmentally disastrous) turf. Developing nations will need massive financial and technical support to leapfrog outdated energy systems. And all of us - governments, businesses, and individuals - must embrace energy efficiency as the lowest-hanging fruit.

So let's roll up our sleeves and get to work, folks. The clock is ticking, the stakes are high, and our children's future depends on the energy choices we make today. We owe it to them - and to ourselves - to create a world where affordable, clean energy is a right, not a privilege. A world where air is fit to breathe, economies can thrive, and the planet has a fighting chance. It won't be easy, but nothing worth fighting for ever is. Let's light a fire under ourselves and get this sustainable energy revolution started. The future is counting on us."
