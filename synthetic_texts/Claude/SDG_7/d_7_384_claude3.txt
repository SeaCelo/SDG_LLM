As the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, I am compelled to address the critical intersection between sustainable energy access and the plight of forcibly displaced populations worldwide. Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7), which aims to "ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all," holds profound implications for the well-being and resilience of refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs).

The lack of access to clean and reliable energy sources is a pervasive challenge faced by many displaced communities, exacerbating their vulnerability and hindering their ability to rebuild their lives. Refugee camps and informal settlements often rely on hazardous and inefficient energy sources, such as firewood, charcoal, and kerosene, which pose severe health risks and contribute to environmental degradation. The negative impacts of these traditional energy sources disproportionately affect women and children, who bear the burden of collecting firewood and are exposed to harmful indoor air pollution.

Addressing energy poverty in displacement settings is not only a matter of basic human rights but also a crucial enabler for achieving multiple SDGs. Access to modern energy services can unlock opportunities for education, healthcare, water and sanitation, and livelihoods, fostering self-reliance and promoting the integration of displaced populations into host communities.

In this context, it is imperative to adopt a holistic and context-specific approach to energy provision in displacement settings. This involves leveraging a diverse range of sustainable energy solutions, including decentralized renewable energy systems, energy-efficient technologies, and innovative financing mechanisms.

Decentralized renewable energy systems, such as solar photovoltaic (PV) installations and micro-grids, offer a promising solution for providing clean and reliable energy to displaced communities. These systems are modular, scalable, and can be rapidly deployed, making them well-suited for the dynamic and often temporary nature of displacement settings. Furthermore, they contribute to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and reducing the environmental footprint of displacement operations.

Energy-efficient technologies, such as improved cookstoves and energy-efficient lighting, can significantly reduce the energy burden on displaced populations while enhancing their safety and well-being. These technologies not only reduce indoor air pollution and associated health risks but also alleviate the time and physical strain associated with traditional energy sources, particularly for women and children.

Innovative financing mechanisms, such as result-based financing, public-private partnerships, and climate finance instruments, can play a crucial role in mobilizing the necessary resources and fostering sustainable energy investments in displacement contexts. By leveraging blended finance and de-risking mechanisms, we can create an enabling environment for the private sector to participate in energy service delivery, while ensuring affordability and accessibility for displaced populations.

Collaboration and coordination among humanitarian organizations, development agencies, host governments, and the private sector are essential to achieving lasting solutions. Fostering an enabling policy environment, building local capacity, and promoting the participation of displaced populations in energy planning and decision-making processes are critical for ensuring the sustainability and appropriateness of interventions.

It is worth highlighting successful examples of sustainable energy initiatives in displacement settings, such as the Refugee Settlements and Host Communities (Re-SeHoC) project in Uganda, which has provided clean cooking solutions and solar energy systems to refugee settlements and host communities. Similarly, the Moving Energy Initiative in Jordan has facilitated the deployment of solar PV systems in refugee camps, improving access to electricity while creating livelihood opportunities for refugees.

However, despite these promising initiatives, significant gaps and challenges remain. Funding constraints, institutional barriers, and the complexity of displacement contexts continue to hinder the scale-up and sustainability of energy interventions. Addressing these challenges requires a concerted global effort, driven by strong political commitment, innovative partnerships, and a steadfast dedication to leaving no one behind.

As the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, I urge the international community to prioritize sustainable energy access as a critical enabler for the well-being, resilience, and self-reliance of displaced populations. By harnessing the transformative potential of sustainable energy solutions, we can not only alleviate the immediate suffering of those forcibly displaced but also pave the way for their long-term integration, empowerment, and contribution to sustainable development in their host communities and beyond.
