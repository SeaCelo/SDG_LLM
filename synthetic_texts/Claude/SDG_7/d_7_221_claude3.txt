Here is a draft academic article on SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) as if written by the economist Alberto Alesina:

The challenge of providing affordable and clean energy for all (SDG 7) is one that requires carefully balancing economic efficiency and environmental sustainability. While the goal is laudable in its intent to ensure access to reliable, modern energy services at an affordable cost while reducing harmful emissions and pollutants, the practical implementation faces significant hurdles across countries at varying levels of economic development.

From a public economics perspective, energy markets are rife with externalities that require thoughtful policy interventions. The combustion of fossil fuels for electricity generation and transportation imposes a negative externality in the form of greenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change, as well as more localized environmental damages from particulate matter and other pollutants. However, the transition toward renewable energy sources carries its own set of economic frictions in the form of higher capital costs, intermittency issues requiring energy storage solutions, and integration challenges with existing grid infrastructure.  

Evaluating these tradeoffs through the lens of cost-benefit analysis reveals stark disparities across nations. Many developing countries face severe energy poverty, with hundreds of millions lacking basic access to electricity. For these populations, the development benefits of reliable and affordable energy likely outweigh climate change externalities in the near term. UN data indicates the highest energy deficits are concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa, where over 600 million people lack access to electricity. Fossil fuel or hydroelectric options, despite environmental costs, may represent the most viable path to catalyzing economic growth, increasing productivity, and reducing poverty for these societies.  

In contrast, developed economies face a different cost-benefit calculus given relatively rich energy access but disproportionate contributions to global greenhouse gas emissions. Stringent policies promoting renewables integration and emissions mitigation are better suited for these nations that can bear the upfront capital investments. But there too, political economy frictions loom large in the form of regulatory capture by fossil fuel incumbents, NIMBYism obstructing renewable installations, and public resistance to internalizing environmental costs.

Ultimately, the way forward requires a balanced, incentive-compatible approach tailored across contexts. For the poorest nations, policies promoting low-cost fossil fuel or hydroelectric capacity may maximize social welfare in the interim by enabling economic development and energy access as an engine of growth. But these should be coupled with investments in renewable technologies to gradually transition the energy mix. Affluent countries should lead the way on renewables deployment leveraging a mix of carbon pricing, subsidies, and regulatory reforms to overcome political barriers.

International coordination is paramount, as climate change is a global public goods problem requiring collective action. Financial and technology transfers from rich to poor nations can facilitate leapfrogging to renewable energy while respecting differentiated responsibilities and capabilities in emissions reductions. Carefully designed mechanisms channeling green investment flows to high-impact opportunities in frontier markets are crucial for making affordable and clean energy a reality worldwide.

In essence, SDG 7 typifies the grand challenge sustainable development poses for marrying economic prosperity and environmental preservation. Hard tradeoffs exist, with valid arguments on all sides. But pragmatic, evidence-based policies accounting for heterogeneous constraints can navigate a path that uplifts human welfare globally while respecting ecological boundaries. It demands innovative, context-specific solutions, international cooperation, and a recognition that one-size-fits-all prescriptions are ill-suited for such a vital, complex objective.
