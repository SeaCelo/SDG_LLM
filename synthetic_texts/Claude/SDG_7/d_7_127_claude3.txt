Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy, written from the perspective of the late journalist and author Bernard Levin:

The Sisyphean Struggle for Sustainable Energy Access

I find myself increasingly drawn to the topic of universal energy access and its bewildering paradoxes as the world hurtles towards potential ecological collapse. The concept of providing affordable, reliable, and modern energy services to every human being on this fragile planet we call home is as alluring as it is daunting. It represents humanity's aspirational chimera – a tantalizing vision that seems to perpetually slip through our tenuous grasp, much like the mythological boulder continuously rolling back down the hill in the eternal struggle of Sisyphus.

At the heart of this quandary lies Sustainable Development Goal 7 – the United Nations' ambitious target of ensuring universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services by 2030. A admirable and imperative objective, to be sure, but one that grows increasingly Sisyphean with each passing year as the globe's population inexorably swells and the ravages of climate change intensify.

The statistics paint a grim portrait: nearly 800 million people – predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa and developing Asia – remain trapped in the darkness of energy poverty, forced to rely on hazardous and inefficient sources of lighting and heating. The consequences of this deprivation are far-reaching, serving as a pernicious anchor weighing down efforts to alleviate poverty, improve health outcomes, and catalyze economic development.  

Conversely, the relentless pursuit of energy access through conventional means poses an existential threat to the very environment upon which our species depends. The burning of fossil fuels – the dominant source of modern energy – continues to pump untold tonnages of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, fueling the rapidly accelerating climate crisis. A crisis, I might add, that disproportionately impacts the very same populations mired in energy poverty through increasingly frequent and severe weather events, diminished agricultural yields, and other ruinous consequences.

Thus, we find ourselves caught in a Sisyphean loop – damned if we fail to provide universal energy access, equally damned if we pursue it through conventional, carbon-intensive means. A Gordian knot of profound complexity that defies simple solutions.

And yet, glimmers of hope pierce through the seeming futility of our plight. The exponential growth of renewable energy technologies – wind, solar, geothermal, and others – offers a tantalizing path forward. One that could, theoretically, provide affordable and sustainable energy to the masses while mitigating the worst consequences of climate change.

But such a transition is far from straightforward. It requires the mobilization of unprecedented levels of financing, the overcoming of myriad technical and logistical hurdles, and the navigation of complex geopolitical dynamics as nations jockey to secure their parochial energy interests. A Herculean task further compounded by the resistance of deeply entrenched fossil fuel interests hellbent on preserving the status quo for as long as they can squeeze the last lucrative dregs from a planet increasingly hostile to their greed.

So where does that leave us in our Sisyphean struggle? Perpetually rolling the metaphorical boulder up the hill, only for it to tumble back down, again and again, in a cycle of futility? Or slowly, inexorably, making progress – one grueling step at a time – towards the elusive summit of sustainable energy for all?

The path forward is uncertain, fraught with obstacles that would test the most stalwart of optimists. And yet, we must persevere, for the alternative is to surrender to the existential abyss that awaits should we fail. It is a struggle that will define the fate of generations to come – a crucible in which humanity's resilience, ingenuity, and moral fortitude will be tested to its very limits.

In the end, perhaps our Sisyphean toils will prove redemptive, a self-imposed penance to atone for the transgressions we have wrought upon this planetary home we call Earth. A perpetual struggle, yes, but one imbued with purpose and the promise of a world in which no human being is denied the fundamental right to energy – the lifeblood of modern civilization and the key that could unlock a more equitable, prosperous, and sustainable future for us all.

So let us renew our commitment to the audacious goals laid out in SDG 7. Let us roll that proverbial boulder with unwavering determination, secure in the knowledge that our striving is noble, our cause is just, and that in our perpetual struggle lies the redemption we so desperately seek.
