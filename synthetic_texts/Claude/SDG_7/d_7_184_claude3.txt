Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), written from the perspective of conservative commentator Dennis Prager:

The seventh Sustainable Development Goal set forth by the United Nations is to "ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all." On its face, this may seem like a reasonable and even noble aspiration. Of course, everybody wants accessible and affordable energy. The real question, however, is whether the UN's vision is based in reality or leftist fantasy. 

As usual with the UN and its agenda of globalism and secular statism, SDG 7 is grounded more in environmentalist ideology than pragmatic economics or fundamental human rights. The unstated but obvious subtext is a zealous opposition to fossil fuels and a naive faith in inefficient "green" energy like wind and solar power. Of course, the UN has bought into the scientific superstition of catastrophic man-made climate change hook, line, and sinker.

This dogmatic embrace of renewables represents a fundamental misunderstanding of energy markets, human wellbeing, and the very definition of "sustainable." The undeniable reality is that fossil fuels like oil, natural gas, and coal provide the overwhelming majority of the world's energy in a scalable, reliable, and affordable way. In contrast, wind turbines and solar panels remain profoundly inefficient sources of energy density, typically only viable with government subsidies that distort the free market.

The developed world, led by visionary leaders who respect the power of capitalism and human ingenuity, has thrived thanks to the prosperity enabled by fossil fuels over the last two centuries. It is the unfettered access to abundant, low-cost energy from coal, oil, and natural gas that has allowed billions to be lifted out of poverty through economic growth and technological progress.

Meanwhile, it is the world's poorest who have suffered the most from the elitist obstructionism pushed by environmental activists and enforced by unaccountable UN bureaucrats. Places like sub-Saharan Africa and rural India have been denied the extraordinary humanitarian benefits that economic development and electrification bring - from life-saving refrigeration to power modern hospitals, to the light children need to study after sundown.

Making reliable electricity "accessible and affordable for all" is a noble goal that no moral person can oppose. The path to achieving it, however, lies in embracing the liberating power of free markets, property rights, and human innovation - not the heavy hand of UN centralization, oppressive regulations, and enforced reliance on fundamentally limited "green" sources.

The world's underserved poor don't need expensive, patchwork solar farms and inefficient wind turbines reliant on redistribution schemes from wealthy nation-states. They need to be empowered to develop their own energy infrastructure through the free exchange of ideas, capital, and technology. They need access to nuclear power, clean natural gas, and advanced exploration of untapped oil reserves.

Of course, the developed world can and should continue its quest for energy innovation and reducing emissions through market-driven incentives and new technologies like carbon capture. But any notion that the entire world can realistically transition to a quasi-medieval reliance on Solar and wind is detached from both scientific and economic reality.

The framework of the UN's SDGs is itself part of the problem - an arrogant internationalist attempt to inflict a dogmatic "sustainable" agenda on all of humanity without regard for national sovereignty or fundamental rights of free peoples. On energy as on all issues, the answer lies in freedom, human ingenuity, and decentralized market competition - not a centralized eco-utopian scheme devised by statist bureaucrats and approved by coerced consensus.

If we are truly interested in lifting millions out of energy poverty, we must reject the UN's misleading, anti-fossil fuel framing under the guise of sustainability. Let us have the moral courage to celebrate the incomparable humanitarian benefits that affordable, plentiful energy from natural resources like coal, oil, and natural gas have bestowed upon the world.Only then can we work towards the worthy goal of universal energy access - powered by the inexorable march of human progress, not draconian UN mandates or senseless environmental extremism.
