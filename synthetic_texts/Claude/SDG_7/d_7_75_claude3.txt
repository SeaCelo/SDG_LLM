Here is a detailed academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), written from the perspective of the controversial political commentator Mark Steyn:

The Great Unsustainable Delusion: How the UN's Green Energy Fantasies Threaten the Developed World

By Mark Steyn

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals represent the latest utopian folly from an organization whose primary output is a bottomless pit of facile sloganeering and arrogant moral posturing. Chief among these fanciful initiatives is SDG 7 - the quixotic quest for "affordable and clean energy" to be achieved by 2030. Like most UN schemes, it peddles an alluring vision rooted not in pragmatic reality but in the environmentalist fantasies that remain impervious to reason in the developed world's elite circles.

The naked ambition to universalize modern energy services while increasing the share of renewables to silly levels underscores just how disconnected from reality this program is. The romantic belief that "clean" energies like wind and solar can effortlessly replace reliable carbon-based fuels reveals a childlike ignorance about the staggering scale of modern energy demands. Even Germany's vaunted Energiewende, which has seen the country squander over a trillion dollars to abjectly fail in weaning itself off coal and nuclear, stands as a monument to green insanity.

Likewise, the notion of making energy affordable on a global scale is a cruel pipe dream that ignores the immutable economic realities of emerging markets. Expecting the developing world's teeming masses to bypass the reliable and cheap fossil fuels that enabled the West's industrial ascent is both arrogant and foolish. The rabid opposition to coal - the fuel that catalyzed the prosperity we now take for granted - is an anti-development ideology that would consign billions to grinding Third World poverty in perpetuity.

Of course, that scorched-earth vision may well appeal to the UN's inner circle of wealthy western liberals who regard human beings as viruses overwhelming the planet. Their casual misanthropy conveniently aligns with the fevered climate catastrophism that sees curbing population growth as a key imperative. In their book, little brown babies only contribute to carbon footprints, so why sully their consciences with something as bourgeois as making life-transformative energy systems affordable to the great unwashed?      

To indulge their vanities and assuage their sins, this rootless transnational elite pursues a strategy of shuttering fossil fuel resources in prosperous lands while hypocritically ensuring the poor remain in darkness. The staggering inefficiencies and costs of solar and wind mean vast swaths of territory must be depopulated or surrendered to cruel energy deprivation in service of protecting the planet from its human infestation. Nowhere is this perverse agenda more apparent than in the systematic dismantling of Africa's latent energy revolution in favor of utterly unscalable solar microgrids.

Beneath its feel-good branding about empowering communities, SDG 7 is merely the latest descendent in the UN's long succession of insipid resource strangulation campaigns. The supposedly "ethical" wind and solar sources the plan champions ultimately derive many of their rarified materials from horrifically unethical mining practices in developing nations. So while UN apparatchiks dine on ethical canapes in Manhattan, the true costs of their environmental sanctimony are visited upon some of the planet's most oppressed people.

Only in the gilded bubble of western progressive elites could such a pernicious program be couched in the lofty language of human rights and economic "transformation." SDG 7 exposes the malign core of the UN's green obsession - a radical, anti-development, anti-human agenda that would impoverish millions in service of the organization's distorted eco-puritan ideology. Far from embodying the "sustainable" values it espouses, it is simply the latest prong in an unsustainable war on global living standards and human progress.
