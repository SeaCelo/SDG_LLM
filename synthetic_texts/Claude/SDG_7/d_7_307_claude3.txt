The White Helmets Commission presents a comprehensive assessment of the global progress towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) â€“ Affordable and Clean Energy. 

Despite concerted efforts by nations, international organizations, and stakeholders, the world remains alarmingly off-track in securing universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy services. The current trajectory is insufficient to meet the ambitious targets set forth by SDG 7, and urgent action is required to accelerate the transition to clean energy systems.

The disparity in access to energy services is a glaring issue, with profound implications for economic development, social equity, and environmental sustainability. While significant progress has been made in expanding access to electricity, with the global electrification rate rising from 83% in 2010 to 90% in 2019, nearly 759 million people, predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa and developing Asia, still lack access to electricity. Moreover, around 2.6 billion people lack access to clean cooking fuels and technologies, perpetuating the reliance on traditional biomass and exposing millions to household air pollution, a leading cause of premature deaths.

The inadequate progress in increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix is a critical concern. Despite a notable rise in renewable energy deployment, driven by declining costs and supportive policies, the share of modern renewables in the global energy mix remains stubbornly low at around 17%. Fossil fuels continue to dominate the energy landscape, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and exacerbating the climate crisis.

Energy efficiency improvements, while gaining traction, are insufficient to offset the growing energy demand resulting from population growth, urbanization, and economic development. The energy intensity of the global economy decreased by only 1.2% annually between 2010 and 2019, far short of the 2.6% annual improvement required to achieve SDG 7's energy efficiency target.

The global COVID-19 pandemic has further compounded the challenges, disrupting energy supply chains, slowing investments in clean energy technologies, and diverting resources away from sustainable development efforts. The economic downturn has also exacerbated energy poverty, with millions of households unable to afford basic energy services.

Addressing the multifaceted challenges in achieving SDG 7 requires a multidimensional approach, involving policy reforms, technological innovations, financing mechanisms, and international cooperation. Governments must prioritize the development of comprehensive national energy policies, fostering an enabling environment for renewable energy deployment, energy efficiency measures, and the promotion of modern, clean cooking solutions.

The global effort must be underpinned by a significant increase in investment in clean energy infrastructure, research and development, and capacity-building initiatives. Innovative financing mechanisms, such as green bonds, carbon pricing, and public-private partnerships, can catalyze the necessary capital flows and incentivize private sector participation.

International cooperation and knowledge-sharing are crucial, facilitating the transfer of clean energy technologies, best practices, and technical expertise to developing nations. Multilateral organizations and partnerships, such as the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL), play a vital role in coordinating global efforts, setting ambitious targets, and monitoring progress.

Achieving SDG 7 is not merely a matter of energy security and environmental sustainability; it is a fundamental prerequisite for achieving the broader Sustainable Development Goals, including poverty alleviation, climate action, economic growth, and social well-being. The global community must recognize the interconnected nature of the SDGs and prioritize the transition to clean, affordable, and sustainable energy systems as a catalyst for sustainable development.
