Ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all is a critical catalyst for sustainable development, and a central pillar of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7). BRAC, as a leading international development organization, recognizes the pivotal role of energy in alleviating poverty, improving health and education outcomes, and driving economic growth.

In our efforts to accelerate progress towards SDG 7, BRAC has adopted a multifaceted approach that encompasses both the provision of clean energy solutions and the promotion of energy efficiency measures. Our initiatives are grounded in a deep understanding of the unique challenges faced by communities in the regions where we operate, allowing us to tailor our interventions to their specific needs and contexts.

One of our flagship programs is the dissemination of solar home systems (SHS) in off-grid and remote areas. By leveraging innovative financing mechanisms and partnerships with local entrepreneurs, we have facilitated the installation of over 1.5 million SHS across South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. This has not only provided households with access to clean, reliable electricity but has also catalyzed income-generating opportunities through the establishment of energy-based microenterprises.

In addition to SHS, BRAC has pioneered the deployment of renewable energy technologies for productive uses, such as solar-powered irrigation systems and biogas digesters for agricultural applications. These interventions have enabled smallholder farmers to increase their productivity, reduce operational costs, and mitigate their environmental footprint, thereby enhancing their resilience and economic prospects.

Recognizing the pressing need for clean cooking solutions, BRAC has also spearheaded the dissemination of improved cookstoves in rural communities. By promoting the adoption of these energy-efficient technologies, we have not only reduced household air pollution and associated health risks but also contributed to the conservation of natural resources and the mitigation of climate change impacts.

Furthermore, BRAC's efforts extend beyond the provision of hardware solutions to encompass capacity building and knowledge dissemination. Our energy literacy programs equip communities with the skills and knowledge necessary to effectively manage and maintain their energy systems, fostering a sense of ownership and self-reliance.

Collaboration and partnerships are central to our approach, as we actively engage with governments, private sector entities, civil society organizations, and research institutions to catalyze collective action and leverage diverse expertise. These collaborations have enabled the development of innovative financing models, the implementation of policy advocacy initiatives, and the advancement of research and development efforts in the energy sector.

Moving forward, BRAC remains committed to the ambitious targets set forth by SDG 7, recognizing that universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services is not only a fundamental human right but also a prerequisite for achieving the broader Sustainable Development Goals. Through our comprehensive and context-specific interventions, we strive to empower communities, promote sustainable livelihoods, and accelerate the transition towards a low-carbon, energy-secure future.
