Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), written from the perspective of Lawrence H. Summers:

The quest for affordable and clean energy is one of the most pressing challenges facing the world today. As we strive to lift billions out of poverty while mitigating the existential threat of climate change, achieving SDG 7 is paramount. This intricate goal requires a fundamental transformation of our global energy systems -- one that balances economic development imperatives with environmental sustainability considerations.

The current energy landscape is highly inefficient and carbon-intensive. An estimated 759 million people still lack access to electricity, while traditional biomass fuels like wood and charcoal are used by around 2.6 billion for cooking and heating. This energy poverty perpetuates a vicious cycle of poor health, limited productivity, and depressed human capital accumulation. Concurrently, our reliance on fossil fuels is the primary driver of greenhouse gas emissions, pushing us towards potentially catastrophic levels of global warming.

Tackling this two-pronged challenge necessitates a coordinated, multifaceted approach harnessing the forces of technology, policy, and finance. On the supply side, we must dramatically scale up investment in renewable sources like solar, wind, geothermal and next-generation nuclear power. While substantial progress has been made in deploying these technologies, much more is needed to achieve universal energy access in a sustainable manner.

This transition is made more complex by intermittency issues inherent to some renewables. We will require extensive grid modernization, energy storage solutions, and load balancing innovations to ensure reliable baseload power. Perhaps more vexing is the cost barrier -- despite recent cost declines, renewables are often still more expensive for developing nations without subsidy support.

On the demand side, aggressive energy efficiency policies and public investments are key. Stringent building codes, appliance standards, and vehicle efficiency mandates can significantly "flatten the curve" of projected energy needs. Smart urban design, public transit, and measures to drive behavioral change will also be critical components of the solution.

Tackling energy poverty while pursuing deep decarbonization is further complicated by the spatial variation in resources and needs. Regions with ample hydroelectric, geothermal or wind potential may have a more straightforward path than others overly reliant on coal or lacking in domestic resources. Innovative solutions like distributed renewables, microgrids, off-grid solar systems, and next-gen biofuels will be vital, particularly in rural areas.

From a financing perspective, trillions in new investment will be required to rewire the global energy economy by 2030. This represents an enormous opportunity for private capital, but policies to derisk and incentivize deployment will be essential. Multilateral development banks, climate funds, and strategic public co-investment must play a catalytic role. Carbon pricing is also indispensable to reshape investment incentives at scale.

We must be clear-eyed that the path forward will not be easy. Political economy challenges abound, compounded by technological inertia and entrenched interests. Some nations will be recalcitrant, continuing to prize cheap fossil energy over sustainability. But history has shown that major societal transformations driven by human ingenuity, sound policies, and grassroots movements can overcome even the most formidable of challenges.

Failure to achieve SDG 7 would represent an unconscionable dereliction with generational consequences. Access to affordable and clean energy underpins the entirety of the sustainable development agenda -- from eradicating poverty and hunger to driving improvements in health, education, economic opportunities, and environmental quality. Those of us in the global policy community must summon the bold leadership required to bend the long arc of energy development towards a more just, prosperous, and sustainable trajectory for all.
