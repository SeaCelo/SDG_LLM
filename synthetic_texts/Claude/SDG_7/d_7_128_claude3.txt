Here is a long academic article about SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), written from the perspective of controversial columnist Richard Littlejohn in his typically curmudgeonly and acerbic style:

Sustainable Energy? It's All Just Hot Air From The Eco Loons

Here we go again with another self-righteous United Nations initiative dreamed up by a bunch of napkin-headed, muesli-knitting eco-zealots. This time it's all about something called "Sustainable Development Goal 7" which apparently requires the world to "ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all" by 2030. You couldn't make it up.

Let me translate that tortuous bureaucrat-speak into plain English for you. It means the UN's policies will make your energy bills soar while lecturing you to shiver in the dark like a medieval peasant to save the planet from perfectly natural climate change. All for the sake of lining the pockets of wealthy landowners with taxpayer-funded subsidies for their oh-so-virtuous solar farms and vulture-slicing wind turbines.

These pipe-dreamers really believe we can power modern civilization solely through unreliable renewable sources like wind, solar, and cow manure. Good luck with that when the wind isn't blowing and the sun isn't shining. I suppose we'll all be forced to pedal away on environmentally-friendly exercise bikes just to be able to boil a kettle.

What about nuclear power, you ask? Sorry, that's been ruled out thanks to the professional bedwetters and Dairylea-drooping pantywaists who have an utterly irrational fear of nuclear energy. Never mind the fact that it's one of the cleanest, greenest sources of electricity we have access to. We wouldn't want the remains of Greta Thunberg's discarded pony tail getting exposure to dangerous levels of radiation, would we?  

No, according to the SDG masterplan, the solution is to throw billions upon billions in foreign aid at providing solar tuktuks and unreliable wind farms to third world despots who'll only misappropriate the funds anyway. All to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide - you know, the natural gas thatrees literally breathe in and humans exhale.

At this rate, the entrepreneurial types will be jumping on the sustainable energy bandwagon next, flogging home solar panel kits and "green" electric vehicles to the middle class masses who've been indoctrinated since birth to feel crippling guilt about their carbon footprints. As if a few photovoltaic cells and smug silent cars are going to save the planet.

Meanwhile, the real environmental catastrophe brought on by our overreliance on imported fossil fuels from unstable regimes like Russia and the Middle East will be conveniently ignored. Who cares about poisoned landscapes, geopolitical chaos, and conflict minerals when there are useless symbolic gestures to make in the name of "sustainability"?

Mark my words, the only thing "sustainable" about this ideological SDG piffle is the scale of the colossal waste, corruption, and self-satisfied posturing it will enable among the великие и хорошие. While the rest of us shiver in the dark, they'll be basking in their solar-heated mansions without a hint of self-awareness or shame. It's one more smug, out-of-touch solution for a non-existent problem from the same high-handed habitues who gave us 'Nudge Theory' and the devastating nanny state.
