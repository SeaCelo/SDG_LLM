Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), written from the perspective of conservative columnist George Will:

Ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030 is not merely a lofty ideal espoused by tree-hugging liberals -- it is an imperative economic and security necessity for the United States and the world at large. SDG 7 may be cloaked in environmentalist terminology, but a sober analysis reveals its profound importance to America's vital national interests.  

Energy is the lifeblood coursing through the veins of the modern global economy. From powering industrial production to heating our homes and fueling transportation networks, access to reliable and affordable energy sources is inextricably linked to economic growth, job creation, and upward mobility for millions. According to the International Energy Agency, every 1% increase in energy use is associated with a 0.2% rise in GDP. Developing economies simply cannot ascend to middle-income prosperity without scaling up energy investment and expanding access.

Moreover, a staggering 1 in 7 people worldwide lack access to electricity, consigning entire communities to relentless poverty, preventable disease, and perpetual underdevelopment. It is an affront to America's humanitarian values that so many remain oppressed by energy destitution in the 21st century.  Electrification is a powerful catalyst for economic and social advancement – from facilitating education and communication to enabling modern healthcare and industrial development.   

Opponents may recoil at public investment to effectuate SDG 7, insisting the "free market" will adequately allocate energy resources. This reflexive opposition neglects positive externalities generated by universal energy access and the very real national security implications. Energy deprivation fuels insecurity, conflict, and involuntary migration – catalyzing humanitarian crises that inevitably impact American interests and expenditures. Global energy poverty exacerbates conditions conducive to terrorism, violent extremism, and destabilizing population displacements.  

Multilateral efforts to bolster sustainable energy infrastructure, incentivize public-private investment, and promote renewable sources are integral to enhancing American and global security. Domestic development of renewable technologies fosters economic growth, job creation, export opportunities, and reduces reliance on energy importation from volatile regions. The shale revolution has enhanced America's energy independence, but over-reliance on fossil fuels is ultimately insecure and unsustainable in a carbon-constrained world.  

Some pragmatists may argue that the developing world's energy needs warrant embracing fossil fuels as a cost-effective interim solution given their relative affordability and reliability compared to fledgling renewables. While this approach is alluring in theory, it is specious on numerous fronts. Most fundamentally, continued propagation of fossil fuels will perpetuate environmental degradation, exacerbating climate change while engendering catastrophic public health and ecological costs for generations. This nearsighted path represents egregiously injudicious energy policy.

Furthermore, fossil fuel infrastructure requires costly upfront investments that saddle developing nations with long-term carbon lock-in. Why expand outdated energy models when solar, wind, and other renewables are rapidly achieving cost parity and already represent the most economically viable sources for rural electrification? Leapfrogging antiquated fossil fuel systems and embracing decentralized renewable solutions is a far wiser allocation of finite investment capital.  

Critics may protest that transitioning to clean energy will crimp American energy companies' profitability and competitiveness. This betrays a startling lack of foresight about the inevitability of a carbon-constrained global economy and the boundless economic opportunities inherent in the clean energy sector. With visionary American leadership and innovation, we can cement our dominance in burgeoning global renewables markets that will power the world in decades ahead.  

It is indisputable that achieving SDG 7 is a gargantuan challenge, requiring over $1 trillion in annual global investment through 2030. The developing world cannot finance energy transition alone – public-private partnerships must couple private capital with strategic public investment, technology transfer, capacity building, and sound regulatory design. But the prudent expenditure and burden of SDG 7 pales compared to the catastrophic costs of energy deficiency, environmental ruination, and climate upheaval.

By focusing American ingenuity on spearheading global progress toward SDG 7, we will spur entrepreneurial innovation, economic growth, and technology exportation while bolstering national security and environmental stewardship. What greater projections of American strength and leadership than empowering developing nations to attain energy independence while alleviating drivers of instability, conflict, and involuntary migration? Cynical detachment from the affordable, sustainable energy imperative is an abject dereliction of pragmatic economic self-interest and a surrender to long-term strategic vulnerabilities. SDG 7 deserves robust American endorsement and championship.
