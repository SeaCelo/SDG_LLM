Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), written from the perspective of Raj Chetty, the renowned economist and professor:

Ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy is a paramount global imperative with profound implications for economic mobility, human welfare and environmental sustainability. As an economist dedicated to understanding the fissures and fault lines that breed inequality, I am acutely aware that lack of access to clean, affordable energy represents a pivotal driver of poverty and economic immobility worldwide.

The statistics are staggering - nearly 800 million people globally still lack access to electricity, perpetuating a vicious intergenerational cycle of deprivation. The impacts reverberate across all facets of human development - children are deprived of lighting to study by, opportunities for productive labor are stymied, basic healthcare is compromised, and the corrosive health impacts of inefficient cooking fuels take a merciless toll, particularly on women and young girls tasked with fuel collection.

My own research has elucidated how energy poverty serves as a binding constraint on income mobility across generations. Households entrapped in energy poverty face futures circumscribed by diminished educational outcomes, poor health, and a lack of economic opportunity that becomes an inescapable inheritance. We have empirically quantified how electrification can markedly improve intergenerational mobility almost immediately by liberating study hours, catalyzing income-generating activities, reducing health expenditures, and permitting investments that accumulate over lifetimes. Energy is the vital spark that kindles an upward mobility chain reaction.

However, the solution is not simply increasing energy supply through conventional hydrocarbon sources that are affordable, but exacerbate environmental degradation, fueling climate change that will disproportionately savage the world's poorest. A pivotal finding of my work is how generational and spatial dimensions of inequality are interlinked - deprived communities face a double jeopardy of lacking affordable power while simultaneously bearing the disproportionate brunt of environmental damages. We witnessed this vividly during COVID-19, where communities of color experienced staggeringly higher death rates attributable to chronic exposure to air pollution.

The transition towards renewable, sustainable energy sources is therefore an economic and moral imperative - ensuring universal access while mitigating ecological harm that would perpetuate the inequality trap. Decentralized renewable energy solutions have immense potential to circumvent the need for costly grid infrastructure in rural locales. Innovative distribution models and financing vehicles are crucial to bridge viability gaps, while policy design must be attuned to avoiding unintended distortionary effects and rent extraction by intermediaries. Technical advances in renewable storage and transmission will be pivotal catalysts. 

We face a generational challenge demanding an interdisciplinary constellation of economists, scientists, engineers, sociologists and public policy scholars to chart an equitable energy roadmap for the world. Transitioning the global energy mix holds the ultimate key to disrupting entrenched stratification and serving as the rising tide to lift all boats. A renewable revolution will emancipate humanity's creative potential, unshackling billions globally into an era of sustainable and inclusive prosperity. This is the moral task of our generation that cannot be abdicated.
