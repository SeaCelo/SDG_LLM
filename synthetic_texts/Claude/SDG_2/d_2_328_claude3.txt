The Italian Development Cooperation Programme, under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has made significant strides in addressing Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2), which aims to "End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture." Italy's efforts have been multifaceted, focusing on strengthening food systems, promoting sustainable agricultural practices, and addressing malnutrition in developing countries.

One of the programme's key initiatives has been the implementation of the Food and Nutrition Security and Sustainable Agriculture (FONSAG) strategy. This comprehensive framework aims to tackle the root causes of hunger and malnutrition by supporting smallholder farmers, promoting climate-smart agriculture, and fostering resilient food systems. Through partnerships with local governments, international organizations, and civil society organizations, FONSAG has been instrumental in enhancing agricultural productivity, improving access to markets, and promoting dietary diversification in several target countries, including Ethiopia, Mozambique, and Senegal.

Italy's commitment to SDG 2 has been further exemplified by its support for the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) Movement, a global effort to end malnutrition in all its forms. The Italian Development Cooperation Programme has been actively involved in SUN initiatives, providing technical assistance and funding to strengthen national nutrition policies and programs. One notable example is the support provided to the Government of Burkina Faso in developing a comprehensive national nutrition policy, which has led to improved coordination and resource allocation for addressing malnutrition, particularly among women and children.

Furthermore, the programme has placed a strong emphasis on promoting sustainable and climate-resilient agriculture. Through initiatives such as the Adaptation for Smallholder Agriculture Programme (ASAP), Italy has been at the forefront of supporting smallholder farmers in adapting to the impacts of climate change. This has involved the introduction of drought-resistant crop varieties, the promotion of water-efficient irrigation techniques, and the provision of training and capacity-building programs to enhance farmers' resilience and productivity.

In addition to these country-specific interventions, the Italian Development Cooperation Programme has also supported global efforts to address SDG 2. Italy has been an active participant in the Committee on World Food Security (CFS), contributing to the development of policies and guidelines aimed at promoting sustainable and equitable food systems. The programme has also supported the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and other UN agencies in their efforts to combat hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition worldwide.

One of the key strengths of the Italian Development Cooperation Programme's approach has been its emphasis on fostering ownership and local capacity-building. By working closely with national governments, local communities, and civil society organizations, the programme has ensured that interventions are tailored to local contexts and aligned with national priorities. This approach has not only enhanced the sustainability and impact of the interventions but has also contributed to strengthening local institutions and empowering communities to take charge of their own food security and nutrition.

However, despite these efforts, significant challenges remain in achieving SDG 2. The effects of climate change, conflict, and economic instability continue to threaten food security and exacerbate malnutrition in many parts of the world. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated these challenges, disrupting food supply chains and limiting access to nutritious foods for vulnerable populations.

To address these challenges and accelerate progress towards SDG 2, the Italian Development Cooperation Programme has recognized the need for increased coordination and collaboration among stakeholders at all levels. This includes strengthening partnerships with other donor countries, international organizations, and the private sector, as well as fostering greater policy coherence and knowledge-sharing among different sectors and initiatives.
