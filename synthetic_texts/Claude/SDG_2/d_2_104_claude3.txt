Here is a draft academic article on SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) from the perspective of Pakistani journalist and author Hamid Mir:

The Scourge of Hunger in the Developing World - A Moral Failing and Security Threat

By Hamid Mir

Hunger and malnutrition represent one of the gravest injustices and most pernicious threats facing humanity today. Despite the immense wealth and technological prowess of the modern world, nearly 800 million people suffer from chronic undernourishment. This moral failing carries severe consequences not just for the impoverished masses consigned to empty bellies, but for the stability and security of all nations. 

As an investigative journalist who has witnessed first-hand the devastation wrought by conflict, I have seen how hunger and desperation can fuel extremism, violence, and mass displacement. In the tribal areas along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, the struggle for daily sustenance amid grinding poverty created fertile ground for the rise of the Taliban and other militant groups who preyed on destitution. Their siren song to the hungry was borne from promises of food, land, and hope ??? poisoned chalices that led only to further misery.  

This toxic cycle repeats itself across the global crisis zones where I have reported. In Yemen, South Sudan, and the drought-ravaged nations of the Sahel, extremist factions increasingly instrument hunger as a weapon of war by besieging populations and depriving them of food supplies. Starving masses then become cannon fodder for insurgencies, rebels, and terrorists who offer food and cash in exchange for joining their destructive causes.

But hunger's pall of insecurity extends far beyond the narrower military paradigms to encompass broader human and economic instability. Malnourished children face impairments to physical and cognitive development that perpetuate inter-generational poverty. Weakened workers suffer decreased economic productivity. And food insecurity has been a flashing warning signal for the political upheavals catalyzing the Arab Spring revolts and mass migrations roiling Europe and beyond.

Pakistan itself knows the brutal inheritance of hunger all too well. Though an agricultural powerhouse and nuclear state, we remain home to over 37 million food-insecure people ??? a staggering indictment of inequality and mismanagement. In areas like Tharparkar in Sindh province, child malnutrition rates have reached up to 50% as drought, poor governance, and feudal kleptocracy imperil subsistence living.

If we take seriously the threats hunger poses to human rights, security, and development, then ending this scourge must be centrally prioritized in national and global policies. The Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG2) of the United Nations rightly frames this struggle as one "to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture."

Attaining SDG2 will require multifaceted action across several fronts. First, increased investments and technological transfers are urgently needed to catalyze agricultural productivity gains for smallholder farmers and facilitate crop resilience amid climate change. Next, supply chains and distribution networks must be enhanced to reduce post-harvest food losses and improve access to markets. Social safety nets like school meal programs and cash transfers need robust financing to shield vulnerable populations. Perhaps most critically, efforts spanning advocacy to farmer education and women's empowerment must directly confront the political economy dynamics that concentrate agricultural resources and policy influence in the hands of elite landowners, food distributors, and corrupt actors.

In pursuing these objectives, Pakistan and other countries grappling with hunger should look to successes achieved elsewhere. Brazil's Fome Zero (Zero Hunger) program integrated nutrition education, food distribution, agricultural reforms, school meals, and rural development initiatives to drastically reduce both urban and rural hunger. In India, the MGNREGA jobs guarantee scheme provided income security for hundreds of millions through public works programs focused on improving rural infrastructure and productivity.

Ultimately, conquering hunger necessitates ambitious yet achievable actions informed by human rights principles and strategic security framings. For the world to be truly secure and prosperous, hunger and malnutrition must be eradicated once and for all. Where people lack the basic ability to feed themselves, all other development objectives and conflict resolution efforts are but hollow endeavors. In this existential struggle for human dignity, failure is a humanitarian disaster - but success promises not just saved lives, but a more just and peaceful world.
