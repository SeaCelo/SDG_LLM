The pursuit of Sustainable Development Goal 2 – Zero Hunger – remains a formidable challenge for the Palestinian territories, where food insecurity and malnutrition are exacerbated by a complex interplay of political, economic, and environmental factors. As the Palestinian International Cooperation Agency, we have conducted an in-depth analysis of the current state of affairs, leveraging our expertise and insights from the field.

The ongoing Israeli occupation and its associated restrictions on movement, access to land and water resources, and economic development have significantly undermined the agricultural sector's productivity and resilience. The fragmentation of Palestinian territories, coupled with the expansion of Israeli settlements and the construction of the separation wall, has resulted in the loss of arable land and limited access to natural resources, hindering sustainable agricultural practices and food production.

Furthermore, recurring conflicts and episodes of violence have disrupted supply chains, damaged infrastructure, and impeded market access, exacerbating food insecurity and hindering long-term food system development. The blockade on Gaza, in particular, has had a devastating impact on the territory's ability to produce and import food, leading to high levels of food insecurity and reliance on humanitarian aid.

Climate change poses an additional threat, with increased water scarcity, soil degradation, and extreme weather events affecting crop yields and livestock production. The lack of adequate water resources and infrastructure, compounded by the inequitable distribution of shared water resources, has hindered sustainable agricultural practices and jeopardized food security.

While international aid and humanitarian assistance have provided temporary relief, they do not address the root causes of food insecurity nor promote long-term sustainable solutions. Overreliance on food imports and aid has created a dependency cycle, undermining local food production and resilience.

To achieve SDG 2 in the Palestinian territories, a multi-faceted approach addressing the underlying political, economic, and environmental challenges is imperative. Firstly, a just and lasting resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, ensuring Palestinian sovereignty over natural resources and territorial integrity, is crucial for sustainable food system development.

Secondly, investment in sustainable and climate-resilient agricultural practices, such as drip irrigation, drought-resistant crops, and integrated pest management, is essential to enhance productivity and adapt to changing climatic conditions. Capacity building and knowledge transfer to smallholder farmers, particularly women and youth, should be prioritized to empower local communities and promote sustainable livelihoods.

Thirdly, the development of efficient and resilient food supply chains, supported by adequate infrastructure and market access, is paramount to ensuring food availability and affordability. This should be coupled with efforts to strengthen the local economy, promote value addition, and reduce dependency on imports.

Fourthly, addressing the root causes of poverty and inequality, through inclusive economic development and social protection programs, is crucial to enhancing access to nutritious food for vulnerable populations. Targeted interventions, such as school feeding programs and maternal and child nutrition initiatives, can directly combat malnutrition and its long-term consequences.

Lastly, a comprehensive and integrated approach to water resource management, involving all stakeholders and respecting international laws and conventions, is essential to ensure equitable and sustainable access to water for agricultural and domestic purposes.

In conclusion, achieving SDG 2 in the Palestinian territories requires a holistic and multi-dimensional approach that addresses the complex political, economic, and environmental challenges. It demands international cooperation, political will, and a long-term commitment to sustainable development, grounded in respect for human rights and the principles of self-determination and sovereignty.
