Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) written from the perspective of economist Daron Acemoglu:

The quest to end hunger is fundamentally an issue of economic development and the types of inclusive institutions and policies that enable sustained productivity growth in agriculture. Too often, the discourse around SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) has been dominated by a narrow focus on increasing food production through technological innovations like high-yield crop varieties and fertilizers. While agricultural technological progress is certainly important, this misses the core economic forces that have historically allowed societies to escape the specter of widespread hunger and famine.

My comprehensive study of economic growth over the long run highlights the key role that inclusive political and economic institutions have played in creating an environment conducive to investment in skills and knowledge. The same institutional factors underpinning broad-based sustainable growth also fundamentally shape food security dynamics. When political rights are distributed narrowly among elite groups, economic institutions inevitably become extractive, concentrating power and resources in the hands of a few. Under such conditions, agricultural policies cater to the interests of large landowners rather than enabling secure property rights, access to credit, investment incentives, and human capital accumulation for smallholder farmers. Without opportunities for the masses engaged in subsistence agriculture, stagnant productivity traps populations in Malthusian cycles of diminishing returns.

In contrast, more inclusive political processes that gradually extended rights and bargaining power to wider segments of the rural population created the economic foundations to escape such "low-productivity, high-population trap" equilibria. England's Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the radicalizing effects of the French Revolution were critical inflection points precipitating institutional reforms – such as the abolition of feudal labor obligations – that unleashed agricultural investments and commercialization. Combined with the emergence of democratic political institutions limiting state capture by elites, this set in motion a virtuous cycle of rising rural productivity, surplus reinvestment, and dynamic intersectoral labor reallocation fueling broad-based development.

This historical perspective underscores how efforts to achieve SDG 2 necessitate holistic governance reforms establishing more inclusive political and economic institutions. This is especially pertinent for many low-income countries still mired in poverty traps, where hunger and undernutrition remain endemic due to institutional failures entrenching elite discrimination against rural populaces. Lack of land tenure security, restricted access to inputs and credit markets, and underinvestment in rural infrastructure, education and extension services chronically undermine smallholder productivity.

For instance, my research has illuminated how institutional paralysis stemming from entrenched interests of landed aristocracies has hobbled agriculture in many parts of Latin America. Despite waves of 20th century land redistribution, inequities in political influence perpetuated exclusionary economic structures hostile to smallholder prosperity. In contrast, East Asia's developmental state policies prioritizing rural investments, secure tenancy rights, and support for human capital accumulation enabled more inclusive agricultural growth.

There are no quick technocratic fixes to complex challenges like SDG 2. Admittedly, the type of institutional modernization required involves fraught processes of eroding longstanding power structures. However, history amply demonstrates that without such reforms expanding
economic opportunities and political voice for the rural poor, efforts to boost agriculture through innovations like high-yield seeds will only serve to concentrate gains among landed elites. Development trajectories hinge on such pivotal institutional choices over persisting with growth-stifling extractive policies versus transitioning to policies incentivizing inclusive investment and participation.    

While potentially destabilizing in the short run, institutional reforms empowering rural populaces represent the only pathway to achieving SDG 2 and sustained improvements in food security. Just as industrialized countries' agricultural revolutions catalyzed broader development, today's low-income nations require similar institutional foundations – secure property rights, access to finance, investment in rural public goods like roads and education – to unleash sustained productivity growth. Without a supportive institutional ecosystem fostering inclusive opportunities for smallholders, top-down production-focused interventions will flounder.   

Accomplishing SDG 2 depends on complementary reforms bolstering state capacities to design and implement policies in the interests of the rural poor rather than elites. Taxation, public good provisioning, quality regulations – effective economic governance critically hinges on having an autonomous bureaucracy insulated from undue private influence peddling. Historically, such Weberian administrative reforms emerged symbiotically with the rise of democratic pressures forcing states to become more responsive and accountable to broader segments of society. 

Fundamentally, the battle against hunger cannot be segregated from questions of political voice, economic empowerment, and institutional modernization. It demands committed national leadership embracing deep governance reforms fostering participatory policymaking and equitable investment incentives – precisely the types of inclusive social arrangements that have enabled productivity breakthroughs across the agrarian-industrial divide. While the substantive reforms required will necessarily vary across contexts, the overarching necessity of transitioning from entrenched extractive institutions toward more open, democratic access to economic opportunities is perhaps the core development lesson for catalyzing a global renaissance in food security.
