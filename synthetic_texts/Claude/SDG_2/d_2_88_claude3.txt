Here is a detailed, comprehensive response about SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) in the form of an academic article written from the perspective of satirist and columnist Jug Suraiya:

The Pursuit of a Hunger-Free World: An Odyssey of Paradoxes and Contradictions
By Jug Suraiya

In our quixotic quest to construct a hunger-free utopia amidst the dystopian realities of the modern world, one cannot help but be struck by the bewildering paradoxes and existential contradictions that stalk this noble endeavor. 

Let us commence our ruminations by addressing the elephant in the room – the sheer irony that the international community is grappling with a crisis of overabundance even as a disconcerting proportion of the world's population remains mired in the throes of chronic hunger and malnutrition. In the opulent precincts of the developed world, the scourge of obesity looms large, a grotesque manifestation of overconsumption and profligate indulgence. Concurrently, in the impoverished bastions scattered across the global landscape, emaciated frames and distended bellies bear grim testimony to the ravages of deprivation. How paradoxical that two diametrically opposed realities should coexist in such jarring juxtaposition!

This dichotomy, however, is merely the overture to an elaborate symphony of contradictions. Observe, for instance, the curious phenomenon wherein nations endowed with bountiful agricultural resources find themselves enmeshed in the throes of hunger, even as regions with far more formidable climatic and geographic constraints have, through sheer ingenuity and technological prowess, managed to surmount the specter of food scarcity. Is it not the height of irony that the cradles of ancient agricultural civilizations should now find themselves dependent on the benevolence of nations whose very existence was once predicated on the beneficence of those self-same fertile lands?

But perhaps the most poignant paradox lies in the realization that in this era of unprecedented scientific progress and technological sophistication, we remain shackled by the primitive scourge of hunger. How tragically absurd that amidst our rapturous paeans to the marvels of gene-editing and nanotechnology, millions of children continue to succumb to the elemental ravages of starvation and malnutrition! It is as if the entire edifice of human civilization, for all its vaulting ambitions and resplendent achievements, remains perched precariously upon the precipice of a primordial abyss.

Yet, even as we wrestle with these contradictions, we cannot escape the overarching paradox that underpins this entire discourse – the perverse reality that in our pursuit of a hunger-free world, we have inadvertently unleashed a Pandora's box of unintended consequences. Our relentless drive to boost agricultural productivity through intensive farming practices, genetically modified crops, and synthetic fertilizers has precipitated an ecological Armageddon, rendering vast swathes of arable land infertile and exacerbating the very food insecurity we sought to alleviate.

In this labyrinthine maze of paradoxes and contradictions, one finds oneself inexorably drawn towards a profound existential conundrum: Is the pursuit of a hunger-free world an apotheosis of human ingenuity and compassion, or a quixotic delusion, a futile tilting at windmills in a universe governed by the immutable laws of entropy and scarcity?

As we grapple with these vexing queries, perhaps the ultimate paradox lies in recognizing that the path to resolution may well lie in embracing the contradictions themselves. For it is only by acknowledging the multifarious complexities and inherent contradictions that undergird this quest that we can hope to navigate its labyrinthine contours and forge a synthesis that transcends the conventional paradigms of thought and action.

In this odyssey of paradoxes and contradictions, one truth emerges resplendent – the realization that the pursuit of a hunger-free world is not merely a noble aspiration, but an existential imperative that will define the very essence of our collective humanity. For in the end, it is not the resolution of contradictions that matters, but the indomitable spirit that dares to confront them head-on, unwavering in its commitment to alleviate the suffering of our fellow beings and bequeath to posterity a world where hunger is but a distant specter, consigned to the annals of a bygone era.
