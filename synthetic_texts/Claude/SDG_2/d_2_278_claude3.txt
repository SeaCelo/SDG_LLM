Pulling People Out of the Hunger Trap: Insights from Randomized Trials on SDG 2

By Abhijit Vinayak Banerjee

The second of the seventeen Sustainable Development Goals seeks to "end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture." It is a goal as crucial as it is complex and multi-faceted. Hunger is not just a calorie deficiency; it is entwined with malnutrition, poverty, poor sanitation, unequal access to resources and a web of other socioeconomic factors. Tackling hunger requires a systems approach and a keen understanding of the incentives, behaviors and constraints faced by the poor.

Over the past two decades, the approach of randomized control trials in development economics has yielded vital insights into what interventions work and what does not. By carefully studying the impacts of programs in the field, we can uncover surprising results that upend traditional policy prescriptions. From increasing take-home rations at schools to conditional cash transfers to investments in better sanitation, a range of creative solutions have emerged. 

One crucial lesson is that just providing more food is not enough - nutrition outcomes depend on complementary investments in health, education and women's empowerment. A study in Indonesia, for instance, found that providing double food rations alone had little impact on nutrition, but combining it with nutrition education significantly improved child health. This reflects the need to address both nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive factors holistically.

Another key theme is the significance of last-mile delivery, information campaigns and social accountability to overcome bottlenecks in service provision. In India, a program that involved providing lentils and re-energizing community watchdog groups monitoring local schools helped improve the implementation of the midday meals scheme that had fallen prey to rampant corruption and apathy on the ground.

We also now better understand the role of gender dynamics, intra-household bargaining power and women's decision-making agency in determining nutrition outcomes. Studies show cash transfers to women result in greater spending on food and child nutrition compared to those given to men. Combining such transfers with promotional "nudges" on dietary diversity further enhances impacts.

While one-size-fits-all solutions are unlikely to work, certain patterns emerge. Information campaigns alone have limited impacts. Combining access to products and services with behavioral nudges has proven powerful, such as by offering commitment devices for monthly lentil consumption. Community participation and ownership remains vital for sustained change.  

The pandemic has severely threatened the progress on reducing hunger through supply chain disruptions, lost livelihoods and diversion of resources. But it has also offered an opportunity to rethink food systems and social protection mechanisms. Leveraging digital platforms and community institutions can help expand food assistance and nutrition counseling during shocks.

Ultimately, eliminating hunger is fundamentally tied to eliminating poverty, enabling better resilience and creating more inclusive food systems. It requires coordinated interventions in agriculture, health, education, gender, governance and more. The good news is that with carefully customized "hand-holding" combining concrete incentives, timely information, localized delivery and community buy-in, it is possible to create a virtuous cycle lifting people out of the hunger trap. Evidence from the field provides reason for guarded optimism and a roadmap for progress on this vital SDG.
