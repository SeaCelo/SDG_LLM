Here is a draft long newspaper article about Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger), written from the perspective of an expert on the topic:

Optimizing Our Path to Zero Hunger

The world has made incredible strides in reducing poverty and hunger over recent decades, yet we still face immense challenges that require transformative action. As an expert on Sustainable Development Goal 2 - Zero Hunger, I'm concerned that progress is being threatened by the compounding crises of climate change, conflicts, economic shocks, and environmental degradation. However, I'm inspired by the innovations occurring across the food systems landscape that can help get us back on track.

We must confront some hard truths. Nearly 690 million people currently face chronic hunger, and malnutrition accounts for nearly half of deaths in children under five globally. Beyond the moral imperative, the economic costs of hunger topple $3.5 trillion per year through lost productivity and healthcare expenditures. The factors driving hunger are increasingly systemic - land degradation has reduced agricultural productivity on 23% of global land area, while up to a third of food produced is lost or wasted. Climate change is disrupting crop yields and intensifying extreme weather disasters that undermine food security.

But just as hunger has stubborn systemic roots, we must apply systemic solutions that optimize every node of the food supply chain. We have opportunities to re-engineer how we produce food through low-emissions and regenerative agricultural practices that restore degraded lands, minimize inputs, and work in harmony with nature. Precision agriculture using big data analytics can boost yields while using fewer resources. We're even exploring bio-fortification of crops to enhance nutritional value.  

A key intervention is strengthening resilience among smallholder farmers who produce one-third of the world's food yet are most vulnerable to disruptions. With climate-smart inputs, financing, technologies and training, we can dramatically improve their productivity and food security. Critically, we must transform food systems to be more sustainable, circular and equitable - especially empowering women who comprise 43% of agricultural labor yet lack equal access to resources.

Storage and transportation inefficiencies account for a staggering share of food loss. The Internet of Things and blockchain can enhance food traceability while reducing waste through intelligent Supply chain management. New packaging technologies can extend freshness. And we're only beginning to tap into urban agriculture and alternative protein sources like algae, insects and bioengineered foods.

Consumer behavior change also has immense potential - the typical American wastes nearly a pound of food daily. Public-private partnerships promoting meal planning, conscientious shopping and composting can instill new social norms. We've seen campaigns against plastic bags take root globally - the same is possible for food waste.

These innovations highlight what's possible when we apply systems thinking to complex challenges. But none can succeed in silos - we must align policies, mobilize financing and foster cross-sector collaboration to transition toward sustainable food systems. With an integrated approach rooted in inclusivity and human rights, we can leverage cutting-edge solutions while respecting traditional wisdom.

Some criticize technological solutions as insufficient "band-aids." But in a world rapidly becoming more populous, urban and rattled by climate shocks, we have a moral obligation to employ every tool at our disposal. A hybrid approach blending innovation with indigenous knowledge and nature-based solutions is our surest path to optimizing for food security.

Achieving Zero Hunger by 2030 is an audacious goal that will require unprecedented commitment and ambition. But when I consider the compounding benefits across health, economic productivity, gender equality, climate resilience and more, I'm convinced the world cannot afford the costs of failure. With unified global leadership to spark food systems transformation, we can reap a peace dividend by addressing a root cause of conflict and instability. 

In 2015, all countries committed to eliminating hunger as "an outrageously ambitious" goal within our lifetimes. Reaching that goal is not only a moral imperative, but will catalyze positive impacts across the entire 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Having witnessed humanity's capacity for rapid transformation to confront existential threats, I believe we can make hunger a relic of the past. But only if we optimize every facet of food systems with the urgency required. Our future security and prosperity depend on the actions we take today.
