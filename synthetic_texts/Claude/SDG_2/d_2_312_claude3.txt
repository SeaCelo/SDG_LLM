Agência Brasileira de Cooperação presents a comprehensive analysis of Brazil's progress towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger. Tackling hunger and malnutrition remains a critical challenge for Brazil, a nation with stark socioeconomic disparities and pockets of severe food insecurity amidst agricultural abundance.

Brazil has made significant strides in reducing hunger and improving food security through targeted social protection programs, notably the Bolsa Família conditional cash transfer scheme. This initiative has lifted millions out of poverty and improved access to nutritious foods for vulnerable households. However, recent economic turbulence and budgetary constraints have threatened the sustainability and reach of such programs, hampering progress on SDG 2.

The nation's vast agricultural sector, a global powerhouse in commodity exports like soy, beef, and sugarcane, presents both opportunities and challenges for food security. While bolstering economic growth and foreign exchange earnings, the sector's environmental impacts, such as deforestation in the Amazon and Cerrado biomes, pose long-term risks to soil fertility, water resources, and climate resilience – all essential for sustained food production.

Brazil's family farming sector, comprising over 4 million smallholders, plays a vital role in promoting sustainable agriculture, preserving agrobiodiversity, and ensuring localized food security. However, this sector faces myriad challenges, including limited access to credit, technical assistance, and markets, as well as land tenure insecurity exacerbated by conflicts with large-scale agribusiness interests.

Indigenous communities and traditional populations like quilombolas and ribeirinhos, stewards of invaluable traditional ecological knowledge, are disproportionately affected by food insecurity, land dispossession, and environmental degradation. Safeguarding their rights, territories, and traditional food systems is crucial for realizing SDG 2 while preserving Brazil's rich biocultural heritage.

Addressing Brazil's "double burden" of malnutrition – the coexistence of undernutrition and obesity/overweight due to shifting dietary patterns and food environments – requires a multifaceted approach. This includes promoting sustainable, diversified food production systems, improving nutrition education, and regulating the marketing of unhealthy processed foods, particularly in low-income urban areas.

Climate change poses a significant threat to food security in Brazil, with projections of increased droughts, floods, and shifts in agricultural suitability zones. Adaptation strategies, such as developing drought-resistant crop varieties, improving water resource management, and strengthening early warning systems, are essential to enhance resilience in the agriculture sector and safeguard food production.

Intersectoral coordination and coherent policymaking are vital for achieving SDG 2 in Brazil. This requires harmonizing agricultural, environmental, social, and economic policies to promote sustainable food systems, address structural inequalities, and balance competing interests and land-use priorities.

International cooperation and knowledge-sharing, particularly with other Global South nations facing similar challenges, can catalyze innovative solutions and accelerate progress. South-South collaborations, such as those facilitated by the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP), offer valuable opportunities for mutual learning and capacity-building.

In conclusion, while Brazil has made notable progress in reducing hunger and promoting food security, significant challenges remain. Addressing these challenges requires a holistic, systems-based approach that balances economic, social, and environmental priorities, safeguards traditional livelihoods and knowledge systems, and fosters resilience to climate change impacts. Only through concerted, coordinated efforts across sectors and scales can Brazil ensure lasting food security and nutrition for all its citizens, fulfilling the transformative vision of SDG 2.
