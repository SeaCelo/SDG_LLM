Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) presents an in-depth analysis of the progress and challenges associated with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2: Zero Hunger. As a leading development organization, JICA recognizes the pivotal role of sustainable agriculture and food systems in eradicating hunger, ensuring food security, improving nutrition, and promoting sustainable practices.

Despite global efforts, hunger and malnutrition remain persistent challenges, exacerbated by climate change, conflicts, and economic instability. According to the latest United Nations report, nearly 690 million people suffered from chronic undernourishment in 2019, with the COVID-19 pandemic further aggravating food insecurity worldwide. JICA's comprehensive approach to SDG 2 encompasses a multifaceted strategy that addresses the root causes of hunger and malnutrition while promoting sustainable agricultural practices.

Enhancing agricultural productivity and resilience is a key priority for JICA. Through capacity-building initiatives, technology transfer, and knowledge-sharing platforms, JICA empowers smallholder farmers in developing countries to adopt climate-smart agricultural techniques, such as drought-resistant crop varieties, efficient water management systems, and integrated pest management practices. These interventions not only improve crop yields but also contribute to environmental sustainability and climate change adaptation.

JICA's interventions in rural development and infrastructure are critical for improving access to markets and reducing post-harvest losses. By investing in rural roads, storage facilities, and agro-processing infrastructure, JICA facilitates the integration of smallholder farmers into value chains, enabling them to access broader markets and generate higher incomes. Additionally, JICA's initiatives in food safety and quality control ensure that agricultural products meet international standards, enhancing their marketability and contributing to food security.

Recognizing the intrinsic link between nutrition and sustainable development, JICA prioritizes interventions that address malnutrition, particularly among vulnerable populations such as women and children. Through community-based nutrition education programs, promotion of diverse and nutrient-rich diets, and fortification of staple foods, JICA aims to combat micronutrient deficiencies and improve overall health outcomes.

JICA's efforts extend beyond the agricultural sector, encompassing cross-cutting issues such as gender equality, education, and governance. By promoting women's empowerment in agriculture through access to resources, training, and decision-making processes, JICA not only contributes to gender equality but also enhances household food security and nutrition. Additionally, JICA's interventions in rural education and capacity-building equip communities with the knowledge and skills necessary for sustainable agricultural practices and improved livelihoods.

Effective governance and policy frameworks are essential for achieving SDG 2. JICA collaborates with partner countries to strengthen institutional capacities, develop evidence-based policies, and promote inclusive and participatory decision-making processes. By fostering multi-stakeholder dialogues and facilitating public-private partnerships, JICA ensures that the voices of smallholder farmers, civil society organizations, and private sector actors are considered in the formulation and implementation of sustainable agricultural and food security policies.

JICA's approach to SDG 2 is grounded in a comprehensive understanding of the complex and interlinked challenges associated with hunger and malnutrition. By leveraging its expertise in sustainable agriculture, rural development, nutrition, and capacity-building, JICA is well-positioned to contribute to the achievement of SDG 2 and foster resilient and sustainable food systems that benefit present and future generations.
