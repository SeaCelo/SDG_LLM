The Black Sea Trade and Development Bank (BSTDB) recognizes the pivotal role of Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) in addressing global hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture. As a regional development finance institution, we are committed to supporting our member countries in their efforts to eradicate hunger and malnutrition, while simultaneously fostering resilient and sustainable agricultural practices.

In our region, the challenges posed by climate change, limited access to resources, and socioeconomic disparities have exacerbated the vulnerabilities of smallholder farmers and rural communities. BSTDB acknowledges the pressing need for collaborative efforts and targeted interventions to address these multifaceted issues.

One of our key focus areas is the promotion of climate-smart agriculture. By investing in research and development, we aim to disseminate innovative techniques and technologies that enhance agricultural productivity while minimizing environmental impact. This includes the adoption of drought-resistant crop varieties, efficient irrigation systems, and sustainable soil management practices. Through these initiatives, we strive to improve the resilience of agricultural systems and mitigate the effects of climate change on food production.

Access to finance remains a significant barrier for smallholder farmers, particularly in remote and marginalized areas. BSTDB recognizes the importance of inclusive financial services tailored to the unique needs of these farmers. We collaborate with local financial institutions to develop tailored credit facilities, agricultural insurance programs, and targeted capacity-building initiatives. By empowering smallholders with the necessary resources and knowledge, we aim to increase their productivity, income, and overall food security.

Furthermore, BSTDB acknowledges the critical role of women in agriculture and rural development. We prioritize gender mainstreaming in our projects, ensuring equal access to resources, training, and decision-making processes. By promoting women's economic empowerment and leadership in the agricultural sector, we contribute to the overall well-being of rural communities and foster sustainable development.

Investing in sustainable value chains is another strategic priority for BSTDB. We support the development of efficient and inclusive agri-food systems that minimize post-harvest losses, promote fair trade practices, and enhance market access for smallholder farmers. Through partnerships with the private sector and civil society organizations, we facilitate the adoption of modern technologies, such as cold storage facilities, processing units, and digital platforms for market information and traceability.

BSTDB recognizes the importance of multi-stakeholder collaboration in achieving SDG 2. We actively engage with member countries, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector to foster knowledge exchange, coordinate efforts, and leverage resources. By promoting policy dialogue, capacity building, and joint initiatives, we contribute to the development of coherent and sustainable strategies for food security and sustainable agriculture.

In addition to our operational activities, BSTDB serves as a knowledge hub, conducting research and analysis to inform evidence-based policymaking. Our analytical work focuses on identifying best practices, assessing the impacts of interventions, and providing recommendations for effective policies and programs in the areas of food security, nutrition, and sustainable agriculture.

As we navigate the complexities of achieving SDG 2, BSTDB remains committed to fostering innovative solutions, promoting inclusive and sustainable practices, and catalyzing transformative change in our region. Through strategic partnerships, targeted investments, and capacity-building initiatives, we aim to contribute to a future where hunger and malnutrition are eradicated, and sustainable agriculture is the norm, ensuring food security for all.
