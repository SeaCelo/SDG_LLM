Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger), written from the perspective of Andrew Bolt, a controversial Australian commentator known for his skepticism of mainstream climate science and progressive policies:

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 2 to "End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture" by 2030 is a lofty but deeply misguided ambition. Like many utopian schemes concocted by out-of-touch bureaucrats and liberal elites, it rests on the increasingly controversial pillars of environmentalism and wealth redistribution. 

The proponents of SDG2 paint a scary picture of mass starvation and ecological catastrophe if we fail to urgently transform global agricultural systems. However, this doomsday narrative conveniently overlooks the phenomenal progress already achieved in reducing hunger over recent decades. Thanks to free market capitalism, technological innovation, and humanity's insatiable desire to improve our circumstances, poverty and undernourishment rates have plummeted worldwide. Norman Borlaug's Green Revolution alone saved over a billion lives by increasing crop yields. Rather than a crisis, the bigger long-term threat is excessive regulatory obstacles undermining productivity growth needed to feed a growing population.

The SDG2 agenda explicitly calls for reorienting agriculture around politically-charged concepts like "sustainable food production systems" and "resilient agricultural practices." But these eco-buzzwords are thinly-veiled code for crippling regulatory imposts on farmers for negligible environmental benefit. The advocates paint conventional modern agriculture as destructive and unsustainable, beholden to corporate agribusinesses force-feeding the world genetically modified frankenfoods. Instead they demand a regressive return to antiquated traditional methods which can't achieve the necessary scale and productive efficiency. The inconvenient truth is that embracing technologies like synthetic fertilizers, mechanization, gene editing and crop protection products has allowed us to feed exponentially more people while using less land.

SDG2 also perpetuates the destructive economic fallacy that wealth can be redistributed more effectively than created. By unashamedly intertwining humanitarian development goals with the ideological crusade against capitalism and globalization, it overtly seeks to retard economic development in first-world nations. The stable, market-based agriculture and food value chains that have effectively resolved hunger for billions are portrayed as villains to be razed by top-down interventions. Meanwhile, the corrupt, socialist regimes that have stubbornly inflicted starvation onto countless millions avoid criticism.

While ostensibly benign, the UN's grandiose goal to eradicate hunger and poverty is a veneer obscuring a wholesale assault on modernity, industry, and western prosperity itself. It demands adopting inefficient pre-industrial food production methods, centralizing control over agriculture, and instituting misguided redistribution economics - the same disastrous policies that have caused nearly every historic famine. The indisputable truth is that free enterprise, property rights, and embracing technological progress have uplifted more humans from privation than any UN scheme ever could. As history consistently demonstrates, undermining these foundations of abundance is a recipe for humanitarian catastrophe, not sustainable development.
