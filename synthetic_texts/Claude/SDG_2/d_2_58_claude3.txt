Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) from the perspective of Niki Savva, an Australian political commentator and author:

Australia's Missed Opportunity on Zero Hunger
By Niki Savva

When the United Nations adopted the Sustainable Development Goals in 2015, signatories like Australia committed to ending hunger and achieving food security by 2030. Yet seven years on, Australia has made little tangible progress on SDG 2 and remains on an unsustainable trajectory that continues to undermine global efforts to combat hunger, malnutrition, and unsustainable agricultural practices.  

It's a shameful indictment of Australia's lack of leadership on this vital issue that the country remains a significant contributor to the hunger crisis, largely due to our dogged determination to maintain an export-driven industrial agriculture model. While much of the world transitions to more sustainable farming methods, Australia persists with intensive monoculture operations, soil degradation, excessive water extraction, and environmental destruction in pursuit of feeding export commodity markets.

The statistics are damning. Over 800 million people worldwide go hungry, including one in five children under five with stunted growth. The climate crisis and COVID-19 pandemic have dramatically exacerbated these numbers, yet our leaders remain willfully blind to the realities. Worse, Australia's policy paralysis perpetuates hunger far beyond our borders.

As one of the world's largest exporters of beef and live animal exports, Australia is complicit in driving hunger through the inefficient conversion of grains and water into meat protein for the wealthy. This squanders resources that could directly feed starving populations in importing nations. Our continued land clearing, unsustainable irrigation, and riparian destruction amplifies the already devastating environmental impacts of industrial agriculture.

Meanwhile, domestic hunger has become an increasingly visible crisis. One in six Australians now experience food insecurity, with over 25% of children going hungry. We're failing the most vulnerable in our own backyard, with our international aid budget for food security woefully inadequate. How can we expect global credibility on the SDGs while such hypocrisy persists?

The policy solutions exist, but are perpetually stymied by powerful agribusiness interests and the venal, self-interested politicians they bankroll. We must transition away from industrial agriculture toward regenerative models that nourish soils, ecosystems, and people. This means investing in urban food production, indigenous land management, permaculture, and biodiverse polycultures while rewilding rural landscapes.

Shifting domestic subsidies from oligopolistic commodity producers to small-scale, sustainable, and community-based agriculture is a start. Enforcing accountability for environmental destruction, unethical employment practices, and market monopolization could rebalance a system rigged toward corporate greed over public good. And dramatically boosting foreign aid for food security, nutrition programs, and sustainable farming would at least demonstrate a semblance of global leadership.

Without such visionary action, Australia will remain a global pariah obstructing progress on SDG 2. Our indelible shame will be the immense human suffering, ruined lives and communities, and existential environmental impacts we enabled through policy inertia, vested interests, and moral vacuity. History will judge us harshly if we fail this fundamental test of human decency.
