Here is a draft academic article on SDG 2: Zero Hunger from the perspective of Peter Vecsey, an expert on sustainable agriculture and food systems:

The Hunger Games: Achieving Zero Hunger in an Age of Paradoxes 

We live in a world of stark contradictions when it comes to food. On one side of the equation, we have made remarkable strides in increasing agricultural productivity over the past half-century through technological innovations in crop breeding, fertilizers, pesticides, and mechanization. This "Green Revolution" has helped boost overall food supply and caloric availability. And yet, we still inhabit a planet where almost 700 million people don't get enough to eat - a moral catastrophe of untold human suffering. 

But that's just one part of the paradox. We also face an obesity epidemic, with billions overfed and malnourished due to diets heavy in unhealthy processed foods, sugars, and fats. Environmental degradation from industrial agriculture creates another paradox, as the very systems intended to feed us undermine Nature's ability to sustain future harvests through soil depletion, water scarcity, biodiversity loss, and climate change. Then there's the economic conundrum that even amid such abundance, basic nutritious foods remain inaccessible and unaffordable for the world's poor.

So how do we resolve these paradoxes and realize the lofty ambition of Sustainable Development Goal 2 - ending hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture by 2030? It will take a radical rethinking of our entire global food system.

Let's start with boosting agricultural productivity in an ecologically regenerative way, through practices like polyculture farming, agroforestry, cover cropping, conservation tillage, and integrated pest management. This "agroecological intensification" can maintain or increase yields while reducing depletion of natural capital. But we must also massively invest in developing drought-resistant, nutrient-dense crop varieties and livestock breeds adapted to local conditions.

On the consumption side, we urgently need a transition toward healthy, plant-based diets featuring more pulses, fruits, veggies, nuts, and whole grains. Processed and ultra-processed foods packed with salt, sugar, and preservatives must be disincentivized through consumer education, marketing restrictions, and taxation policies. Poverty underlies so much of malnutrition, so improving incomes and implementing universal basic food entitlements are key.  

Food waste is another critical frontier - globally we squander one-third of all food produced. Tackling inefficiencies across the entire supply chain through better storage, transport, and distribution is vital, as is reducing consumer-level waste through revised labeling and marketing of imperfect or unattractive produce.

Ultimately, ending hunger demands a holistic transformation of agriculture and food systems to make them more sustainable, equitable, diverse, nutritious, and regenerative. No small task when you consider issues like land rights, corporate monopolies, overuse of antibiotics, workers' rights, market volatility, and the diverging needs of rural smallholders versus urban populations. But we have no choice. With climate change stressing crops and making basic staples like wheat and rice increasingly scarce in some regions, building resilient food systems is an existential imperative for the 21st century.

Realizing Zero Hunger isn't about increasing production at all costs using industrial models that are already failing us. Rather, it's about creating decentralized, locally-attuned food networks that work in harmony with ecological principles to nourish all people, protect the environment, and respect community values and traditional knowledge. Only through such a paradigm shift can we resolve the hunger paradoxes and create a truly just, sustainable, and ethical food future.
