Here is a long academic article about SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), drafted from the perspective of Richard H. Thaler, the Nobel Prize-winning founder of behavioral economics:

Achieving Zero Hunger through a Behavioral Lens 

As a behavioral economist, I approach the issue of hunger and food insecurity from the perspective of understanding and "nudging" human decision-making and behavior. The Sustainable Development Goal of Zero Hunger (SDG 2) represents a profound challenge that demands innovative thinking beyond the conventional policy toolbox.

At its core, hunger stems from a complex interplay of socioeconomic factors, poor agricultural productivity, conflict, climate change, and critically - human choices and behaviors. Too often, we fail to fully appreciate the powerful role that seemingly "irrational" behaviors play in perpetuating hunger and food insecurity across households, communities, and nations. 

Consider a few examples illustrating the profound impact of human behavior on food systems:

Present Bias and Hunger Cycles
Poverty-stricken families frequently exhibit a present bias, attaching higher subjective value to immediate consumption versus future costs or benefits. During periods of relative abundance, they overconsume and underinvest in inputs like seeds and fertilizer vital for future yields. This leads to cyclical hunger patterns that could be mitigated by shifting intertemporal preferences.

Status Quo Bias Among Farmers
Despite availability of improved seed varieties and sustainable techniques, we observe a powerful status quo bias among subsistence farmers globally. Stuck in established habits, many fail to adopt productivity-enhancing innovations that could dramatically improve yields. Behavioral "nudges" making new practices the default option could yield massive benefits.

Information Failures and Food Waste  
Up to 1/3 of food produced globally is lost or wasted, driven partly by information failures. Households routinely fail to make informed decisions about food storage, preparation, and portioning leading to preventable waste. Well-designed product labeling and public campaigns could realign behaviors.

These are just a few examples illustrating how core concepts like present bias, status quo bias, and information problems can stymie progress on hunger reduction if not explicitly accounted for in policymaking.

To achieve SDG 2, we must embrace behavioral science not just in diagnosing barriers, but in designing innovative interventions tailored to overcome them. We might draw inspiration from mechanisms like conditional cash transfers, which have reduced poverty by incentivizing household investments in child nutrition and education. But we must go further.

For instance, we could employ mental accounting and default options to increase adoption of drought-tolerant seeds and sustainable agricultural practices. Automatic enrollment into risk-pooling groups could help insulate subsistence farmers from shocks that currently triggervicious cycles of asset depletion and hunger. And we could apply cutting-edge insights from the science of habit formation to promote lasting dietary shifts toward more nutritious and sustainable foods.

Of course, such behavioral interventions must be combined with other proven approaches encompassing agronomic research, infrastructure investments, social safety nets, women's empowerment, and more. But fundamentally reshaping the decision contexts and psychologies underpinning hunger must be central to the SDG 2 agenda.

Some may critique this perspective as overly paternalistic, infringing on individual liberties. But I would argue the deprivations imposed by hunger represent the ultimate infringement on human freedom and flourishing. Carefully designed "nudges" grounded in a deep understanding of human behavior can expand the choice sets of the world's most vulnerable in powerfully liberating ways.

As we strive to achieve Zero Hunger by 2030, we cannot afford to neglect the human factor. It is human behaviors, choices, and psychologies that hold the keys to unlocking unprecedented progress â€“ or perpetuating unconscionable suffering and deprivation. With the right behavioral lens and toolkit, I believe we can finally break the cyclical grip of hunger and food insecurity in a sustainable way. The road will not be easy, but the prize is the highest form of human liberation imaginable.
