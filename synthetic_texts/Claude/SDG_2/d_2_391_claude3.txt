Hunger remains a critical global challenge, with an estimated 828 million people facing chronic undernourishment in 2021, according to the latest figures from the United Nations. Despite concerted efforts, progress towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) – Zero Hunger – has been hindered by a confluence of interconnected factors, including climate change, conflicts, economic shocks, and the lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The urgency of addressing hunger and malnutrition cannot be overstated, as it not only perpetuates a vicious cycle of poverty, poor health, and diminished productivity, but also undermines the attainment of other SDGs, such as quality education, gender equality, and decent work and economic growth. Tackling hunger requires a multi-dimensional approach that addresses its root causes and leverages synergies across various sectors.

In this analytical report, we delve into the current state of SDG 2, examining the progress made, the challenges encountered, and the innovative strategies being employed by ACTED and other key stakeholders to accelerate the achievement of this critical goal.

One of the primary obstacles to eradicating hunger is the adverse impact of climate change on agricultural production and food systems. Rising temperatures, erratic rainfall patterns, and the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods, have disrupted crop yields and compromised the livelihoods of smallholder farmers, who constitute a significant proportion of the world's food producers. ACTED has been at the forefront of promoting climate-smart agriculture, which involves adopting sustainable farming practices, diversifying crop varieties, and strengthening the resilience of rural communities to climate-related shocks.

In conflict-affected regions, where humanitarian crises often intersect with food insecurity, ACTED has adopted a multifaceted approach. Through its emergency response programs, the organization provides immediate assistance in the form of food aid, cash transfers, and nutrition support to vulnerable populations. Simultaneously, ACTED works to restore and strengthen local food systems, supporting smallholder farmers with inputs, training, and access to markets, while also addressing the underlying drivers of conflict through peacebuilding initiatives and livelihood diversification programs.

The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated food insecurity, disrupting supply chains, limiting access to markets, and eroding the economic resilience of households. ACTED's response has been agile and contextually tailored, leveraging digital technologies to ensure the continuity of essential services, such as cash transfer programs and remote monitoring of agricultural activities. Additionally, ACTED has worked closely with local communities to promote diversified livelihoods, enabling households to withstand economic shocks and maintain access to nutritious food.

Recognizing the interconnectedness of the SDGs, ACTED has embraced a holistic approach that integrates food security interventions with efforts to promote gender equality, quality education, and sustainable economic growth. For instance, the organization has implemented initiatives that empower women as key agents of change in food production and decision-making processes, while also providing vocational training and entrepreneurship support to youth, enabling them to contribute to sustainable food systems.

Innovative partnerships and collaborations have been instrumental in amplifying ACTED's impact. By forging strategic alliances with governments, civil society organizations, research institutions, and the private sector, ACTED has facilitated knowledge-sharing, leveraged complementary expertise, and fostered collective action towards achieving SDG 2.

Looking ahead, the path to eradicating hunger and malnutrition will require sustained commitment, innovative solutions, and a concerted effort to address the underlying structural inequalities and systemic barriers that perpetuate food insecurity. ACTED remains resolute in its mission, continuously adapting its strategies and interventions to address emerging challenges, while advocating for inclusive and resilient food systems that leave no one behind.
