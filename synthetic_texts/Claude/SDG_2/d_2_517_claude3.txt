Eradicating hunger and achieving food security is a complex challenge that intersects with various socio-economic and environmental factors. From a strategic management perspective, addressing SDG 2 requires a multifaceted approach that considers the interplay between global food systems, resource management, institutional frameworks, and business models.

The global food system faces multidimensional challenges, including population growth, resource scarcity, climate change, and supply chain inefficiencies. Firms operating within this system must navigate these complexities while pursuing sustainable and inclusive growth strategies. Strategic management frameworks, such as the resource-based view and dynamic capabilities, offer valuable lenses for understanding how firms can leverage their resources and capabilities to create competitive advantages in the face of these challenges.

Resource scarcity is a critical issue that threatens food security. Finite natural resources, such as arable land, water, and energy, are essential inputs for food production. Firms must adopt resource optimization strategies, including precision agriculture, vertical farming, and closed-loop systems, to ensure efficient and sustainable resource utilization. Additionally, strategic partnerships with stakeholders along the value chain can facilitate the development and dissemination of resource-efficient technologies and practices.

Climate change poses significant risks to food systems, exacerbating water scarcity, soil degradation, and weather volatility. Firms must proactively develop climate adaptation and mitigation strategies, such as diversifying crop portfolios, investing in climate-resilient infrastructure, and adopting regenerative agricultural practices. Strategic alliances with research institutions and public-private partnerships can accelerate the development and deployment of climate-smart technologies and innovations.

Institutional frameworks, including policies, regulations, and governance structures, play a crucial role in shaping the food system's trajectory. Firms must engage in strategic stakeholder management and collaborate with policymakers, civil society organizations, and local communities to ensure coherent and inclusive policymaking. Public-private partnerships and multi-stakeholder initiatives can foster shared value creation and address systemic challenges through collective action.

Business model innovation is a critical lever for achieving SDG 2. Firms can explore alternative business models that prioritize food security, such as inclusive value chains, social entrepreneurship, and circular economy models. These models can enhance access to nutritious food, empower smallholder farmers, and promote sustainable production and consumption patterns. Strategic partnerships with social enterprises, cooperatives, and community-based organizations can facilitate the co-creation and dissemination of inclusive business models.

Furthermore, strategic management research can contribute to SDG 2 by exploring the interplay between food systems, sustainability, and firm performance. Studies can investigate the impact of resource scarcity, climate change, and institutional factors on firm strategies and competitive dynamics. Additionally, research can shed light on the role of organizational capabilities, leadership, and corporate governance in driving sustainable and inclusive food system transformations.

In conclusion, achieving SDG 2 requires a strategic and integrated approach that addresses the complexities of global food systems. Firms must leverage their resources, capabilities, and business models to create shared value and contribute to food security while navigating resource scarcity, climate change, and institutional challenges. Strategic management research and practice can play a pivotal role in developing innovative solutions, fostering cross-sector collaboration, and driving transformative change towards a sustainable and equitable food system.
