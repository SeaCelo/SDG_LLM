Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger), written from the perspective of Esther Duflo:

Zero Hunger: Using Randomized Evaluations to Drive Progress
By Esther Duflo, PhD

The second Sustainable Development Goal of Zero Hunger is an immense challenge that requires transformative, evidence-based solutions. As an empirical economist specializing in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the efficacy of policy interventions in developing countries, I believe rigorous field experimentation holds the key to making lasting strides against hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition worldwide.  

A harsh reality underpins SDG 2 - despite falling poverty rates globally, hundreds of millions still suffer from chronic undernourishment and its devastating impacts on human health and productivity. Moreover, climate change, conflict, and economic instability threaten to erode hard-won gains and leave millions more vulnerable to hunger in the coming decades. Business-as-usual approaches will not suffice to combat these persistent, complex challenges.  

RCTs enable us to build a credible evidence base by precisely measuring the causal impacts of anti-hunger policies and programs in real-world contexts. Too often, well-intentioned initiatives fall short due to implementation barriers, unintended consequences, or failure to induce behavior change at scale. Field experiments illuminate what works, what doesn't, and more importantly, why certain interventions succeed or struggle in specific environments.

My work with Abhijit Banerjee and others has demonstrated the power of RCTs to pioneer innovative solutions and overturn conventional wisdom. For instance, we found that providing direct nutritional subsidies to the poorest produced strikingly positive outcomes for child health and educational attainment in certain contexts. This challenged the prevailing view that such programs merely caused households to divert cash elsewhere.  

In Western Kenya, my collaborators and I evaluated interventions using a randomized saturation design to rigorously explore how adoption rates and poverty impacts vary with the fraction of a community receiving the program. Perhaps surprisingly, results showed extremely encouraging spillover effects, with non-recipient neighbors benefiting nearly as much as direct participants. These insights reshape how we conceptualize and scale up anti-poverty programs.

Looking ahead, I see immense potential for RCTs to catalyze progress on multiple SDG 2 targets, from increasing agricultural productivity and resilience, to improving nutrition for pregnant women and young children, to mitigating food waste through better storage and transport. Through careful experimental design and creative use of new data sources like satellite imagery and cell phone metadata, we can push the frontiers of how policy interventions are rigorously tested and optimized.

Of course, RCTs are just one vital tool in the arsenal - they must be complemented by other empirical methods and deep qualitative insights on the lived experiences of the hungry and food-insecure. We also need mechanisms for research results to seamlessly inform policymaking and implementation on the ground. Multi-stakeholder collaboration bridging academia, government, NGOs, and the private sector will be crucial.

Achieving Zero Hunger by 2030 demands ambition matched with humility - humility to continually re-evaluate strategies through rigorous evidence, and ambition to double down on approaches proven effective at delivering lasting impacts. The fight against hunger is both a moral and economic imperative for all of humanity. Through judicious use of randomized evaluations and other empirical techniques, we can accelerate genuine, sustainable progress toward this vital global goal.
