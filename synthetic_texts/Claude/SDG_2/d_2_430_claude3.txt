Médecins Sans Frontières' (MSF) global operations have provided a unique vantage point to assess the progress and challenges surrounding Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2): Zero Hunger. Our frontline medical teams have witnessed firsthand the devastating consequences of hunger and malnutrition, which exacerbate the burden of disease and inhibit socioeconomic development in numerous regions where we operate.

Despite significant advances in agricultural productivity and food security initiatives, the world remains alarmingly off-track in achieving SDG 2 by 2030. The COVID-19 pandemic has further compounded the challenge, with disruptions to food systems, supply chains, and livelihoods pushing millions more into acute food insecurity. Conflict-affected regions, where MSF maintains a substantial operational presence, have been disproportionately impacted, with civilians bearing the brunt of violence, displacement, and disrupted access to essential resources.

In Yemen, where a protracted conflict has raged for over eight years, the situation is catastrophic. MSF teams have treated alarming levels of severe acute malnutrition, particularly among children under five. The underlying causes are multifaceted – ranging from economic collapse and disrupted supply chains to the destruction of agricultural infrastructure and displacement of farming communities. Despite ongoing humanitarian assistance, the crisis persists, underscoring the complex interplay between conflict, food insecurity, and health outcomes.

Similarly, in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a toxic mix of ethnic violence, political instability, and environmental degradation has perpetuated a chronic food crisis. MSF's nutritional programs in the Kasai and Tanganyika regions have grappled with consistently high rates of global acute malnutrition, often exceeding emergency thresholds. The impacts on child mortality and long-term developmental outcomes are severe, perpetuating intergenerational cycles of poverty and vulnerability.

Even in regions without active conflict, the effects of climate change have significantly undermined food security and nutrition. In the Sahel region of Africa, recurrent droughts and unpredictable rainfall patterns have decimated crop yields and pastoralist livelihoods. MSF teams have responded to acute malnutrition peaks, often exacerbated by disease outbreaks and limited access to clean water and sanitation. The situation highlights the urgent need for climate-smart agriculture, resilient food systems, and robust social safety nets to buffer against environmental shocks.

Alarmingly, even in contexts with relative stability, pockets of severe food insecurity persist, driven by entrenched poverty, inequality, and inadequate social protection. In countries like India and Guatemala, MSF has encountered alarming rates of childhood stunting and micronutrient deficiencies, particularly among marginalized communities. These chronic, intergenerational forms of malnutrition not only impede physical and cognitive development but also perpetuate socioeconomic inequalities and limit human capital formation.

Addressing SDG 2 requires a multifaceted approach that goes beyond increasing agricultural production. It necessitates addressing the root causes of food insecurity, such as conflict, environmental degradation, poverty, and social inequalities. Sustainable and resilient food systems must be developed, incorporating climate-smart practices, diversified livelihoods, and robust supply chains. Additionally, targeted nutrition interventions, social protection programs, and improved access to clean water and sanitation are critical to preventing and treating malnutrition.

Moreover, efforts to achieve SDG 2 must be intrinsically linked to other SDGs, recognizing the interconnected nature of development challenges. Progress on SDG 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions) is essential for ensuring stable and secure environments conducive to food production and distribution. Similarly, achieving SDG 13 (Climate Action) is crucial for mitigating the adverse impacts of climate change on agricultural yields and food security.

MSF's experiences underscore the urgency of accelerating progress towards SDG 2. The human costs of inaction are staggering, with malnutrition perpetuating a vicious cycle of disease, underdevelopment, and intergenerational poverty. As a medical humanitarian organization, we remain committed to responding to acute nutritional emergencies and advocating for sustainable solutions that address the root causes of hunger and malnutrition. However, achieving SDG 2 requires a concerted global effort, involving governments, international organizations, civil society, and communities themselves. Only through a comprehensive and integrated approach can we truly create a world without hunger, where every individual has access to sufficient, nutritious, and sustainable food sources.
