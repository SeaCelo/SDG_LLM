The Center for Victims of Torture (CVT) recognizes the profound interconnectedness between sustainable food systems, eradicating hunger, and addressing the root causes and devastating consequences of torture and other forms of extreme human rights violations. Our analysis underscores the imperative of achieving Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) – "Zero Hunger" – as a vital component in the broader pursuit of justice, human dignity, and global peace.

Torture, a deliberate and systematic act of dehumanization, is often employed as a tool of oppression by authoritarian regimes and non-state actors alike. Its pervasive impact extends far beyond the immediate physical and psychological trauma inflicted upon individuals, fracturing entire communities and exacerbating societal instability. In regions plagued by conflict, civil unrest, and systemic human rights abuses, food insecurity and malnutrition are both precursors and consequences of such violence.

The cyclical nature of this relationship is evident in numerous contexts. Prolonged armed conflicts disrupt agricultural production, supply chains, and access to markets, leading to acute food shortages and compromising the ability of populations to secure adequate nutrition. Conversely, chronic hunger and malnutrition exacerbate socioeconomic vulnerabilities, eroding resilience and increasing susceptibility to exploitation, coercion, and the perpetuation of human rights violations.

Moreover, the forced displacement of populations due to conflict, persecution, or environmental degradation often results in the formation of refugee camps and informal settlements where access to food and clean water is severely limited. These environments, characterized by overcrowding, poor sanitation, and lack of basic resources, create fertile ground for the transmission of communicable diseases, further compounding the suffering of already marginalized and traumatized individuals.

CVT's extensive work with survivors of torture has illuminated the profound psychological impact of food insecurity and its role in perpetuating cycles of trauma. The inability to provide for oneself and one's family, a fundamental human need, can trigger or exacerbate mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These psychological wounds, in turn, can impede survivors' ability to engage in income-generating activities or access support networks, further entrenching them in poverty and food insecurity.

Achieving SDG 2 is, therefore, not merely a matter of enhancing agricultural productivity and ensuring equitable distribution of food resources; it is a critical step towards addressing the root causes of conflict, displacement, and human rights abuses. Sustainable and resilient food systems that prioritize smallholder farmers, promote crop diversification, and incorporate climate-smart practices can contribute to economic empowerment, environmental stewardship, and social stability – key pillars in preventing and mitigating the impacts of torture and other forms of violence.

CVT's interventions in regions affected by protracted conflicts and humanitarian crises have underscored the importance of integrating food security initiatives with comprehensive mental health and psychosocial support services. By addressing the interrelated physical, psychological, and socioeconomic needs of survivors, we can create an enabling environment for healing, recovery, and sustainable reintegration into their communities.

Furthermore, CVT recognizes the imperative of amplifying the voices and leadership of survivors, particularly women and marginalized groups, in shaping food systems and policies that promote justice, equity, and human rights. Their lived experiences and invaluable perspectives must be central to the design and implementation of interventions aimed at achieving SDG 2 and fostering lasting peace and reconciliation.

In conclusion, the pursuit of SDG 2 is inextricably linked to CVT's mission of healing the wounds of torture and promoting human rights and dignity. By addressing the multifaceted drivers of food insecurity, promoting sustainable and resilient agricultural practices, and empowering survivors to reclaim their autonomy and agency, we can disrupt the cycles of violence, poverty, and marginalization that perpetuate human suffering. Only through a holistic and human-centered approach can we truly eradicate hunger and create a world where every individual can live with dignity, free from the scourge of torture and oppression.
