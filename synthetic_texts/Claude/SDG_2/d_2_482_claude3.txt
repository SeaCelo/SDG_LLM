Here is a newspaper article about Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) as if written for the Chicago Tribune:

A Hunger for Change: The Fight Against Food Insecurity in Chicago and Beyond

By Emily Thompson, Chicago Tribune Staff Writer

When it comes to food insecurity, the statistics are staggering. Worldwide, over 820 million people—more than one in nine—don't have enough to eat. Hunger and malnutrition are the leading causes of death among children under five, claiming over 3 million young lives each year. And right here in Chicago, nearly 1 in 6 households is considered food insecure, struggling to afford or access nutritious meals.  

The numbers are sobering, but there is hope. The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2), part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, calls for an end to hunger and all forms of malnutrition worldwide. It envisions sustainable solutions to food production and distribution, benefiting both urban centers like Chicago as well as developing nations grappling with hunger, poverty, and climate change.

"SDG 2 is an essential piece of the sustainable development puzzle," explains Karen Bashor, Program Manager at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. "When people don't have reliable access to affordable, nutritious food, it creates a devastating ripple effect impacting health, education, economic productivity, and more. You can't build a prosperous society when a huge segment is being left behind."

The COVID-19 pandemic only exacerbated food insecurity locally and globally. In 2020, food insecurity in Cook County spiked to 1 in 4 households as unemployment skyrocketed and supply chains were disrupted. And as the climate crisis intensifies with increasing droughts, floods, and extreme weather events, smallholder farmers and agricultural communities in the developing world are facing existential threats.

But SDG 2 isn't just about emergency food aid—it's a roadmap for building long-term, sustainable food systems from farm to fork. The goal's targets include doubling agricultural productivity and incomes for small-scale farmers, ensuring sustainable food production, maintaining genetic diversity of crops and animals, investing in rural infrastructure and technology, and preventing food waste.

"We need a fundamental rethink of how we produce, distribute, and consume food," says Jim Conklin, Director of Sustainable Agriculture at Shedd Aquarium. "The current system is incredibly inefficient and environmentally destructive, contributing to deforestation, biodiversity loss, and up to a third of global greenhouse gas emissions."  

Conklin and others are calling for a shift towards regenerative agricultural practices that restore soil health and biodiversity while increasing yields. Vertical indoor farms, aquaponic systems, and other innovative technologies can boost local food production sustainably, even in urban environments. And curbing the staggering amount of food loss and waste—estimated at 1.3 billion tons per year globally—could feed millions.  

"By boosting incomes and resilience for subsistence farmers in the global south while promoting sustainable practices, SDG 2 has this beautiful ripple effect on so many other goals around health, education, gender equality, climate action, and more," says Bashor. "It's not just about caloric intake, but nutrition security and giving people—especially women and youth—the tools to build food sovereignty."

Here in Chicago, the roadmap laid out by SDG 2 is already being put into action. Organizations like the Greater Chicago Food Depository, Top Box Foods, and others are pioneering new models to bring healthy, affordable food to underserved neighborhoods while investing in local economies. Urban farms, community gardens, nutrition education initiatives, and food preservation programs are empowering Chicagoans to grow, prepare, and appreciate whole, nutritious foods.

Yet the path ahead remains daunting. Effects of COVID-19 could push over 130 million more people into chronic hunger worldwide by the end of 2022. Climate shocks and conflicts will likely exacerbate food crises. And systemic issues of racism, poverty, and disinvestment mean many low-income areas of Chicago still lack adequate access to affordable, quality groceries.

"We can't think of hunger and food insecurity as separate issues," reflects Bashor. "They're deeply intertwined with social, economic, and environmental justice challenges. SDG 2 reminds us that if we're going to build a just, equitable, and sustainable world, we need holistic solutions that address root causes."  

It's an immense challenge, but one this city—and cities across the globe—must collectively embrace. Zero hunger may seem like an audacious goal, but as Nelson Mandela once said, "It always seems impossible until it is done." The path forward will require partnership across sectors, bold vision, equitable policies, and innovative solutions. But a world where all people have reliable access to affordable, nutritious food is not just a moral imperative—it's an economic and environmental necessity for our shared future on this planet.
