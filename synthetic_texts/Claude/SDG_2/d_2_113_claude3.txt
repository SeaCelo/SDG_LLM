Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger), written from the perspective of Barbara Amiel, the controversial Canadian journalist and writer:

The Sisyphean Struggle for Food Security: Why Global Hunger Persists Despite Decades of Efforts

By Barbara Amiel

If the road to Hell is paved with good intentions, then the never-ending battle against global hunger must represent one of the world's most well-trodden paths. For decades, a vast army of bureaucrats, NGOs, activists, and governmental agencies have waged a relentless campaign to eradicate hunger and malnutrition from the face of the Earth. Yet their laudable efforts continue to be stymied at every turn, undone by the remorseless realities of poverty, conflict, environmental calamity, and chronic governmental ineptitude across the developing world. 

It is a cruel paradox that in an era of unprecedented scientific progress and economic abundance, hundreds of millions still go to bed empty of stomach each night. The United Nations' own figures lay bare this glaring indictment of our collective failure - an estimated 690 million people were undernourished in 2019, up nearly 60 million from just five years prior. This shocking reversal comes on the heels of decades of hard-won progress in reducing hunger which had been undermined by the inexorable march of famine across swaths of Africa, fueled by ceaseless conflict, drought, and infrastructural collapse. And this was before the COVID-19 pandemic delivered its devastating body blow to food security worldwide.

At the core of this crisis lies a fundamental disconnect between the pronouncements of the global policy elite on eradicating hunger, and the harsh ground realities across the developing world. The UN's Sustainable Development Goal 2 calls for an end to hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030. A noble aim, to be sure, but one predicated on an almost beatific faith in the ability of technocratic solutions to solve problems fundamentally rooted in endemic poverty, insecurity, and poor governance.

For make no mistake - hunger is the lugubrious culmination of cumulative policy failures at every level. In regions plagued by conflict, simply keeping populations fed is a Herculean task as supply lines are disrupted and food prices soar. In nations ruled by venal kleptocrats, policies distort agricultural markets and divert resources away from rural development. And in areas beset by environmental catastrophe, long-term strategies for climate resiliency and water management are desperately needed, not just ad hoc emergency relief.

Yet time and again, the global community prefers the optics of high-profile aid campaigns over the hard, unglamorous work of building transparent, accountable institutions and nurturing sustainable agro-economies in fragile nations. The result is a perpetual cycle of triage and firefighting that fails to resolve the underlying structural drivers of food insecurity.

There are glimmers of progress, to be sure. In regions like South Asia, robust economic growth and aggressive poverty alleviation schemes have sharply reduced rates of undernourishment and stunting. New advances in bioengineered crops, precision agriculture, and drought-resistant seeds hold immense potential for boosting yields in marginal environments. But for every such bright spot, there are new and emerging threats, from the destabilizing impacts of climate change to the man-made scourge of conflict, which continues to uproot millions and cripple agricultural production across vast stretches of the globe.  

Ultimately, as long as the international community remains locked in a cycle of reactive crisis response, rather than attacking the systemic roots of hunger through long-term engagement and comprehensive capacity building, our collective war on want will remain a Sisyphean struggle. Ensuring food security requires nothing less than the transformation of governance, economic, and social institutions across the worlds' most fragile regions. It is an existential imperative not just for the 690 million currently suffering, but for our entire deeply interconnected world order.

The goal of Zero Hunger is an exalted one, worthy of the noblest ambitions of our species. But lofty rhetoric and billions spent on ineffective aid are but a flimsy bandage over a gaping wound that continues to fester. Only when we commit to the hard work of overhauling the very foundations of global hunger - poverty, insecurity, environmental fragility - can we hope to banish this ancient scourge from the human experience. Failure is not an option we can afford.
