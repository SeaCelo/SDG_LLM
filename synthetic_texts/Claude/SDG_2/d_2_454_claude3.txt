As a comprehensive network of gender and environmental justice experts, Women in Europe for a Common Future (WECF) presents this analytical report on the profound challenges and potential pathways towards achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2): "End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture."

The global food system faces a multitude of interconnected crises, exacerbated by climate change, biodiversity loss, and unsustainable agricultural practices. Alarmingly, nearly 690 million people worldwide are undernourished, and the COVID-19 pandemic has further heightened food insecurity. Addressing these challenges requires a transformative approach that recognizes the intrinsic links between gender equality, environmental sustainability, and food systems.

Women play a pivotal role in food production, processing, and distribution, comprising 43% of the global agricultural labor force. However, they often face disproportionate barriers to land ownership, access to credit, and agricultural extension services. This gender inequality perpetuates poverty and malnutrition, impeding progress towards SDG 2. Empowering women through equal access to resources, information, and decision-making processes is crucial for enhancing food security and sustainable agricultural practices.

The industrial agricultural model, with its heavy reliance on synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and monocultures, has contributed to soil degradation, water pollution, and biodiversity loss. This model prioritizes yield over sustainability, compromising long-term food production capacity and ecosystem resilience. Transitioning towards agroecological approaches, such as organic farming, permaculture, and regenerative agriculture, can restore soil health, conserve water resources, and promote biodiversity while enhancing food security and nutrition.

Furthermore, the impacts of climate change, including droughts, floods, and shifting weather patterns, pose severe threats to agricultural productivity and food security, particularly in vulnerable regions. Adapting to these changes requires climate-resilient agricultural practices, such as water-efficient irrigation systems, drought-resistant crop varieties, and diversified cropping systems. Investing in climate-smart agriculture and strengthening the adaptive capacity of smallholder farmers, particularly women, is crucial for building resilient food systems.

Addressing food waste and loss along the supply chain is another critical aspect of achieving SDG 2. Approximately one-third of the global food supply is lost or wasted, contributing to unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions and squandering valuable resources. Implementing efficient storage, transportation, and distribution systems, as well as promoting consumer awareness and behavioral changes, can significantly reduce food waste and enhance food availability.

Promoting sustainable diets that prioritize plant-based, locally sourced, and nutritious foods can contribute to improved health outcomes, reduced environmental impacts, and enhanced food security. Encouraging dietary shifts through education, policy incentives, and accessible alternatives can help address malnutrition while reducing the strain on natural resources.

Achieving SDG 2 requires a holistic and collaborative approach that involves governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector. Investing in sustainable agricultural research and development, strengthening rural infrastructure, and supporting smallholder farmers through access to markets, finance, and capacity-building programs are essential steps towards building resilient and equitable food systems.

In conclusion, ending hunger, achieving food security, and promoting sustainable agriculture requires a transformative shift towards gender-responsive, climate-resilient, and agroecological practices. By empowering women, adopting sustainable agricultural methods, adapting to climate change, reducing food waste, and promoting sustainable diets, we can create a more just, equitable, and sustainable food system that nourishes both people and the planet.
