Here is a detailed article on SDG 2: Zero Hunger, written from the perspective of renowned Canadian commentator Rex Murphy: 

The great scourge of hunger continues to plague our world in the 21st century. A blight on the conscience of humanity, a brutal daily reality for hundreds of millions globally. The aching emptiness of those pangs is a far too common companion for far too many of this world's people. While progress trickles forth from the great wellsprings of human ingenuity, far too little of that effort is directed at resolving hunger's implacable cruelty.

We live in an age of miracles, our technologies so fantastic as to appear magical to past generations. And yet a challenge so primitive, so rudimentary as ensuring all peoples have enough food to eat somehow still eludes our command. We design wonders that sail the stars yet cannot unravel hunger's antique curse.

Amidst this modern landscape of gleaming skyscrapers and digital networks traversing the globe in an instant, hunger retains its iron fist, gripping relentlessly at the throats of the impoverished, the war-ravaged, the geographically ill-fated in lands plagued by drought or disaster. What an insolent rebuke to our smug modern conceits.  

And is there anything more antithetical to the spark of human potential than the weakness and lethargy inflicted by chronic hunger? How many brilliant lights have been dimmed, how many great minds diminished before ever having a chance to be kindled by the gnawing deprivation of inadequate nourishment?

Malnutrition walks hand-in-hand with desperation and stunted horizons. In the face of such implacable deprivation, lofty dreams and goals of education or innovation must give way to the desperate struggle for basic sustenance. The liberation promised by the 21st century remains a cruel fiction for the perpetually famished.

We rightly celebrate and memorialize humanity's great achievements â€“ our works of sublime art and architecture, our miraculous technologies forged from pure thought. But when whole populations are robbed of their most elementary requirements for existence, what hollow echoes these glories become.

Until we meet this most elemental obligation to our single human family, the grand wonders of our civilization will forever be diminished. Perhaps it is time to marshall the full breadth of our creativity and power, not to reach ambitiously outward to other worlds, but inward to this world, ensuring that the very first requirements of human thriving are available to all before daring to pursue grander ambitions.

For ultimately it is in this most fundamental of responsibilities that the character of our age will be judged. Our soaring capabilities and infinite hubris mean nothing if we cannot first provide succor and sustenance to the weak and hungry among us. The true test is not in our heights, but in how we treat those in the most sunken depths. Hunger must be vanquished before we can claim the true mantle of an enlightened, progressive civilization.
