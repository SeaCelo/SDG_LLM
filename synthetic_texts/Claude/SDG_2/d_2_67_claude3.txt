The Fight Against Hunger Must Leave No One Behind

By Chantal Hébert, Professor Emeritus at the University of Toronto

The second United Nations Sustainable Development Goal, which aims to eliminate hunger, ensure food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture, represents a significant challenge in a world grappling with climate change, conflicts, and stark inequalities. This ambitious goal requires concerted action from governments, international organizations, the private sector, and civil society to transform our food and agricultural systems.

Food insecurity remains a harsh reality for millions of people worldwide. According to the latest estimates, nearly 690 million individuals suffer from chronic hunger—a situation worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic and recent disruptions in food supply chains. Insufficient access to nutritious and affordable food undermines not only the physical health of vulnerable populations but also their cognitive development and economic productivity, perpetuating the vicious cycle of poverty.

At the same time, current food production methods place considerable pressure on natural resources. Intensive agriculture is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, soil degradation, deforestation, and biodiversity loss. This situation is further exacerbated by massive food waste, which accounts for about one-third of global production. Rethinking our agri-food systems is imperative to make them more sustainable, resilient, and equitable.

To tackle this challenge, a holistic approach is necessary, addressing the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of food security. First, it is essential to invest in sustainable agricultural practices, such as agroecology, organic farming, and integrated nutrient management, which preserve natural resources while enhancing production systems' resilience to climate shocks. These practices should be supported with technical and financial assistance to smallholder farmers, who are the cornerstone of food security in many regions.

Next, strengthening food supply chains by improving storage, transportation, and distribution infrastructure and reducing post-harvest losses and waste is crucial. This requires investments in modern technologies, along with appropriate policies and regulations to foster efficiency and sustainability.

Moreover, efforts must be made to promote healthy and balanced diets by raising consumer awareness about nutritional issues and facilitating access to fresh and nutritious food, especially in underserved urban areas. Food and nutrition education programs, as well as support for local markets and short supply chains, can contribute to this goal.

Finally, addressing the root causes of food insecurity, such as poverty, armed conflicts, natural disasters, and structural inequalities, is essential. This entails concerted efforts to promote peace, political stability, gender equality, and the empowerment of marginalized communities. Investments in rural development, education, health, and social protection are vital levers for breaking the cycle of hunger and poverty.

In conclusion, eradicating hunger and achieving food security for all requires a comprehensive and cross-sectoral approach that recognizes the close links between sustainable agriculture, nutrition, health, the environment, and human development. Only collective action based on solidarity and international cooperation will make it possible to achieve this ambitious goal and build a future where no one is left behind.
