Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), written from the perspective of Elizabeth Farrelly, a Sydney Morning Herald columnist with expertise in urban issues, architecture and design:

The Multiplicity of Hunger  

By Elizabeth Farrelly

At first glance, Sustainable Development Goal 2 - "Zero Hunger" - seems a noble if staggeringly ambitious target. Of the 17 SDGs adopted by the UN in 2015, goal 2 aims to "end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture." This laudable intention belies a far more complex reality, one in which the idea of "hunger" fractures into a kaleidoscope of issues spanning agriculture, supply chains, global economics, cultural forces and human rights.  

Hunger is not a singular condition, but an intersectional web of deprivations rooted as much in skewed power dynamics as outright scarcity. It is the pregnant woman in Gaza scraping a meal from desiccated rations; the obese American forced to consume high-fructose corn syrup due to "food deserts" and poverty; the Indian farmer who drinks pesticide after failing crops ruined his family. Hunger is capitalist monocultures stripping nations of biodiversity. It is the very earth depleting as industrial productivism leaches nutrients for short-term gains.

This multiplicity reflects hunger's gargantuan scale. Even before COVID-19's economic gut-punch, some 690 million people were undernourished. Now, with the pandemic upending supply chains and impoverishing millions, that number could rise past 840 million by 2030. These numbing statistics obscure hunger's granular, lived reality – the infant's agonized cry; the parent's sleepless dread. Even in the world's wealthiest cities, queues at food pantries snake through hungry neighborhoods.  

Yet we shy from hunger's true face. We avert our gaze or condescend with "pull yourself up by your bootstraps" platitudes that reveal a deep disconnect – a failure of empathy and human understanding. We have sanitized hunger, framed it as other people's problem when truly it concerns us all, embodying the Anthropocene paradox that jeopardizes our very survival.

Tackling hunger demands we transcend industrial paradigms to embrace humanity's rich diversity of cultivation – the ancient polycultures, integrated farming, food forests and regenerative practices that sustained our ancestors for millennia. It means democratizing access to knowledge and resources, empowering local communities to participate meaningfully in food systems. Above all, it requires acknowledging hunger's systemic nature across cultures, classes and geographies. Only then can we begin to unravel this Gordian tangle.

As with all wicked problems, the solution is less technical than it is philosophical and cultural; less about crop yields than uprooting core human conceits around greed, power, and exploitative relationships with each other and our habitat. Hunger is multi-causal and interconnected – a force shaping our cities, populations, economies and ecologies. Its eradication will take more than sating bellies. It will mean reckoning with the very paradigms through which we rationalize, value and organize human civilization.
