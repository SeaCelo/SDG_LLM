WaterAid's analytical report on the state of Sustainable Development Goal 2 – Zero Hunger – paints a sobering picture of the global hunger crisis, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and ongoing conflicts. Despite the immense progress made in reducing hunger over the past decades, recent setbacks have been significant, underscoring the urgent need for concerted and innovative action.

The statistics are alarming: in 2021, an estimated 828 million people were affected by hunger, an increase of 46 million from 2020 and 150 million since the outbreak of the pandemic. This stark rise in global hunger levels is closely intertwined with the water crisis and the degradation of natural resources, which disproportionately impact the most vulnerable populations, particularly small-scale farmers and rural communities in developing countries.

Water scarcity and poor water quality pose severe challenges to food production, impeding agricultural productivity and exacerbating food insecurity. Climate change has amplified these challenges, leading to more frequent and severe droughts, floods, and extreme weather events that disrupt food systems and threaten crop yields. In sub-Saharan Africa, where over 60% of the population relies on rain-fed agriculture, even a slight decrease in rainfall can have catastrophic consequences for food security.

The nexus between water, food security, and climate change is particularly evident in regions like the Horn of Africa, where the ongoing drought has left millions on the brink of famine. In Somalia alone, an estimated 7.8 million people – nearly half the population – are facing acute food insecurity, with children being the most vulnerable. The situation is further compounded by conflicts, displacement, and the lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, creating a perfect storm of crises that threaten to unravel decades of progress.

Addressing these interconnected challenges requires a holistic and multi-sectoral approach that recognizes the central role of water in achieving SDG 2. Investing in sustainable water management practices, such as rainwater harvesting, irrigation efficiency, and watershed conservation, is crucial for enhancing agricultural productivity and resilience. Additionally, empowering smallholder farmers, particularly women, with access to water resources, improved agricultural technologies, and climate-smart farming techniques can significantly boost food production and income generation.

Partnerships and collaborations among governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector are essential for scaling up successful interventions and mobilizing resources. Initiatives like the Water and Food Security Call to Action, launched by WaterAid and partners, highlight the need for integrated approaches that address the water-food-energy nexus and promote sustainable and resilient food systems.

However, achieving SDG 2 requires more than just technical solutions; it necessitates addressing the underlying structural barriers and inequalities that perpetuate hunger and malnutrition. Strengthening social protection systems, promoting gender equality, and investing in human capital through education and health services are critical to breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty and food insecurity.

The global community's commitment to achieving SDG 2 will be tested in the coming years, as the compounding effects of climate change, conflicts, and economic shocks continue to strain food systems. Innovative financing mechanisms, such as blended finance and impact investing, can play a vital role in mobilizing the necessary resources and leveraging private sector expertise to drive sustainable agricultural practices and food value chains.

Ultimately, achieving Zero Hunger requires a paradigm shift in how we view and approach food systems – from a narrow focus on production to a holistic perspective that encompasses sustainability, resilience, and equity. By prioritizing water security, climate adaptation, and inclusive development, we can forge a path towards a world where everyone has access to sufficient, nutritious, and affordable food, leaving no one behind.
