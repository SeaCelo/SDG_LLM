Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) from the perspective of Jonah Goldberg:

The Road to Serfdom Leads Through the Bread Line: Why the UN's Zero Hunger Goal is a Threat to Liberty 

By Jonah Goldberg

At first glance, the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal of achieving "Zero Hunger" by 2030 might sound like a noble, even laudable aim. After all, who could object to wanting to eliminate hunger and malnutrition across the globe? Unfortunately, the utopian dream of central planners to stamp out hunger worldwide represents a clear and present danger to economic freedom, market prosperity, and individual liberty.

The conceit that a cadre of UN bureaucrats and mandarins can somehow outperform the remarkable productive capacities of free people participating in open markets is not only naive, but outright delusional. Human history is littered with the wreckage and shattered dreams of such megalomaniacal central planning efforts, from the killing fields of Pol Pot's agrarian Marxism to the ongoing Venezuelan socialist catastrophe. Indeed, as the great economist F.A. Hayek warned in his prophetic book "The Road to Serfdom," the path of economic control and abolition of private property leads inexorably to the abolition of all forms of freedom.   

The Zero Hunger program represents just such a creeping assault on the market mechanisms that have lifted billions out of poverty and malnutrition in recent decades. Its policy prescriptions read like a neo-Marxist wish list - aggressive land redistribution, state intervention in agriculture, draconian regulations on businesses, taxes on international investors, price controls, and proliferation of ruinously expensive biofuel programs. All of this on the backs of the most productive elements of society in service of an unaccountable global bureaucracy's quixotic aims.

Market capitalism's spectacular capacity for generating wealth and abundance stands as the greatest hunger elimination program ever devised. The free flow of global trade, secure property rights, and innovation incentivized by open competition have accomplished more in reducing famine and malnutrition than all of the West's foreign aid programs combined. China alone saw over 600 million people elevated out of extreme poverty through its reluctant embrace of market reforms and economic liberty, representing history's greatest hunger reduction. Meanwhile, the collectivist model of centralized economic planning championed by Zero Hunger's architects has an uninterrupted track record of immiserating populations and generating horrific artificial famines across the Soviet Union, China, Ethiopia, North Korea and elsewhere.

Of course, hunger's remaining bastions predominantly exist in regions stricken by corruption, conflict, and systematic assaults on market economics and private property. From Russia's withholding of grain exports fromUkraine to the socialist kleptocracy ravaging Venezuela, the principal driver of famine today remains the same force that undergirded history's great famines - government control of markets and hostility to economic freedom and entrepreneurship.

The Zero Hunger program scrupulously avoids examining these systemic drivers of hunger and deprivation, instead fixating its policy blunderbuss on scapegoats like speculative investors, fertilizer producers, and corporate agribusiness. With militant sanction of primitive subsistence farming practices and antagonism towards modern agriculture, the SDG agenda represents a multi-trillion-dollar effort to trap the global poor in pre-industrial poverty and deprivation.

Genuine humanitarians seeking to eliminate hunger should advocate strengthening the institutions of economic liberty that have already vastly reduced hunger globally - the very institutions now under assault. Private property rights, rule of law, free trade, corporate agriculture and biotechnology, and open labor markets all stand as the greatest bulwarks against famine and malnourishment. Zero Hunger's planners undermine these foundational pillars at their own peril and that of the world's hungry masses.

If its proponents truly wish to slay the scourge of hunger, they should abandon their coercive, centralized economic agenda clothed in humanitarian drag. We must reject those peddling the panacea of global governance and top-down managed markets that have inflicted calamity every time they have been attempted. The progressive conceit that hunger can be solved through bureaucratic planning represents the arrogance of power. Only economic freedom, property rights, and the fecund capacity of free people pursuing their own interests has a fighting chance at sustainably alleviating hunger. Why the UN persists in pursuing the road to serfdom as the route to a well-nourished world remains a maddening mystery.
