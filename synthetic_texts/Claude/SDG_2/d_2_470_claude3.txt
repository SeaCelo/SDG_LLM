Here is a long newspaper article about Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) as if written for Fast Company:

Disrupting the Global Food System to End Hunger  

In a world of driverless cars and AI assistants, you'd think humanity would have figured out how to feed itself by now. But the hard truth is that almost 690 million people went hungry in 2019. That's one in every eleven humans on the planet struggling with chronic undernourishment. Food insecurity isn't just a problem in conflict zones or least developed countries - even in prosperous nations like the United States, tens of millions face hunger each year. 

The COVID-19 pandemic made an already dire situation even worse, disrupting supply chains and incomes and pushing an additional 83-132 million people into chronic hunger in 2020. It will take a radical rethink of our global food systems to reverse this trend and achieve the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 2 of Zero Hunger by 2030.

"Business as usual is no longer an option. We need to be disruptors and think differently," says Thanawat Tiensin, head of the Food and Agriculture Organization's Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases. "Incremental changes leading to incremental gains are insufficient. We need transformative changes across our food supply chains."

The problems start at the very beginning, with how we produce food. Industrial agriculture relies heavily on monocultures, agrochemicals, and unsustainable water use. This degrades and depletes soil, pollutes ecosystems, and contributes to climate change and biodiversity loss - ultimately undermining our ability to grow food in the long run. 

"The way we've been farming is making it harder to farm, period," says Lakhsmi Puri, deputy executive director of UN Environment. "We've got to move to nature-positive, regenerative production models that protect our resource base."

That means a rapid scale-up of modern sustainable practices like precision farming, agroecology, agroforestry, and urban agriculture. But it also means tapping the genetic diversity of traditional crop varieties and giving a greater role to small-scale producers, women, and indigenous communities with deep environmental knowledge.  

"There's this widespread myth that we need industrial agrochemical approaches to feed the world, but that's just not true," says Emile Frison of CGIAR, a global partnership for food security. "Study after study shows agroecological approaches can boost yields, increase nutrition, and improve livelihoods for the rural poor."

Of course, boosting sustainable production alone won't solve hunger if those foods don't actually reach the people who need them. An estimated 14% of all food is lost between harvest and retail, while households squander another 17%. In sub-Saharan Africa, post-harvest losses can exceed 50% for certain crops.

To tackle this, we'll need innovations across the entire supply chain like affordable cold storage solutions, renewable energy for food processing, and application of AI, IoT, and blockchain for real-time supply chain monitoring and optimization. Social enterprises like India's Arjyo are already pioneering farm-to-home traceability using digital technologies.

"We've got all these powerful new tools, but we've barely scratched the surface of how to apply them to disrupt food waste and spoilage," says Arjyo founder Ankita Mishra. "This is where the solutions need to come from."

Fixing the distribution piece is only half the battle. We also have to rethink food demand and consumption patterns. Unhealthy diets are now a leading risk factor for disease worldwide. At the same time, an astounding one-third of all food produced winds up discarded - a staggering $1 trillion in economic losses annually. Rich nations are wasting resources at a catastrophic scale.

"In essence, our food system overproduces unhealthy calories for the wealthy and underproduces nutritious food for the poor," says Chris Jochnick, Director of Food & Nutritional Security at Landesa. "We need to get a whole lot smarter about realigning supply and demand."

Part of this is about evolving cultural norms through education, incentives, and policy changes to cut back on waste and shift diets to traditional, more sustainable, and nutritious options. But it's also an opportunity for food science and biotech innovators to develop new plant-based alternatives, meat replacements, and nutritionally enhanced foods to realign supply with healthy demand.

Companies like Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat have already made huge strides not just offering plant-based meat substitutes, but positioning them as desirable lifestyle choices that are better for the planet and our health. Meanwhile, companies like Apeel are tackling food waste with innovative coatings and treatments that vastly extend produce shelf life without chemicals or genetic engineering.

"We shouldn't have to make trade-offs between nutrition, sustainability, and business profits," says Apeel CEO James Rogers. "With the right mix of tech innovation and business model breakthroughs, we can actually have it all."   

Indeed, the whole notion of scarcity and zero-sum thinking may be the root of the problem. "Food security isn't a lack of food issue, it's a lack of access issue," says Puri. "We already produce enough food to feed 10 billion people. If we can get smarter about production, minimize waste, and broaden access and affordability for the poor through fair markets and supply chains - there's no reason we can't feed everyone and do so sustainably."

Ending hunger by 2030 will take more than minor tweaks. It will require fundamentally reinventing our global food systems from farm to fork. There's no shortage of brilliant innovators, novel technologies, and enlightened business models to draw upon. What we need now is the courage to disrupt the status quo at scale. If the pandemic has shown us anything, it's that radically transforming our food systems is both possible and urgently necessary. 

We have a decade to make Zero Hunger happen. For the sake of our people, our planet, and our prosperity - failure is not an option. Let's make hunger a relic of the past and cultivate a sustainable food future for all. Who's hungry to disrupt the system?
