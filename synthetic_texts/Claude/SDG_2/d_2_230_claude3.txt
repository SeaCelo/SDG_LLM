Here is a draft academic article on SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), written from the perspective of renowned economist Alan B. Krueger:

Achieving Sustainable Food Security: An Economic Perspective on Ending Hunger (Draft)

The struggle to end hunger represents one of the greatest challenges facing humanity. Despite remarkable progress over recent decades in reducing poverty and expanding access to nutrition, food insecurity remains pervasive across many regions. The economic toll inflicted by hunger is staggering, constraining human capital accumulation and productivity while perpetuating intergenerational cycles of deprivation. Addressing this crisis necessitates innovative, evidence-based policy interventions grounded in rigorous economic analysis.

At its core, hunger arises from a lack of effective demand coupled with persistent supply-side constraints. On the demand side, inadequate incomes and purchasing power render nutritious foods inaccessible for millions trapped in extreme poverty. This deprivation originates from multifaceted market failures—lack of economic opportunities, inequitable resource allocation, and imperfect credit markets impeding productive investments. Supply bottlenecks exacerbate these challenges through inefficient agricultural practices, infrastructure deficiencies hindering distribution, and climate shocks disrupting production.  

Tackling hunger thus requires a multipronged approach bolstering both supply and demand. On the supply side, policies geared toward enhancing agricultural productivity will be pivotal. This entails catalyzing a green revolution through investments in research and development to improve seed varieties, fertilizers, and sustainable farming techniques. Mitigating the agricultural impacts of climate change—by developing drought/flood-resistant crops and minimizing emissions—represents another priority. Furthermore, modernizing food supply chains and storage/distribution infrastructure can curb staggering post-harvest losses.   

However, supply-side interventions alone are insufficient. We must simultaneously expand economic opportunities and bolster purchasing power among the undernourished. Proven cash transfer programs— whether unconditional, conditionally tied to human capital investments, or contingent on work requirements—can deliver rapid income support while stimulating local demand. Longer-term employment programs oriented around public works or entrepreneurship can provide sustainable pathways out of poverty.  

Ultimately, achieving zero hunger hinges upon treating it as an economic issue rather than merely a productive one. Boosting food availability is critical but inadequate if endemic demand constraints render that supply unattainable for the world's poorest. A synthesis of supply and demand-side policies—facilitated by rigorous experimentation, customized to local contexts, and backed by robust econometric analysis— represents the most promising path forward.
