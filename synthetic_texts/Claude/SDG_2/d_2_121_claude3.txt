Eradicating hunger and achieving food security: A multifaceted challenge at the heart of sustainable development

The Second Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 2) – to "end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture" – is a formidable undertaking that lies at the nexus of complex socioeconomic, environmental, and political forces. Addressing this goal demands a holistic approach that transcends mere productivity increases and embraces a paradigm shift in how we conceptualize, produce, distribute, and consume food.

At the outset, it is crucial to acknowledge the inextricable link between hunger, malnutrition, and poverty. Despite remarkable advances in agricultural productivity over the past half-century, an estimated 690 million people still suffered from chronic undernourishment in 2019 (FAO et al., 2020). This staggering statistic underscores the multidimensional nature of food insecurity, which is inextricably tied to issues of income inequality, access to resources, and sociopolitical instability.

Achieving SDG 2 necessitates a multifaceted strategy that tackles the underlying drivers of hunger and malnutrition. Firstly, we must prioritize sustainable agricultural intensification – a concept that goes beyond mere yield increases to encompass the judicious use of inputs, conservation of natural resources, and resilience to climate change. This entails promoting agroecological approaches that leverage ecological processes to enhance productivity while minimizing adverse environmental impacts.

However, increasing production alone is insufficient; we must also address the systemic inequities that impede access to nutritious food. This requires concerted efforts to strengthen local and regional food systems, empower smallholder farmers, and promote equitable distribution mechanisms. Initiatives such as community-supported agriculture, urban agriculture, and food policy councils can play a pivotal role in fostering food sovereignty and reducing food deserts in marginalized communities.

Crucially, we must also confront the paradox of obesity and overnutrition, which now afflicts a substantial portion of the global population, often coexisting with undernutrition within the same communities (Popkin et al., 2020). This phenomenon is intrinsically linked to the proliferation of ultra-processed foods, aggressive marketing practices, and the erosion of traditional dietary patterns. Addressing this issue demands a multipronged approach involving public education, regulation of the food industry, and incentives for healthier food choices.

Furthermore, the pursuit of SDG 2 cannot be divorced from the broader environmental context. Climate change, biodiversity loss, and land degradation pose existential threats to food production systems worldwide. Consequently, we must embrace regenerative agriculture practices that prioritize soil health, water conservation, and ecosystem restoration. Agroforestry, conservation agriculture, and integrated pest management offer promising pathways for enhancing resilience and mitigating environmental impacts.

Notably, achieving SDG 2 is not merely a technical endeavor but a deeply political and socioeconomic one. It requires dismantling entrenched power structures, challenging vested interests, and empowering marginalized communities. This necessitates a concerted effort to reform policies, regulations, and institutional frameworks that perpetuate inequities and undermine food sovereignty.

In this regard, the global governance of food systems is paramount. Multilateral efforts, such as the Committee on World Food Security (CFS) and the UN Decade of Family Farming, provide crucial platforms for fostering dialogue, coordination, and policy coherence. However, these initiatives must be complemented by robust national and local governance mechanisms that prioritize the needs and voices of smallholder farmers, indigenous communities, and marginalized urban populations.

Ultimately, eradicating hunger and achieving food security is not merely a moral imperative but a fundamental prerequisite for sustainable development. It is a challenge that transcends disciplinary boundaries and requires a concerted, multisectoral effort involving policymakers, scientists, civil society organizations, and local communities. Only through a holistic, systems-based approach that addresses the root causes of food insecurity can we truly realize the transformative potential of SDG 2 and pave the way for a more just, equitable, and sustainable food future.
