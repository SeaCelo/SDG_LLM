Ending Hunger by 2030 - The High Stakes for Global Food Security

By the WSJ Editorial Board

As world leaders gather for the United Nations General Assembly this week, one issue lurks in the background with profound implications for global stability and economic growth: hunger. The goal of achieving zero hunger by 2030 has become an uphill battle in the face of compounding crises. From the Covid-19 pandemic to the Ukraine war and climate change, major setbacks have reversed hard-fought progress, pushing millions back into the clutches of food insecurity and malnutrition.

According to the latest State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World report, as many as 828 million people faced hunger in 2021 - a staggering rise of 150 million since the outbreak of the pandemic. In a world of immense wealth and technological prowess, these figures are unacceptable, representing not just a moral failure but an existential threat to human capital and economic advancement.  

"Hunger is no longer just a problem of food production, but increasingly one of poverty, access and affordability," remarked David Beasley, Executive Director of the World Food Programme. The converging forces of conflict, economic shocks, and extreme weather events have disrupted supply chains, driving up food and fuel costs beyond the reach of the world's most vulnerable populations.

For agribusiness leaders and investors, eliminating hunger by 2030 represents both an immense challenge and a colossal commercial opportunity. Meeting demand from a projected 9.7 billion people by mid-century will require an overhaul of global food systems and supply chains - one that emphasizes efficiency, sustainability, and resilience to shocks.

Innovation holds the key, from precision agriculture and biotechnology to supply chain digitization and improved market access for smallholder farmers. "We need to produce more with less in a smarter way," explains Dr. Agnes Kalibata, President of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa. "Innovation is no longer optional if we want to feed 10 billion people while restoring degraded land and minimizing emissions."

Public-private partnerships will play a pivotal role in driving the R&D breakthroughs and capital investment needed. DuPont subsidiary Corteva Agriscience has committed over $800 million to develop seed technologies that enhance productivity and tolerance to drought, insects and disease. Meanwhile, AgTech startups like Taranis are deploying AI and aerial imagery to help growers boost yields and cut costs through precise, data-driven farm intelligence.  

Yet, beyond boosting production, unlocking developing world markets for food trade represents an underexplored frontier. According to the World Bank, upgrading logistics and removing cross-border constraints could boost agricultural and food exports by up to $1 trillion across South Asia, Middle East, and sub-Saharan Africa. As Christine Gould of the Rockefeller Foundation argues, "Bottlenecks in the food supply chain capture huge economic rents, driving up costs for consumers."

While the challenges are daunting, achieving SDG 2 is an imperative with immense payoffs - not just in human welfare but in fueling economic growth, political stability, and environmental sustainability for decades to come. As the UN's Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs recently stated, "Alleviating hunger is about more than just calorie intake. It's about giving the world's most vulnerable children a chance at life and creating a more peaceful and prosperous global community." The stakes for concerted action could not be higher.
