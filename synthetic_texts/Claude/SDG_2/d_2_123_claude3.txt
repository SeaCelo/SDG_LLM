Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger), written from the perspective of the late British writer and critic A.A. Gill in his characteristically biting, irreverent style:

The Shameful Scourge of Hunger in an Age of Plenty

By A.A. Gill

Despite the breathtaking advances of the modern world, the fact that hundreds of millions of people go to bed hungry each night is a moral atrocity that should shame us all. The second of the much-vaunted Sustainable Development Goals calls for an end to hunger, the achieving of food security, improved nutrition, and the promotion of sustainable agriculture by 2030. A noble aim, to be sure, but one fears it is more empty rhetorical piffle from the sort of bien pensant handwringers who excel at well-meaning multinational jaw-jaw while real people starve.

Let's be clear - while hunger numbers have declined over the past two decades, an estimated 690 million men, women and children still suffered from acute undernourishment in 2019. That's one in every 11 humans eking out a wretched, subhuman existence, bodies and minds stunted by chronic malnourishment. And these figures predate the upheaval of the COVID pandemic, which has doubtless made things far worse for the world's poor and hungry.

Of course, the causes are manifold - entrenched conflicts, forced displacement, economic calamities and market failures, the exhaust fumes of war, pestilence, and short-sighted governance. But at its heart hunger is about power, politics and priorities. Put simply, we produce more than enough food for everyone on a planetary basis. There is no inevitable scarcity - just a self-inflicted, grotesque failure to distribute resources fairly and sustainably.

The reality is that nearly a third of global food production is lost or goes to waste each year. All along the supply chain, in fields, during transportation and storage, at markets, and in our palatial homes, perfectly edible foodstuffs are squandered on an industrial scale. It is a travesty, a manifestation of the utter disdain we reserve for those we barely consider human. 

While the world's huddled masses subsist on pigeon feed and forage in urban detritus, we in the plump, rose-tinted west treat food as mere frippery. Our zaftig kin hunger for the latest faddish superfood, only to chuck it out when the next panacea comes slithering along to part them from their cash. Food banks ration meager rations while the 1% delicately elevates its pinky at $1,000 tasting menus washed down with vin de pampre at $800 a bottle.

The bitter truth is that we don't suffer from a shortage of supply so much as a pathological indifference bordering on malice. We could easily grow and distribute more than enough calories to feed everyone. Yet the agro-industrial juggernaut ruthlessly squanders land, water and energy in an orgy of inefficiency while a billion souls need no longer go to bed famished.

Consider the arable land, forests and water sources consumed to produce grain for cattle at a time of rising hunger and falling reserves of fresh water. Or the mountains of wholesome but deformed produce rejected by supermarkets each year for specious cosmetic reasons, cast into landfills to rot while the impoverished scrape by. If you somehow doubt the depths of human indecency, consider the UN's estimate that a mere fraction of the money spent annually on global armaments would be enough to eradicate hunger everywhere.

Our crowning achievement as a species is not technological or artistic but ethical - enshrining selfishness, egotism and the relentless cult of individualism in the face of so much agony. What salvation is there from the sneering caliginosity of willful starvation when there is such bottomless abundance all around? The antidote to grisly want is well within our grasp. All that is lacking is the moral courage and political will to deploy it decisively.

So by all means, continue tut-tutting about Sustainable Development Goals and other pablum at the high tabled of the United Nations. Their real worth, however, will only be proved when the sort of hunger from which millions perish is truly eradicated, not just locally or temporarily alleviated. Until then, we shall remain no better than the soulless grifters and oleaginous lackeys presiding over a global scandal of greed, waste and preventable suffering. For shame. For all our sakes, for shame.
