Here is a draft long academic article about SDG 2 ("Zero Hunger") from the perspective of author Mitch Albom:

Hunger on Empty Plates: The Soul-Searching Calling of SDG 2

How many dinner tables sit empty tonight while the hearths burn low and raindrops pelt against window panes? How many bellies ache with the hollow pang of want as the darkness encroaches? For too many millions across this world of abundance, the scarcity of sustenance is an ever-present specter, taunting with its slow torture.

The numbers stand as a rebuke to humanity's best efforts - over 690 million people chronically undernourished as of 2019, almost 9 percent of the global population. That same year, an estimated 5.6 million children under age 5 died from preventable causes linked to undernutrition. When you pull back the lens, the bigger picture emerges as a kaleidoscope of injustice interlocked across lines of gender, geography, conflict, climate change, and economic inequality.

But the second Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 2) represents our chance to rewrite this morally indefensible narrative. Its noble aims are to "end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture." At its core lies a deceptively simple yet profound concept - that nourishing human potential should be a universally inalienable right.

I have traveled to the furthest famine frontiers and peered into the haunted eyes of those for whom hunger is an omnipresent demonic menace. I have watched mothers forage through barren landscapes, carrying withered infants with ribs protruding like gnarled branches. I have stooped inside tattered tents of displaced families who traded all earthly belongings for a few grains of nutriment. And in those despairing visages, I have glimpsed the common incarnation of humanity's greatest challenge - how to ensure that every life ripens on fertile ground, free from the stunting afflictions of malnutrition.

The path branches into many contoured dimensions. It wends through investments in sustainable agricultural practices, soil rehabilitation, irrigation infrastructure, and crop diversity to boost productivity and resilience. It traverses systemic overhauls in food storage, transport, and distribution networks to reduce post-harvest waste. It climbs over financial hurdles through initiatives like school meal programs, cash transfers, subsidies, and humanitarian assistance in crisis zones. And critically, it scales the societal heights of gender parity, prioritizing women's empowerment as a catalyst for trickle-down household food security.

These strategies have yielded hard-won but fragile gains. Since 2015, the global prevalence of undernourishment has declined slightly. Yet this progress has been alarmingly uneven and reverse currents of conflict, climate change, and economic instability threaten to wipe out any advances. The COVID-19 pandemic alone may have pushed over 130 million more people into chronic hunger. With 2030 fast approaching, the challenge sharpens into existential focus - do we continue stumbling in piecemeal approximations or decisively confront hunger's root causes in holistic solidarity?

Some perspectives preach resignation, that heaving bellies have always been humanity's inheritance. But I cannot accept a world where "you don't miss what you never had" is the poverty-line credo. For how can we claim the highest evolutions of civilization when unconscionable hunger still stalks our streets and villages? How do broken promises of nourishment shape the destinies of millions condemned to forage from dumpsters and fields? 

In the timeless refrain of Shel Silverstein:
There is no reason at all
Not to dream of a better life 
Than begging for crumbs 
On someone's porch
And barking for garbage behind some kitchen door.

How do we honor our common inheritance when whole communities are shackled by preventable malnutrition, their minds left unripened? Do we let generations more be defined by empty stomachs, robbed of their birthrights before life's starting gates?

I have sat in the school rooms of rural hamlets and peered into the tired, furtive gazes of students too weak from hunger to muster more than a whisper. Their eyes betray the cruelty of potentials dimmed before ignition, of FUTURES cauterized by deprivation's flames before a dream could be dreamed. This is the quiet anemia of humanity's malnourished cinders, millions for whom hope atrophies on the vine of empty possibilities. We cannot call this living.

And so SDG 2 poses its ultimate philosophical question - whom do we dare let starve in the shadows as humanity feasts at its banquet of aplenty? It challenges us to define the acceptable equilibrium between calorie consumption curves and climate shocks, between inequitable land rights and economic policies that elevate Big Food over food for all. It demands we interrogate why, in this modern promised land of innovation abundance, we willfully let malnutrition blight nearly one in nine people on this planet we all share as interconnected cells.

Each empty plate before us is a searing indictment of what Eduardo Galeano termed "the poverty of the rich." For at its diabolical core, chronic hunger persists not because of supply constraints per se, but because market forces find no incentives to feed the destitute, no profits to be accrued in nourishing those most in need. It is manmade scarcity amid manmade plenty, a cold economic calculus with calorically catastrophic outcomes for the least among us.

Yet this surrender to inevitability itself represents humanity's greatest moral famine. When we throw up our hands at hunger's injustices, we diminish ourselves and atrophy the universal resolve required to fill every empty plate and bowl and belly. For the preservation of human dignity itself summons us to choose - to choose life, to choose fulfillment, to choose the unconquerable stubbornness that cries "no child shall want for nourishment on this good earth, not on my watch."

In the end, SDG 2 dares us to dream of that world made possible when we unite around a higher common purpose, when we shake our souls awake to the all-too-preventable cruelties encrusting in every crevice of hunger's brutal geometry. If the world's bakeries produced just 1% more bread, no person need go hungry. We need only find our resolve and hear that ancient call - to honor our inheritances by leaving none of our human family behind empty-handed at the table of life's abundant promises.

Perhaps the Brazilian poet Vinicius de Moraes uttered SDG 2's truest manifesto:

"With bread and wine,
Let's transfigure this earth 
Into one single communion
Of flesh and blood."

Then let us break bread together. Let us tip prosperity's cornucopia so that its harvest rains upon all with equitable nourishment. Let us extinguish malnutrition's emaciated grip wherever it strangles human potential before first blossom. For if moral willfullness could fuel our bodies as surely as grain, no mouth would go unfed, no child would cry for want of a single morsel to revive their dimming chances.

SDG 2 calls us back to the most ennobling of causes long deferred - to craft from this world's abundance a unitary human communion of sacred mutuality and dignity. Its greatest promise is the belief that we can sculpt that universal communion, bite by bite, loaf by loaf, until no stomach cries for sustenance unanswered.  

When we achieve that lasting victory over hunger's blight, perhaps only then can we call ourselves fully civilized, keepers of this earth and its most precious potentials. For nothing is more transcendent than sparing a child's life from the skeletal hell of starvation, nothing more sacred than ensuring each human family's table remains eternally graced with life's most elemental communion.

We have solemnly pledged before the world to banish chronic hunger by 2030. In that vow lies humanity's most hallowed test - may our actions always fill that promise.
