Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger), written from the perspective of Joshua D. Angrist, the award-winning economist and empirical methods expert:

Achieving food security and promoting sustainable agriculture requires innovative solutions built on rigorous causal evidence. As an economist focused on natural experiments and credible counterfactuals, I approach SDG 2 through the lens of the potential outcomes framework. We must move beyond observational data and correlations to identify strategies with robust, unbiased impact.

A foundational challenge is measuring hunger itself. The prevalence of undernourishment provides one perspective, but anthropometric data like stunting rates may better capture the multidimensional nature of malnutrition. An instrumental variables approach linking geographic or climatic conditions to nutritional inputs could sharpen these measurements.

On the demand side, conditional cash transfers have shown promise in bolstering food consumption among the poor. However, general equilibrium effects and poor targeting hamper scalability. A way forward may be two-stage stratified treatment assignment, creating arbitrary variation in eligibility within well-defined populations. This design allows cleanly estimating distributional impacts across socioeconomic strata.

Sustainable agricultural productivity growth is key on the supply side. The seminal work of Michael Kremer and colleagues demonstrated positive social returns to developing and disseminating higher-yielding seed varieties using a pipeline quasi-experimental approach. A next frontier is harnessing big data from remote sensing and geographic information systems to optimize input mixes and spatial allocation of crops. Machine learning methods applied to high-dimensional observational data may uncover profitable agricultural intensification pathways. 

However, boosting production alone is insufficient; smallholder market access must improve. A neglected opportunity is reducing post-harvest losses through better transportation, storage, and processing infrastructure. Regression discontinuity designs based on road network topology or warehouse location could capture local average treatment effects.

Looking ahead, a threat multiplier is climate change-induced extreme weather and environmental degradation. Leveraging exogenous spatial-temporal variation in farmer behavior, plausibly random climate shocks provide a promising basis for estimating resilience-enhancing practices. Clustered randomization of drought-resistant seed varieties, irrigation investments, insurance schemes and agroforestry interventions would also expand the evidence base.

Advancing our understanding of how to comprehensively end hunger in all its forms requires no shortage of empirical agenda-setting. From measurement systems and consumer demand studies to farm productivity and market integration initiatives, rigorous causal evaluation based on real-world natural experiments must remain a north star. While daunting, with creativity and econometric credibility, our quest for Sustainable Development Goal 2 is within reach.
