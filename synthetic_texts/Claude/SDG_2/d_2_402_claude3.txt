CARE's Analytical Report on Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger

As an organization dedicated to alleviating poverty and promoting sustainable development, CARE recognizes the critical importance of Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2): Zero Hunger. This ambitious goal seeks to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030. Despite significant progress in recent decades, the world still faces staggering challenges in eradicating hunger and malnutrition, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and ongoing conflicts.

The detrimental impacts of hunger and malnutrition are far-reaching and interconnected. Chronic undernutrition during critical periods of growth and development can have lifelong consequences, including stunted physical and cognitive development, increased susceptibility to infectious diseases, and reduced productivity and earning potential later in life. Additionally, malnutrition disproportionately affects women and children, perpetuating a vicious cycle of poverty and inequality.

Achieving SDG 2 requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the root causes of hunger and malnutrition, while simultaneously promoting sustainable and resilient agricultural practices. One of the key strategies employed by CARE is the promotion of climate-smart agriculture. This approach combines traditional knowledge with modern techniques to enhance productivity, resilience, and sustainability. For instance, in the drought-prone regions of East Africa, CARE has worked with smallholder farmers to adopt water-efficient irrigation methods, drought-resistant crop varieties, and soil conservation practices. These interventions not only increase yields but also enhance the resilience of farming communities to the impacts of climate change.

Moreover, CARE recognizes the critical role of gender equality in achieving food security and nutrition. Women often bear the brunt of food insecurity and play a pivotal role in agricultural production and household nutrition. By empowering women through improved access to resources, education, and decision-making processes, CARE aims to enhance household food security and overall well-being. For example, in Bangladesh, CARE's Strengthening the Dairy Value Chain project has provided training and resources to women dairy farmers, enabling them to increase their incomes and improve their families' nutrition.

Addressing malnutrition requires a multisectoral approach that encompasses not only food production but also access to clean water, sanitation, and healthcare services. CARE's integrated programming combines interventions in agriculture, water and sanitation, healthcare, and education to holistically address the underlying causes of malnutrition. In Nepal, CARE's Suaahara II project has successfully reduced stunting rates through a combination of maternal and child health services, nutrition education, and the promotion of diversified diets.

Achieving SDG 2 also necessitates strong partnerships and collaborations at all levels. CARE works closely with local communities, governments, and other stakeholders to ensure that interventions are culturally appropriate, sustainable, and aligned with national priorities. Additionally, CARE advocates for policy changes that promote food security, sustainable agriculture, and the empowerment of marginalized groups, such as smallholder farmers and women.

While significant progress has been made, the path to achieving SDG 2 remains challenging. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated food insecurity and disrupted supply chains, setting back years of progress. Climate change continues to threaten agricultural productivity and food systems, particularly in vulnerable regions. Conflicts and political instability further compound these challenges, disrupting food production and distribution, and displacing populations.
