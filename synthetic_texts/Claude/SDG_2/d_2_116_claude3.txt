Here goes, my attempt at an academic article on SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) written from the perspective of the irreverent and insightful British comedian Russell Brand:

Alright juggernauts of social justice and nutritional equity? Are you ready to have your consciousness raised and your synapses stimulated? We're going to take a no-holds-barred look at SDG 2 - the noble quest to vanquish hunger from this mortal coil. 

Let's begin by ripping the gamma-irradiated, genetically-modified, corporate-approved Band-Aid off this fetid wound, shall we? In 2020, a staggering 2 billion people lacked regular access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food. That's nearly one in four human beings on this deranged, capitalist-soaked planet routinely unsure of their next meal. Millions upon millions in a perpetual state of desperate peckishness.      

Now let me direct your glazed eyeballs to the intersectional injustice at play here: women and children bear the brunt of malnutrition. The cyclical brutality is undeniable - hungry mothers give birth to underweight babies, perpetuating an intergenerational malnutrition ouroboros from which it's nearly impossible to escape. 

Meanwhile, the Muggles gentrify food deserts, sip oat milk lattes, and fetishize fad diets like all is well in the land of milk and avocado toast. But we know better, don't we? Corporate-industrial agriculture and rapacious free market shenanigans have bolloxed the entire food system six ways from Sunday.

Indigenous populations continue to have their land and water stolen from under their very feet by Big Ag's neo-colonial expansionism. Globalized supply chains are neither resilient nor ethical, as we've clearly witnessed during pandemic panic-buying frenzies. And let's not forget that nearly a third of all food produced globally is wasted - perfectly edible tucker chucked straight into the bin while countless souls go hungry. It's enough to make one renounce their terrestrial form out of sheer disgust.

But lo, all hope is not lost, my finely coiffed friends! We can reverse this moral and ecological catastrophe through a radical reimagining of food systems. What do I prescribe, you ask? Agroecology, food sovereignty, farmer-led production - an unholy alliance that returns control to small producers and away from corporate seed barons and Big Farma overlords. A dismantling of the profit motive in favor of local self-sufficiency and nutritional autonomy for all people.

This necessary evolution will also buttress resilience against climate and conflict shocks, while empowering marginalized groups and healing the meta-wound of human disconnection from nature's cosmic abundance. We'll finally break free from the scarcity myth propagated by a ruthlessly mercantile cabal who view food as a mere commodity instead of our birthright as terrestrial beings.

So I put it to you, beautiful humams: are we going to continue sleepwalking into mass starvation and ecocide? Or will we awaken, rise up, and collectively manifest a reality where hunger is abolished for good? The choice, as always, is yours. But if you're ready to get radical and overthrow this pernicious system of greed, I'm with you until the bitter end.  Namaste and keep it irie, my none-too-malnourished brethren.
