In this analytical report, the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) scrutinizes the progress and challenges surrounding the attainment of Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) – "Zero Hunger" – with a particular emphasis on the unique circumstances faced by Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Small Island Developing States (SIDS), and Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs).

Despite remarkable strides in reducing global hunger over the past three decades, the world remains plagued by persistently high levels of food insecurity, malnutrition, and stunting, particularly in the most vulnerable regions and nations. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these challenges, reversing years of progress and pushing millions into extreme poverty and hunger. LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs bear the brunt of this crisis, grappling with compounding factors that imperil their quest for sustainable food systems and nutrition security.

LDCs, characterized by low incomes, structural impediments, and limited resilience, face daunting obstacles in eradicating hunger and malnutrition. Chronic underinvestment in agriculture, infrastructure deficits, and limited access to technology and finance constrain their agricultural productivity and hinder the development of robust value chains. Furthermore, climate change impacts, such as droughts, floods, and soil degradation, exacerbate food insecurity and threaten the livelihoods of smallholder farmers, who constitute the backbone of rural economies in many LDCs.

SIDS confront unique challenges stemming from their geographic remoteness, limited natural resources, and vulnerability to climate change and natural disasters. Their heavy reliance on imported food, coupled with high transportation costs and limited economies of scale, renders them susceptible to price volatility and supply disruptions in global markets. Moreover, the degradation of coastal and marine ecosystems, driven by factors like overfishing, pollution, and rising sea levels, jeopardizes the food security and livelihoods of coastal communities.

LLDCs face distinct obstacles in achieving SDG 2 due to their lack of direct territorial access to the sea, reliance on transit countries, and high transportation costs for imports and exports. These factors impede their integration into regional and global markets, hindering their ability to diversify food sources and access affordable, nutritious food. Additionally, LLDCs often grapple with limited arable land, water scarcity, and inadequate infrastructure, posing significant barriers to agricultural development and food production.

Addressing these multifaceted challenges requires a holistic and coordinated approach that recognizes the unique vulnerabilities and contexts of LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs. Targeted investments in climate-resilient agriculture, sustainable fisheries management, and infrastructure development are crucial to bolstering food production, improving market access, and enhancing value chains. Moreover, fostering regional cooperation and strengthening intra-regional trade can mitigate the impacts of geographic isolation and facilitate the exchange of agricultural goods and technologies.

Crucially, the international community must prioritize capacity-building and technology transfer to equip these countries with the tools and expertise necessary to adapt to climate change, leverage sustainable agricultural practices, and develop resilient food systems. Innovative financing mechanisms, such as blended finance and climate funds, can catalyze investments in climate-smart agriculture, water management, and rural infrastructure.

Furthermore, addressing the root causes of food insecurity and malnutrition necessitates a multisectoral approach that encompasses social protection programs, nutrition education, and the empowerment of women and marginalized communities. By promoting inclusive and equitable access to productive resources, markets, and decision-making processes, these initiatives can contribute to breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty and hunger.

In conclusion, achieving SDG 2 in LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs requires a concerted and context-specific effort that addresses the unique challenges faced by these countries. By fostering resilient and sustainable food systems, promoting inclusive economic growth, and prioritizing climate adaptation and mitigation strategies, the global community can pave the way for a world free from hunger, malnutrition, and poverty.
