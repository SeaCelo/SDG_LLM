Here is a draft academic article on SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) from the perspective of Margaret Wente, a Canadian journalist known for her contrarian and critical views:

The Illusive Quest for a Well-Fed World: Why the Zero Hunger Goal Remains a Pipe Dream

By Margaret Wente

If there's one sustainable development goal that should be achievable, it's Zero Hunger. Feeding the world's population seems straightforward compared to reducing inequality or mitigating climate change. Yet almost a decade after the UN's ambitious agenda was endorsed, undernourishment rates remain stubbornly high in many parts of the world. What are we getting wrong?

The technical solutions are well known – improving agricultural productivity, increasing investment in rural infrastructure, promoting sustainable farming practices, and enhancing access to nutritious food. But effective implementation has proven incredibly difficult, hampered by corruption, poor governance, conflicts, and environmental degradation.

Take the situation in sub-Saharan Africa, which has the highest prevalence of hunger globally. Despite an outpouring of aid and myriad food security initiatives, the number of undernourished people on the continent has actually increased by 44 million since 2015. Famine still stalks displacement camps in South Sudan and Somalia. In Zimbabwe, a brutal economic collapse fueled by disastrous land policies has left millions dependent on food aid.

Even in rapidly growing economies like India, childhood stunting from malnutrition remains at unconscionable levels – a stain on the nation's development story. India's primary school meals program, though well-intentioned, has failed to deliver adequate calories and nutrition due to mind-boggling mismanagement and graft.  

The neo-Malthusian doomsayers who warned of mass starvation from overpopulation look to have been wrong – at least so far. Buoyed by the Green Revolution, global food production has managed to outpace population growth. The real challenge lies in distribution, affordability and stability of supply. But the triumphs of agricultural innovation are being offset by new threats like soil degradation, water scarcity, and climate shocks.

Achieving zero hunger isn't just about growing more food, it's about reforming dysfunctional systems and shifting how we think about food security. Too many international aid programs have focused on temporary handouts rather than building long-term resilience and self-sufficiency. Cash transfer programs, while promising, are a partial solution at best if not accompanied by efforts to overhaul inefficient markets, land tenure systems and governance failures that trap people in poverty.  

It's also increasingly clear that hunger and malnutrition must be decoupled. In affluent nations like the United States and Canada, nutritional deficits paradoxically coexist alongside obesity epidemics for a subset of the population - the outcome of poverty, poor dietary choices fueled by cheap calories, and lack of nutrition education. The zero hunger agenda can't ignore the double burden of malnutrition affecting rich and poor nations alike.

For all its good intentions, the zero hunger campaign smacks of the utopian overreach that has plagued previous development efforts. Hunger is a complex, multi-causal challenge interlinked with conflict, gender inequality, climate change and other socio-economic forces. Isolated technocratic efforts are bound to disappointing results.

What's needed is an approach that enhances local democratic institutions, empowers civil society, and enlists the private sector as a partner rather than just looking to NGOs and governments for solutions. Unless the zero hunger agenda is decentralized, grounded in specific contexts, and backed by rigorous measurement systems and accountability mechanisms, it risks becoming another ineffectual, top-down plan authored by an oblivious bureaucratic elite.

Some may accuse me of cynicism. But after decades of lofty development schemes heralded as potential game-changers, only to fade into obscurity and hollow rhetoric, it's hard not to be a skeptic. Only by taking an unflinching look at why past efforts have faltered can we stand a chance at getting food security right.
