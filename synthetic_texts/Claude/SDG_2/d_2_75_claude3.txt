Here is a detailed long academic article about SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), written from the perspective of conservative author Mark Steyn:

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 2 to "end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture" is a quintessential example of a utopian pipe dream that Western progressives foist upon the world with reckless abandon. As a proud conservative climate change skeptic, I find the entire premise laughable - the notion that throwing money at central planners and empowering multinational bureaucracies can somehow solve the age-old challenges of hunger, malnutrition and agrarian poverty is farcical.

Let's start with some hard truths the UN prefers to ignore. Despite Gaia-worshipping environmentalists warning for decades of imminent food shortages, global agricultural production has increased exponentially. We produce more than enough calories to feed humanity; hunger is a logistical and economic failure, not an inescapable Malthusian trap. The real issues are food waste, inadequate infrastructure, misguided agricultural policies, and bad governance in chronically undernourished regions. 

Take sub-Saharan Africa, for example. While urban megacities like Lagos continue expanding unchecked, a majority of the population remains rural peasant farmers stuck in pre-industrial age subsistence farming. With rapidly growing populations and widespread lack of property rights or modern farming techniques, is it any surprise these countries cannot feed themselves reliably? Corrupt and dysfunctional governments exacerbate shortages through civil conflicts, failed socialist economic policies, and denying economic freedom. No amount of Western aid can counteract such systematic governance meltdowns.

The UN's sustainable agriculture goal exposes the inherent contradictions of cultural Marxism. They sanctimoniously promote ancient, inefficient traditional farming methods while simultaneously lamenting low yields and ecological degradation. Has it not occurred to these bio-friendly morons that productive modern agriculture - fertilizers, pesticides, GMOs and all - is the only way to increase food security while sparing more land for nature? Industrial farming is sustainable, while labor-intensive subsistence farming leads to ecological devastation as marginal lands are cultivated. Go to Malawi or Mali, and you'll see the natural habitats sacrificed to back-breaking preindustrial farming practices.

Of course, it's the Western world that is constantly berated for being the prime driver of hunger and poverty in the developing world. That malnutrition persists globally is attributed not to anti-modern ideologies or intractable kleptocracies holding back the Third World, but to the "injustices" of free trade, biotechnology, and market economics. It's far easier to blame western agriculture for success rather than come to terms with the failures of statist self-reliance and technological primitivism.

The bitter truth is that the grand pronouncements of the UN Sustainable Development Goals are an exercise in lavish utopian fantasies disconnected from reality on the ground across much of the world. Western environmentalists have become enthralled by the noble savage myth - the idea that remote villagers live in harmony with nature and hold the secrets to sustainability. It's delusional cultural romanticism that has calcified the developing world into perpetual poverty and food insecurity. The UN's anti-modern ideology is precisely what perpetuates hunger and suffering on a mass scale.
