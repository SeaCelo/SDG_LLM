The European Investment Bank recognizes the critical importance of achieving Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) – "Zero Hunger" – and has been actively investing in projects and initiatives aimed at addressing this global challenge. Despite significant progress in recent decades, the world continues to grapple with the persistent issues of hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition, exacerbated by factors such as climate change, conflicts, and economic instability.

In our comprehensive analysis, we have identified several key areas that require immediate attention and strategic investment to accelerate progress towards SDG 2. One of the most pressing concerns is the impact of climate change on agricultural systems and food production. Rising temperatures, unpredictable weather patterns, and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events pose significant threats to crop yields, livestock productivity, and the overall stability of food supply chains. Investing in climate-resilient agricultural practices, such as drought-resistant crop varieties, sustainable irrigation systems, and innovative technologies for precision farming, is crucial to ensuring food security in the face of these challenges.

Another critical area of focus is the promotion of sustainable and diversified agricultural systems. Monoculture practices and reliance on resource-intensive methods have contributed to soil degradation, biodiversity loss, and environmental pollution. By supporting the transition towards agroecological approaches, such as integrated pest management, crop rotation, and the incorporation of indigenous knowledge, we can enhance the long-term productivity and resilience of agricultural systems while minimizing their environmental footprint.

Furthermore, addressing the issue of food loss and waste should be a top priority. It is estimated that approximately one-third of all food produced globally is lost or wasted, representing a significant squandering of resources and contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. Investing in improved storage and transportation infrastructure, as well as promoting sustainable consumption patterns and raising awareness about food waste, can have a substantial impact on reducing this inefficiency and ensuring that food reaches those who need it most.

Empowering smallholder farmers and supporting their access to resources, markets, and financial services is another critical component of our strategy. Smallholder farmers, particularly in developing countries, play a vital role in food production, yet they often face numerous challenges, including limited access to credit, inputs, and modern technologies. By investing in initiatives that provide training, access to financing, and market linkages, we can enhance the productivity and profitability of smallholder operations, contributing to rural development and improved food security.

Additionally, we recognize the importance of addressing the underlying socio-economic and political factors that contribute to hunger and malnutrition. Investing in initiatives that promote gender equality, access to education, and inclusive governance can empower communities and individuals, enabling them to take control of their food security and break the cycle of poverty and hunger.

Through our investments and partnerships, we aim to foster collaboration among various stakeholders, including governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector. By leveraging our financial resources and expertise, we can catalyze transformative change and drive innovative solutions that address the multifaceted challenges of achieving SDG 2.

Achieving zero hunger requires a holistic and coordinated approach that addresses the interconnected social, economic, and environmental dimensions of this global challenge. At the European Investment Bank, we remain committed to supporting sustainable and resilient food systems, promoting inclusive and equitable access to resources, and fostering a world where no one is left behind in the pursuit of food security.
