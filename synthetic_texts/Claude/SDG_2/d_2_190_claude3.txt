Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), written from the perspective of Ben Shapiro:

The Sustainable Development Goal of Zero Hunger is one that demands serious philosophical and pragmatic scrutiny. At its core, this objective presupposes a collectivist notion of resource allocation and wealth redistribution that should give any freedom-loving individual pause. The idea that ending hunger necessitates top-down governance and economic intervention is anathema to the principles of individualism and free markets that have proven so integral to prosperity.

That said, the realities of malnutrition and starvation across the developing world are indeed grim. Hundreds of millions lack reliable access to sufficient calories and nutrients - a humanitarian crisis with devastating implications for human flourishing. No moral person can be indifferent to such widespread deprivation and suffering. The question then becomes how best to ameliorate this plight in a manner consistent with individual liberty.

The left's conventional wisdom holds that more aid, wealth transfers, and centralized agricultural policies are the solution. However, this Washington consensus ignores the repeated failures of such efforts and the disastrous unintended consequences of disrupting price signals and market dynamics. From nutritional deprivation in the Soviet Union to the modern disasters of Venezuela's socialist policies, history is littered with examples of command economics breeding scarcity rather than plenty.

A more nuanced examination would reveal that many of the root causes of hunger stem from systemic corruption, fragile democracy and rule of law, poor infrastructure, lack of property rights, and overreliance on subsistence farming. Repressive policies, civil unrest, and regressive traditional practices are equally culpable. Indeed, in regions with economic freedom and stable governance, free trade and market forces have proven remarkably effective at increasing food security.

Juxtaposing India's wasteful populism and disastrous price controls against China's deregulation and agricultural privatization policies is instructive. While India languished in turmoil, malnutrition, and the specter of famine for decades, China's pivot toward markets rapidly improved caloric intake and food availability despite a population explosion. A similar story can be told of post-Soviet economic liberalization and rural development across much of the former Eastern Bloc.

If the objective is genuinely to emancipate the global poor from the scourge of hunger, the evidence strongly suggests that market-oriented policy reforms are a prerequisite. Eliminating corruption, entrenching property rights, enabling free trade of agricultural goods, and incentivizing sustainable rural investment must be prioritized over counterproductive wealth transfers. Promoting democratic institutions, economic freedom, and openness to productivity-enhancing technologies like genetically modified foods is crucial.

NGOs and conscious consumers have an important role in directly addressing acute crises and raising awareness, to be sure. But lasting solutions demand that we realign institutional incentives, catalyze entrepreneurialism, and promulgate ideas that respect human rights and human flourishing through voluntary exchange rather than coercion.    

The road to zero hunger does not lie in discredited collectivist philosophies that centralize control over the means of production and violate economic laws, however well-intentioned. History's universal lesson is that societies which embrace individual liberty, free markets, and democratic capitalism reliably outperform their counterparts in elevating living standards and increasing abundance. Achieving SDG 2 necessitates a pragmatic acceptance of this reality.
