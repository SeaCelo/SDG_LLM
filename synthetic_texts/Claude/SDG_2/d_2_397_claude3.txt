The pursuit of Sustainable Development Goal 2 – Zero Hunger – has been a central focus for the Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN) over the past several decades. Our multi-input area development approach, which integrates efforts across sectors like agriculture, education, healthcare, and infrastructure, has allowed us to tackle the multifaceted challenge of hunger and malnutrition in innovative ways.

One of our signature initiatives has been the Introduction of New Technologies in Agriculture (INRA) program, which has been implemented across multiple regions where we operate. INRA takes a holistic view of agricultural development, combining cutting-edge research with farmer training, input supply chains, and market linkages. For instance, in Mozambique, we have worked with local partners to develop and disseminate improved drought-tolerant varieties of cassava and sweet potato, which have increased yields by up to 40% in vulnerable areas. Complementing this, our extension services have trained over 50,000 smallholder farmers on sustainable agronomic practices, crop diversification, and post-harvest management techniques.

Another key focus has been boosting productivity and incomes in livestock value chains, which are a critical livelihood source for many rural communities. In Afghanistan, our comprehensive dairy development program has introduced improved cattle breeds, fodder production systems, veterinary services, and milk collection networks. This has increased dairy yields by over 60% for participating households. Moreover, we have facilitated the establishment of women-led dairy cooperatives, enhancing agency and economic empowerment.

Recognizing the interconnected nature of hunger, poverty, and environmental degradation, we have actively promoted climate-smart agricultural practices. For example, in Tajikistan, our Pamir region initiative has implemented sloping land management techniques, including terracing and agroforestry, protecting fragile mountain ecosystems while improving soil quality and water retention. We have also played a pioneering role in the development of ethical certified premium value chains for products like cotton, cashews, and coffee, creating sustainable economic opportunities for smallholder farmers.

Crucially, our interventions extend beyond the farm level, addressing systemic bottlenecks across the entire food value chain. We have invested in post-harvest infrastructure like cold storage facilities, processing units, and rural feeder roads to reduce post-harvest losses and improve market access. In Kenya, our coastal rural support program has established a network of community-based grain banks, enabling smallholder farmers to bulk and store their produce, negotiate better prices, and mitigate the impacts of seasonal hunger gaps.

A hallmark of our approach has been the integration of nutrition interventions into our food security initiatives. Our nutrition programs have focused on promoting dietary diversity, fortification, and behavior change communication. For instance, in Pakistan, our collaboration with the government and local partners has led to the establishment of community-based management of acute malnutrition (CMAM) facilities, treating over 200,000 children suffering from severe acute malnutrition annually.

While substantial progress has been made, we recognize that achieving SDG 2 requires sustained, multi-stakeholder efforts driven by robust data and evidence. To this end, we have partnered with leading research institutions and UN agencies to conduct rigorous impact evaluations and policy analysis. For example, our collaboration with the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) has generated valuable insights into the linkages between agriculture, nutrition, and gender dynamics, informing the design of more effective interventions.

Looking ahead, we are committed to scaling up our efforts and exploring new frontiers in the fight against hunger and malnutrition. This includes leveraging emerging technologies like precision agriculture, digital extension services, and data-driven supply chain optimization. We are also actively exploring innovative financing mechanisms, such as blended finance and impact investing, to catalyze private sector engagement and unlock new sources of capital.

Ultimately, our approach to SDG 2 reflects the fundamental ethos of the AKDN – a holistic, ethical, and sustainable approach to development that empowers communities and creates enduring positive change. By collaborating with diverse partners, harnessing the power of innovation, and remaining firmly grounded in local contexts, we remain steadfast in our commitment to ensuring food security and eradicating hunger for generations to come.
