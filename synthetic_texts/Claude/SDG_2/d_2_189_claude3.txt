Hunger: The Quiet Plague Robbing Millions of Human Potential

By Mary Schmich

In the grand sweep of human history, our era will be remembered as one of breathtaking progress and unconscionable contradictions. We've cloned mammals, sent rovers to Mars, and bent the fabric of spacetime to our scientific will. Yet in this age of marvels, a most primal scourge still stalks the Earth, sapping the vigor and promise from nearly a billion souls.

I speak, of course, of hunger - the gnawing want of elemental sustenance that lays waste to bodies, minds, and the human spirit itself. It is poverty's cruelest hallmark, a slow anguish that degrades its victims from within while the abundance of plenty mocks from every storefront and groaning field.

The numbers are staggering: 811 million people today don't get enough nutrition to live active lives. That's more than the population of the United States, Mexico and Canada combined. Nearly half are children whose growth has been permanently stunted by severe malnutrition before age 5. In 2020 alone, a child died every 11 seconds from hunger's cascading effects.

Behind these grim figures lies a tapestry of lost human promise - artists who never found their voice, scholars who never charted new frontiers, builders who never raised a city from the dust. But their absence diminishes us all.

The bitter irony is that our planet produces enough calories to feed its inhabitants many times over. So why does hunger remain stubbornly entrenched in the 21st century?

The culprits are familiar - conflict, climate chaos, poverty, discrimination, and a global food system skewed to benefit the wealthy while trapping the poor in cycles of deprivation. In areas scourged by violence or climatic upheaval, food delivery is disrupted while arable farmland lies fallow. In many places, discrimination denies basic nutritional security to ethnic minorities, indigenous peoples, and women of all backgrounds.

And even where hunger doesn't stalk the land, poor diets rich in salt, sugar and low-nutrient filler exact a sweeping toll through obesity, diabetes, and other diet-related killers. At last count, one in three humans suffers from some form of malnutrition

But just as hunger's causes span the scope of human injustice and miscalculation, so too must the solutions harness the full ingenuity within our grasp. Vertical farming techniques, fortified crops, sustainable agriculture - these innovations can boost food production as climate impacts worsen. Infrastructure investment and enhanced storage can choke off spoilage in transit. Redirected subsidies can make highly-perishable yet nutritious foods affordable for all.

Above all, empowering women and promoting gender equality may be the most powerful lever available. Studies show that increases in women's income translate directly into improved child health and household food security.

In the end, the battle against hunger demands a holistic crusade encompassing economic access, technological innovation, infrastructure overhaul, and the unyielding determination to banish this ancient enemy from the face of the Earth.

Still, for all the urgency of the crisis, we must also guard against a vision of hunger's victims as passive, helpless wards. Even in the bleakest slum, people show resilience and resolve that humbles the fortunate. Ingenious urban gardens spring up in reclaimed lots. Households pool scant resources through intricate webs of sharing and barter. Ancient indigenous practices of cultivation and foraging endure.

These are not mere coping mechanisms, but portraits of indomitable human dignity - reminders that deprivation need not inevitably extinguish the soul.

So as we strive to build a well-nourished world, let us honor that dignity. Let us wield the tools of justice and science in service to those who hunger, working always in solidarity rather than condescending deliverance.

History's mightiest revolutions have often sprung from defiance of what was long deemed immutable. In that tradition, let our generation upend the age-old scourge of hunger once and for all. Our triumph over the impossible will echo through the ages yet to come.
