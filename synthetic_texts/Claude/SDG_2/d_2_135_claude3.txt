The Great Hunger Games: A Tragicomic Tale of Humanity's Poor Relationship with Food

By Mark Steel
Professor of Ironic Sustenance Studies, Satirica University

Allow me to regale you with a grotesque yet amusing story about the fundamental human activity of eating. Despite the mind-boggling advances of our species in conquering the mysteries of the universe and bending the forces of nature to our will, we still engage in a bizarre global drama regarding one of life's most basic requirements: satisfying our hunger pangs.  

The premise is almost too absurd to be believed. On one side of the saga, we have the eternal scourge of famine. Hundreds of millions of people don't have enough to eat, be it due to poverty, conflict, or that merciless trickster Mother Nature unleashing her droughts and plagues. Pictures of emaciated children with distended bellies have become a cliche backdrop on our television screens, their small bodies ravaged by acute malnutrition. 

And what is the world's response to this entirely preventable tragedy? Plenty of hand-wringing from politicians and celebrities. Billions upon billions of dollars poured into the bottomless pit of emergency food aid and agricultural development programs that are often mismanaged or simply ineffectual. It's almost as if the persistence of hunger is an accepted fact of life, like death and taxes.

But let's not ignore the other, more darkly comedic side of this hunger games tragi-farce. At the same time millions go hungry, we have an obesity crisis of epic proportions raging across the Western world. Too many of us are overfed, grossly overconsuming the limited resources of our small planet in a gluttonous binge of epic proportions. The leading causes of preventable death are now associated with overindulgence - heart disease, diabetes, some cancers.  

What manner of cosmic joke is this? The poor starve while the wealthy make themselves ill by compulsively stuffing their faces? You couldn't make this up if you were a brilliant satirist having an existential laughing fit at humanity's endless capacity for absurdity.

And consider the mind-bending fact that globally we already produce enough calories to feed the entire population, yet we fail to distribute this bounty in any semblance of an equitable, rational manner. In fact, a third of all food is simply wasted due to hoarding, poor infrastructure, and the prioritization of profits over human need.  

It gets even more farcical. The world's heaviest people tend to occupy the same nation-state boundaries as the most food-insecure populations. You can bear witness to the jarring spectacle of an overweight person accidentally stepping on an emaciated child while walking down the street – sometimes literally, though more often it is the figurative trampling of inequity.

Of course, I mustn't merely mock the hungry, as that would be too easy of a target. We in the global aristocracy of nutritional abundance have our own psychotic relationships with food. Fad diets and eating disorders, our bendiness to the whims of the diet-industrial complex, our sanctification and demonization of entire food groups based on flimsy evidence and moralistic quackery.

While the wealthy obsess over the minutiae of our First World food conundrums, children's bodies cease to function in slums and war zones due to lack of basic sustenance. A sobering contradiction that would shake most sane observers from their reverie of self-indulgence.

But I digress into somber reflection. Where were we in our journey through the comedic inanity of human hunger? Ah yes – our startlingly ineffective response as a global community.

Despite the hoopla surroundingagendas like the Sustainable Development Goals' Target 2 to "end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture," the bitter truth is that little substantial progress has been made in recent decades. Sure, the percentage of undernourished people has declined incrementally while obesity rates continue to spike globally, but the absolute numbers remain stubbornly high on both sides of the malnutrition divide.

It's almost as if hunger and obesity are inextricably, cosmically intertwined. A great Taoist conundrum wrapped in a paradoxical enigma of human desires and capitalistic impulses. Perhaps they are two sides of the same coin of our collective brokenness?

As a professor of ironic sustenance studies, I could prattle on about the systemic politico-economic roots of hunger and the philosophical tensions embedded in the modern food system. I may delve into the neo-Marxian analyses of the food regime and dissect the euphemistic discourse of "food insecurity." But I fear that would merely cement my campus reputation as a tone-deaf windbag entirely disconnected from the real and visceral suffering experienced by the hungry millions.

Instead, I'll leave you with this simple and only partially tongue-in-cheek observation: Until we treat food as a fundamental human right rather than a consumer commodity regulated by the profit motive, famine and obesity will continue to be locked in their dueling death dance across the planet.  

Our species has done remarkable things when collectively motivated to achieve a moral imperative: eradicating smallpox, putting humans on the moon, inventing sliced bread (far more revolutionary than we give it credit for). Perhaps one day we'll awaken to the clarion call of a world where no child's life is stilled by the agonizingly slow torture of hunger, where food is no longer a disposable source of pleasure for some and anguish for others.  

But for now, let's appreciate the mordant comedy baked into the very serious issue of malnutrition. If we couldn't laugh through the tears at humanity's endless capacity for self-defeating folly, we'd surely go mad from the relentless heartbreak of it all.
