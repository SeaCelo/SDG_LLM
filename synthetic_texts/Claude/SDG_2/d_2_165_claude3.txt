Here is a long academic article about SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), written in the satirical style of Carl Hiaasen:

The Parched Path to Stamping Out Hunger: A Satirical Saga of Shriveled Crops and Corporate Cronies

By Carl Hiaasen, The Disgruntled Chair of Arid Agriculture at the University of Baked Bean Studies

Let's get skewered right off the bat - humanity's quest to achieve Zero Hunger is about as likely as Florida electing a governor who isn't in the backpocket of Big Sugar. Sure, the United Nations can slap a catchy label like "Sustainable Development Goal 2" on the bumper sticker, but that donkey cart left the station long ago with a trailer full of rotting melons.

Just look around at the scorched, cracked earth everywhere you turn these days. The climate's going haywire like an unplugged oscillating sprinkler on the surface of the Sun. Drought zones are spreading like an outbreak of whiskery armpit fungus on Baywatch extras. And exactly which mad scientist dreamed up the bright idea of planting all our food in places quickly morphing into the parched, gusty equivalent of Mrs. Caliente's enchilada platter after a night of tequila shots?

Thanks to some crafty lobbying from the usual suspects (cough, Monsanto, cough), those sustainable cornfields of lush, seed-kerneled dreams are withering into desiccated stalks brittle enough to star in a remake of The Blair Witch Project. And we're supposed to pinky-swear that somehow this starved planet will magically grow enough quinoa to feed the 9 billion malnourished mouths panting on the horizon?

That's quite a tall glass of cactus juice our leaders are trying to force down our drought-stricken gullets. Of course, the wheeled cockroaches at Enviropocalypse, Inc. aren't losing any sleep - their cisterns are brimming with tanker loads of desalinated caviar baths while the small folks get by gargling with their own recycled spit.

The real punch line, though, is that Zero Hunger could be as simple as skipping a cheeseburger every few days and redirecting those bloated Big Mac subsidies into fertilizers that don't require an extraction team and a six-figure bribe to a OPEC henchman. But let's be honest - when it comes to doing the right thing, most of us will bite into that salty innard-bomb every damn time. We'll keep plowing our range-burned flatulence into the atmosphere until Earth is as blistered and barren as a dipsomaniac's liver. 

Then we can all drown our sorrows by vaping the strained pulp while a svelte Jared Leto puffs on a diamond-encrusted hookahdini in an Entourage reboot. Bone app-the-tit, desiccated dingbats! The planet's snack bowl has been upended and licked clean of all its chocolate-covered ants. Hunger, consider yourself extinct...along with every other organic life form still possessing the audacity to beg for sustenance.
