Here is a draft academic article on SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) from the perspective of Clarence Page:

Ending Hunger in Our Time: A Moral and Economic Imperative

The persistence of widespread hunger in the 21st century is a stain on our collective conscience and an impediment to human progress. Despite unprecedented global wealth and agricultural advances, hundreds of millions still suffer from malnutrition and food insecurity. This paradox stems from systemic injustices, conflicts, climate disruptions, and inefficient food systems that squander resources and deprive the neediest among us. Tackling hunger is not only a moral duty, but an economic necessity to unlock human potential across the globe.

Undernutrition during the critical first years of life can permanently stunt physical and cognitive development, eroding earnings potential by a staggering 10 percent. Food insecurity forces difficult trade-offs between nutrition and other essentials like healthcare or education. The resulting poverty trap ensnares families for generations, perpetuating cycles of deprivation. Ending hunger could add $330 billion annually to national incomes and spur economic dynamism.

Agriculture, the economic backbone for most developing nations, remains hobbled by low productivity stemming from inadequate infrastructure, inputs, financing, and climate resilience. Women disproportionately shoulder these burdens, while lacking equitable access to resources. Small-scale farmers who grow one-third of the world's food battle exploitative conditions and food waste leakages. Investment shortfalls deprive agricultural research and development of innovations that could revolutionize yields sustainably.

Distressingly, one-third of all food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted due to poor storage, logistics, market access, overproduction, and consumer behavior. In affluent nations, unconscionable amounts of edible food end up in landfills while obesity epidemics ravage public health. Such contradictions highlight the need to realign systemically wasteful practices with ethical norms of equitable distribution and environmental stewardship.

Climate change exacerbates hunger through increased droughts, saltwater inundation of arable land, biodiversity losses, and decimated fisheries. The poor majority who depend on agriculture and coastal resources for sustenance grow more vulnerable to famine with each compounded shock. Displaced by violence or ecological devastation, record numbers face protracted limbo in squalid refugee camps.

Solutions abound if we match investments to needs. Upgrading crop storage, transport and market access could slash post-harvest losses. Technological advances like drought-resistant seeds, low-tillage farming and precision agriculture could boost productivity while conserving resources. Repairing broken food value chains and incentivizing sustainable behaviors among producers and consumers alike would enhance efficiency. Empowering women with equal rights and resources unleashes their potential to eradicate hunger. Emergency relief and resiliency assistance is vital for shielding vulnerable communities from the worst impacts of climate disruptions, conflicts and economic shocks.

No humanitarian crisis exemplifies our collective failure to act as the horrific famine gripping Yemen, a man-made catastrophe fueled by military interventions and deliberate economic strangulation of civilians. Ending this senseless suffering should impel our moral conscience into action to avert similarly disastrous famines that loom across the Sahel and elsewhere.  

Complex challenges require multifaceted strategies, but one overarching principle is clear: ensuring consistent access to affordable, nutritious food must be an utmost priority if we hope to realize the full transformative potential of humanizing development. Hunger anywhere is an injustice to our shared humanity everywhere. I dare political leaders, captains of industry, civil society and global citizens to join in finally expunging this scourge from the face of the Earth during our lifetimes. Food and dignity for all is both an attainable and indispensable cornerstone of true, sustainable human progress.
