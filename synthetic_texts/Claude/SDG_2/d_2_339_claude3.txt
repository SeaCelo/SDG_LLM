Camões Institute's Role in Achieving SDG 2: Eradicating Hunger

As the entity responsible for Portuguese cooperation policy, the Camões Institute for Cooperation and Language has closely monitored global efforts to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2): Eradicate Hunger. Despite significant progress in some regions, food insecurity remains an urgent challenge, exacerbated by factors such as conflicts, climate change, and economic shocks.

The multidimensional approach of SDG 2 is essential to address this complex challenge. Promoting sustainable and resilient food systems is a central pillar of this agenda. This entails adopting sustainable agricultural practices, such as agroecology and conservation agriculture, which minimize environmental impact and enhance long-term productivity. Additionally, investing in rural infrastructure, such as efficient irrigation systems and resilient value chains, is crucial to improving small-scale farmers' access to markets.

Nutrition is another critical component of SDG 2. Despite progress in reducing child malnutrition, maternal undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies remain substantial concerns. Multisectoral approaches involving health, agriculture, and education are essential to improve dietary diversity and promote healthy nutritional habits. Initiatives such as crop biofortification and micronutrient supplementation play a vital role in this effort.

Moreover, addressing the root causes of food insecurity, such as poverty, conflicts, and gender inequalities, is imperative. Economic empowerment of rural women, through access to land, credit, and agricultural technologies, is fundamental to improving families' food and nutritional security. Simultaneously, strengthening social protection mechanisms and income transfer programs is necessary to ensure equitable food access and mitigate the impacts of food crises.

However, efforts to achieve SDG 2 face significant challenges. Climate change is exerting increasing pressure on food systems, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. Extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods, threaten agricultural production and food security. Consequently, investing in climate-resilient agricultural practices, such as soil and water conservation, and early warning systems is crucial to mitigate the impacts of climate change.

Additionally, armed conflicts and humanitarian crises continue to pose significant obstacles to progress on SDG 2. Conflicts often lead to the destruction of agricultural infrastructure, disruption of food supply chains, and displacement of populations. Addressing these crises requires concerted efforts in peacekeeping, reconstruction, and reintegration, as well as the provision of emergency food assistance.

In summary, achieving SDG 2 requires a holistic and integrated approach, encompassing sustainable food production, nutrition, climate resilience, women’s empowerment, and conflict mitigation. Only through coordinated global efforts involving governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector can we truly eradicate hunger and food insecurity in all its forms.
