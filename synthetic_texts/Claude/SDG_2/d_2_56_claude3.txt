Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), written from the perspective of Brendan O'Neill:

The Utopian Folly of SDG #2 and the War on Hunger
By Brendan O'Neill

Despite what pearl-clutching environmentalists would have you believe, the struggle to "end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture" – the lofty aim of the UN's Sustainable Development Goal #2 – is both an impossibly ambitious reach and an unwanted infringement on personal freedom and economic liberty. This top-down, statist dystopia of a scheme would institute draconian measures to regulate what we eat, all in service of an eco-puritanical agenda hellbent on putting Mother Nature before humans.

At its core, SDG #2 peddles the corrosive idea that mankind's primacy over the natural world is flawed, unethical even. It posits that activities designed to "satisfy the needs of present and future generations" through industrial agriculture, free trade of foodstuffs, and plentiful consumption are inherently immoral if they fail to align with arbitrary "environmental limits." This is the misanthropic ideology of an elite clerisy deathly afraid that the grubby masses, left to their own devices and appetites, will ransack and ruin the planet.

The "solution" peddled by SDG #2 zealots is to override personal choice through byzantine regimes of rules, regulations and State interventions – controlling food prices, taxing "unhealthy" eating habits, incentivizing absurd "plant-based" diets, limiting fertilizer use, and generally treating humankind like mindless children incapable of responsible decision-making. They couch this dystopian vision in the soft tonguing of "sustainable intensification" and "resilient practices," but the reality is an intrusive, coercive blueprint for living designed to dramatically curb individual freedoms.

And for what intended outcome exactly? Ending global hunger is a cosmically utopian goal rendered practically infeasible by population growth, distribution challenges, economic bottlenecks and the brute geographic fact that certain parts of the world suffer endemic food scarcity. Forcing compliant populations to eat their government-approved rations of lentils and quinoa won't magically make food appear in the desert or stave off famine in war zones. Hunger persists for complex geopolitical reasons entirely beyond the scope of SDG bureaucratic handwaving.

It is also predicated on an ahistorical premise that humanity faces widespread hunger, when the opposite is true. Across the 20th century, mass starvation plunged dramatically due to modernized agricultural practices, global trade networks, and innovative technologies like synthetic fertilizers and genetically engineered crops. Even famine "hot spots" like Ethiopia and Somalia are exponentially better fed today than previous eras. The real crisis is found in the scaremongering rhetoric of wealthy Western activists who have never truly experienced hunger or need.

Rather than tackle authentic challenges like localised poverty, failed governance, and regional conflicts that contribute to food scarcity, SDG #2 is instead a cosmetic vanity project – a platform for virtue-signalling "humanitarians" to wag their fingers at the developing world while enjoying their Sunday farmers' market kale Caesar back home. If these planet-cuddlers truly cared about eradicating hunger, they would agitate for sweeping economic liberalization, the dismantling of protectionist policies favoring inefficient Western farmers, and the global proliferation of biotechnology and industrial agriculture. Instead, they promote ruinous initiatives that strangle the very innovations best poised to feed the world's neediest.

Ultimately, SDG #2 is a mirage of pseudo-benevolence – the cynical weaponization of a noble cause to smuggle in an ideology that views humanity itself as a blight to be corrected, managed, restricted. It prioritizes the environment over people. It is a shibboleth for the self-loathing misanthropy of the modern West, and an imperialist imposition of elite values upon the impoverished masses. The struggle against hunger demands a bold reckoning with harsh realities – not the blinkered imposition of biodegradable shackles.
