Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger), written from the perspective of Janet Albrechtsen:

The Hollow Crusade Against Hunger: Unmasking the Agenda Behind SDG 2

By Janet Albrechtsen, Distinguished Fellow at the Institute of Public Affairs  

As we examine the United Nations' much-vaunted Sustainable Development Goal 2 – to "end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture" – we must peel back the layers of lofty rhetoric and examine the unspoken agenda lurking beneath. 

On the surface, the concept of eliminating hunger worldwide appears an eminently worthwhile endeavor. None of us wish to see impoverished children suffering from malnutrition or famine devastating populations. However, a deeper analysis reveals that SDG 2 is little more than a Trojan horse – a vehicle for ushering in radical policies antithetical to free market economics and unbridled by national sovereignty.

At its core, SDG 2 enshrines the doctrine of food security, which aims to guarantee all people access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food at all times. This top-down, command-and-control approach grants governing bodies sweeping powers to dictate what crops are grown, how they are distributed, and what ends up on our plates. In the zealous pursuit of caloric quotas, consumer preferences and dietary choice become sacrificed at the altar of bureaucratic mandate.

Moreover, SDG 2 explicitly endorses "sustainable agriculture" – code for industrial-scale farming practices that appease eco-evangelists while impoverishing rural communities. Under this misguided philosophy, traditional methods honed over centuries are condemned as archaic and inefficient. Generations of agricultural wisdom are discarded in favor of restrictive regimes that impede innovation, stifle productivity, and erode economic self-determination.

This creeping green agenda extends far beyond the farm, with SDG 2 advocating for the "sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources" – a rallying cry for those seeking to handcuff industry with draconian environmental regulations. In the name of combating hunger, we are subjected to intrusive policies that ration water, limit energy production, and place hard limits on extraction, processing and manufacturing.  

Underpinning SDG 2 is the same flawed collectivist ideology that has crippled so many ill-fated development efforts of the past. By subordinating the rights of the individual, displacing market forces, and consolidating control under centralized planners, we witness the seeds of famine being sown under the auspices of fighting hunger.  

We need look no further than the Soviet Union's catastrophic experiments with agriculture for a haunting preview of what may transpire. From Stalin's ruinous forced collectivization to Mao's calamitous Great Leap Forward, history has demonstrated time and again the dire consequences of supplanting private enterprise with command agriculture.

Nor must we overlook how wielding the hunger crisis serves the ideological ends of economic redistribution. SDG 2 calls not merely for addressing scarcity, but for "correcting and preventing trade restrictions and distortions in world agricultural markets." This blatant protectionist signaling reveals the implicit goal of undermining free trade, suppressing competition, and instituting a rebalancing of global market shares.

At its core, SDG 2 constitutes a stalking horse for larger power-brokers to impose their technocratic vision upon populations, strip away economic liberties, and consolidate control over the planet's food systems and productive capacities. This treacherous Trojan horse must be recognized, resisted, and rejected outright. Only then can we preserve our fundamental freedoms while empowering the ingenuity and market forces truly capable of eliminating hunger worldwide.
