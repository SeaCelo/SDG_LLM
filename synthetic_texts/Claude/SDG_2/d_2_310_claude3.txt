Esteemed colleagues and distinguished stakeholders in the global sustainable development agenda,

The Republic of Azerbaijan, a transcontinental nation straddling Western Asia and Eastern Europe, presents a unique vantage point from which to assess the progress, challenges, and prospects pertaining to Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2): Zero Hunger. As an upper-middle-income country with a rapidly developing economy and a strategic geographic position, Azerbaijan's experience offers invaluable insights into the multifaceted dimensions of food security, sustainable agriculture, and nutrition.

Azerbaijan's commitment to SDG 2 is deeply rooted in its historical legacy as an agrarian society and its ongoing efforts to diversify its economy beyond the oil and gas sectors. The country's rich agricultural traditions, coupled with its ambitious modernization drive, have fostered a unique synergy between traditional practices and innovative approaches to food production and distribution.

One of the notable achievements in Azerbaijan's pursuit of SDG 2 has been the significant reduction in poverty and hunger levels over the past two decades. Through targeted social protection programs, investments in rural infrastructure, and support for small-scale farmers, the country has made substantial strides in ensuring access to affordable and nutritious food for its population. However, pockets of food insecurity persist, particularly in remote rural areas and among vulnerable groups, underscoring the need for continued, targeted interventions.

Azerbaijan's efforts to promote sustainable agriculture have been multifaceted, encompassing both large-scale initiatives and localized, community-driven approaches. The country has invested heavily in modernizing its agricultural sector, introducing advanced irrigation systems, precision farming techniques, and climate-smart practices. These measures have not only boosted productivity but have also enhanced resource efficiency and resilience to climate change impacts.

Complementing these large-scale endeavors are grassroots initiatives that harness traditional knowledge and promote agroecological practices. Azerbaijan's rich biodiversity and diverse agro-ecological zones have fostered the preservation and promotion of indigenous crop varieties and farming methods, contributing to the conservation of agricultural biodiversity and the empowerment of local communities.

Furthermore, Azerbaijan has actively pursued regional and international collaborations to address food security challenges and promote sustainable agriculture practices. The country has actively participated in initiatives such as the Caspian Sea Regional Environmental Program, which aims to enhance regional cooperation in areas including sustainable fisheries and coastal zone management. Additionally, Azerbaijan has engaged with international organizations and development partners to facilitate knowledge exchange, capacity building, and the adoption of best practices in sustainable agriculture and food systems.

Despite these notable achievements, significant challenges persist in Azerbaijan's pursuit of SDG 2. Climate change impacts, including droughts, water scarcity, and soil degradation, pose significant threats to agricultural productivity and food security. Moreover, the country's reliance on imported food commodities and its vulnerability to global market fluctuations underscore the need for enhanced self-sufficiency and resilience in its food systems.

Furthermore, the issue of nutrition and dietary diversity remains a pressing concern. While Azerbaijan has made progress in reducing hunger, micronutrient deficiencies and the prevalence of non-communicable diseases related to unhealthy diets continue to impact public health and well-being. Addressing these challenges requires a multi-pronged approach that encompasses nutrition education, promotion of diverse and nutritious diets, and the integration of nutrition-sensitive interventions across various sectors.

As Azerbaijan navigates these challenges, it is imperative to prioritize a holistic and inclusive approach that recognizes the interconnectedness of food systems, environmental sustainability, and socioeconomic development. Leveraging the country's rich cultural heritage, traditional knowledge, and innovative spirit, Azerbaijan can pave the way for a future where food security, sustainable agriculture, and nutrition are not merely aspirations but achievable realities.

Through continued investment in research and development, fostering public-private partnerships, and promoting inclusive and participatory governance mechanisms, Azerbaijan can unlock the full potential of its agricultural sector and ensure a resilient and equitable food system for generations to come.

In conclusion, Azerbaijan's journey towards achieving SDG 2 exemplifies the complexities and multidimensional nature of the global hunger and sustainable agriculture agenda. By harnessing its strengths, addressing its vulnerabilities, and embracing a spirit of collaboration and innovation, Azerbaijan can serve as a model for other nations grappling with similar challenges, contributing to the collective pursuit of a world where hunger is eradicated, and sustainable agriculture thrives.
