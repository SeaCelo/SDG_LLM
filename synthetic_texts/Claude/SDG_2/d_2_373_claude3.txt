The International Red Cross recognizes the critical importance of Sustainable Development Goal 2 – Zero Hunger – in addressing the global crisis of food insecurity and malnutrition. Despite the concerted efforts of various stakeholders, the world remains far from achieving this ambitious target, with the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbating existing vulnerabilities and reversing hard-won gains.

Our organization's frontline operations across numerous conflict zones and humanitarian emergencies have provided us with a sobering perspective on the multifaceted challenges that impede progress towards SDG 2. Protracted armed conflicts, environmental degradation, climate change, and economic instability have perpetuated a vicious cycle of food shortages, malnutrition, and poverty, particularly in fragile and displaced communities.

In Yemen, for instance, the ongoing conflict has precipitated one of the world's most severe hunger crises, with nearly half of the population facing acute food insecurity. The deliberate targeting of civilian infrastructure, including farms, markets, and water systems, has crippled the country's agricultural capacity and disrupted vital supply chains. Children in Yemen are bearing the brunt of this crisis, with over two million suffering from acute malnutrition, which can lead to lifelong developmental impairments and heightened mortality rates.

Similarly, in the Sahel region of Africa, climate change-induced droughts, land degradation, and resource scarcity have exacerbated food insecurity and fueled intercommunal conflicts over dwindling resources. Pastoralist communities, whose livelihoods depend on seasonal migrations and access to grazing lands, have been disproportionately affected, leading to widespread displacement and further straining fragile food systems.

Across these contexts, the International Red Cross has implemented a multipronged approach to address the root causes of hunger and malnutrition. Our emergency relief efforts prioritize the immediate provision of food aid, therapeutic feeding programs, and access to safe water and sanitation facilities. Simultaneously, we collaborate with local communities to promote sustainable agricultural practices, such as drought-resistant crops, water harvesting techniques, and smallholder farmer training programs.

However, we recognize that these interventions alone are insufficient to achieve SDG 2. Sustainable progress requires a comprehensive and coordinated global effort to address the underlying drivers of food insecurity, including conflict resolution, climate change mitigation, and inclusive economic development.

To this end, the International Red Cross advocates for enhanced international cooperation and multilateral action. We call for increased investment in conflict prevention and peacebuilding initiatives, as well as robust climate adaptation measures that prioritize the resilience of vulnerable communities and their food systems. Moreover, we emphasize the need for inclusive and equitable economic policies that promote sustainable agricultural practices, support smallholder farmers, and ensure access to affordable and nutritious food for all.

Crucially, our efforts are guided by the principle of localization, recognizing that sustainable solutions must be rooted in local knowledge, traditions, and contexts. We prioritize community empowerment and capacity-building, ensuring that our interventions are culturally appropriate, environmentally sustainable, and driven by the needs and aspirations of the people we serve.

In conclusion, the path towards achieving SDG 2 is arduous, but our collective commitment and unwavering determination remain steadfast. By addressing the multifaceted drivers of food insecurity, promoting sustainable agricultural practices, and fostering inclusive and equitable development, we can transform the global food system and ensure that no one is left behind.
