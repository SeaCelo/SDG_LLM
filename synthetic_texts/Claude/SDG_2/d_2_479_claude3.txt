Hunger Persists in a World of Plenty: The Struggle to Achieve SDG 2
By Jennifer Abazi, Global Development Correspondent

NAIROBI, Kenya — In the informal settlement of Mathare, a dense labyrinth of tin-roofed shacks sprawling across the valley between the wealthy enclaves of Nairobi, children play amid the open gutters that line the winding pathways. Many of these children know hunger intimately. Their distended bellies betray the devastating impacts of malnutrition that leave 1 in 4 Kenyan children stunted. 

This is the cruel paradox at the heart of the fight against hunger and malnutrition. Despite living in a world that produces more than enough food to feed the global population, an estimated 828 million people still suffered from undernourishment in 2021, according to the latest UN figures. After decades of steady progress, the number has been increasing in recent years, exacerbated by conflict, climate shocks, and the lingering economic impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic.

"The fundamental injustice is that hunger exists at all in a world of abundance," said David Beasley, Executive Director of the World Food Programme. "There is enough food on this planet to feed every person on Earth, and then some. What we face is more a crisis of distribution and access than outright scarcity."  

Yet solving that crisis has proved to be an immense challenge. The UN's Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) calls for an end to hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030. But with just seven years remaining, that target looks increasingly out of reach as the number of undernourished people around the world has continued inching upwards.

"The world is moving in the wrong direction when it comes to SDG 2," said Arif Husain, Chief Economist at the World Food Programme. "The sheer scale and complexity of the challenge means that all stakeholders — governments, aid agencies, civil society, and the private sector — need to radically rethink and redouble their efforts."

At the heart of that rethink is the need to tackle the systemic drivers of hunger and malnutrition that go far beyond just producing more food. Conflict has long been recognized as a leading cause of food insecurity, with warzones like Yemen, Afghanistan, and the Tigray region of Ethiopia facing acute hunger emergencies. But climate change is an increasingly potent threat multiplier, with rising temperatures, shifting rainfall patterns, and extreme weather events disrupting agricultural production across wide swaths of the developing world.

The fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine has further destabilized global food systems, cutting off supplies of grain and fertilizer from two of the world's leading exporters. That has fueled spikes in food and fertilizer prices, pushing millions more into hunger while constraining humanitarian relief efforts.

"The ripple effects of this conflict on food security globally have been seismic," said Beasley. "We're seeing soaring hunger rates everywhere from East Africa to Central America as the costs of staple foods have skyrocketed out of reach for tens of millions."

In Somalia, over 7 million people are now facing acute hunger as the country endures its worst drought in four decades. The arid nation sources nearly all of its wheat supplies from Russia and Ukraine. As those imports dried up after the invasion, food prices soared, converging with the drought to push many rural pastoralist communities to the brink of famine.

But hunger and malnutrition extend well beyond the high-profile crises sparked by war and climate shocks. Childhood stunting and micronutrient deficiencies remain pervasive across much of the developing world, the result of sustained nutritional deprivation from conception through those critical first years of life.

"Physical and cognitive stunting during that 1,000-day window sets children on a diminished life trajectory in terms of health and economic prospects," said Saskia Osendarp, Executive Director of the Micronutrient Forum. "It becomes very difficult to compensate for that later in life."

This more insidious form of hunger deprives societies of human potential on a massive scale. According to World Bank estimates, malnutrition could cost the global economy up to $3.5 trillion annually in lost productivity and healthcare costs. That's a staggering sum that underscores how achieving SDG 2 is both a moral and economic imperative.

Aid agencies and initiatives like the World Food Programme, UNICEF, and Nutrition International have been at the vanguard of efforts to tackle malnutrition through targeted interventions like food assistance, vitamin supplementation, and therapeutic feeding programs. But many experts argue that such "nutrition-specific" interventions need to be complemented by "nutrition-sensitive" development approaches aimed at sustainably boosting dietary quality and diversity.

"Handouts alone are not enough to solve hunger and malnutrition in the long run," said Shenggen Fan, Chair Professor at the College of Economics and Management at China Agricultural University. "We need a paradigm shift to transform our entire food systems to make them more efficient, inclusive, sustainable, and nutrition-driven."

That means reorienting agricultural policies and investments toward more nutrient-dense foods like fruits, vegetables, legumes, and livestock products instead of just maximizing calorie production from staple commodity crops. It calls for curbing water-intensive crops in drought-prone areas, and promoting climate-resilient indigenous varieties. It necessitates cutting food loss and waste while improving value chains and market access so that nutritious foods can make it from farm to fork.  

"For too long, we designed our agricultural systems for the hungry, not the undernourished," said Joao Campos, Senior Director for Food System Delivery at the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA). "Now we need nutrition to be the central driver across the entire food value chain."

Promisingly, innovative new approaches are emerging on multiple fronts. Cutting-edge tools like remote sensing and machine learning are helping target humanitarian relief with greater precision. New bio-fortified crops enriched with essential micronutrients are being developed through conventional breeding and biotechnology. Mobile money platforms and e-commerce solutions are expanding market access for smallholder farmers.  

Meanwhile, there is increasing focus on empowering women as a force-multiplier for nutrition outcomes, since evidence shows that additional income controlled by women is disproportionately invested back into their families' nutrition. Youth engagement and grassroots movements like the "Food Systems Heroes" campaign are mobilizing next-generation changemakers. And multistakeholder partnerships —exemplified by pooled financing vehicles like The Power of Nutrition — are catalyzing impacts at greater scale.  

Yet for all these promising developments, fundamental constraints around governance, political will, and resources remain formidable obstacles. Despite mounting malnutrition burdens that extract an immense economic toll, global investment in nutrition remains woefully inadequate at just over $3.9 billion annually based on 2015 figures. Contrast that with the estimated $3.5 trillion in annual costs from malnutrition cited above.  

"We're chronically underfunding upstream preventative actions to address malnutrition," said Gerda Verburg, Coordinator of the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) Movement that supports national nutrition plans. "We end up paying exponentially more on the back end to pick up the pieces after human potential has already been squandered."  

Inadequate governance and accountability mechanisms further hamstring progress. Too often, line ministries responsible for issues like agriculture, health, water, and social protection operate in siloes. Nutrition falls through the cracks amid diffuse mandates and lack of coordinated, multisectoral strategies.   

Perhaps the most daunting hurdle is the absence of sustained political commitment and leadership. For all the economic arguments about investing in nutrition upfront, the issue persistently falls low on the totem pole amid myriad competing priorities and interests. Poverty, disease, education, energy access, and economic growth crowd out nutrition on domestic agendas. On the global stage, the attention and funding flowing to headline-grabbing crises like COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine inevitably diminish the oxygen and resources available to address protracted challenges like hunger.

Small wonder then that 10 years after world leaders committed to the SDGs, including the specific target of Zero Hunger by 2030, the world remains far off track. While remarkable progress was achieved in reducing undernourishment over the previous two decades, the costly backsliding during the 2010s has erased many of those hard-fought gains.

"We're standing at a crossroads," said Husain of the World Food Programme. "We can continue on the current trajectory of firefighting one crisis after another and resigning ourselves to perpetual hunger and malnutrition. Or we can radically transform our approach and prioritize the sustained, preventative investments and holistic policies required to truly solve this challenge once and for all."

As he spoke, a boy walked past clutching a small bundle of scavenged firewood, his protruding ribs visible through his threadbare shirt. If the current trends hold, he and millions of other children like him around the world may live their entire lives in the grip of hunger's enduring grasp.

Whether in the shanty towns of Nairobi or the drought-ravaged pasturelands of Somalia, the human toll exacted by this ancient scourge weighs as heavily as ever on the world's collective conscience. Nearly a decade since they were enshrined, the Sustainable Development Goals offer an ambitious vision for a more just, equitable, and sustainable future. What remains is mustering the will and resolve to see that vision realized.
For failing to do so would represent one of the greatest indictments of our shared moral fiber. There is enough for everyone's need, the saying goes, but not enough for everyone's greed. The path forward is clear. Whether humanity will finally choose to follow through is the crucial question that still hangs in the balance.
