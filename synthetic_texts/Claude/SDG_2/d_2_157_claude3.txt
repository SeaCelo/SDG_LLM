Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger), written from the perspective of Tina Dupuy:

Achieving Zero Hunger: A Paradox of Abundance and Deprivation in the Modern World
By Tina Dupuy

The second of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals is a cruel paradox: the world currently produces enough food to nourish every single person on the planet, yet hundreds of millions still go hungry each day. This unsettling contrast between abundance and deprivation is a damning indictment of our global priorities and systems. How can we allow such egregious inequities to persist in an era of unprecedented agricultural productivity and technological sophistication?

The reasons for this paradox are multifaceted, intertwined with issues of poverty, conflict, climate change, and systemic injustices that have become deeply entrenched over centuries of human civilization. In many impoverished regions, lack of access to nutritious food sources is compounded by environmental degradation, poor infrastructure, political instability, and ongoing cycles of violence that disrupt agricultural activities and supply chains.  

Even in wealthy nations with ample food supplies, disturbing levels of hunger and food insecurity persist, illustrating how this crisis transcends geographical boundaries. Rising wealth disparities, inadequate social safety nets, and short-sighted policies that prioritize corporate profits over human welfare all contribute to this needless deprivation amidst plenty.

Perhaps most perversely, a significant portion of food waste – estimated at over one billion tons annually – occurs due to logistical inefficiencies, arbitrary cosmetic standards, and consumer complacency in overdeveloped economies. This blatant squandering represents a moral failing on a civilizational scale, when juxtaposed against the heartrending images of famine and childhood malnutrition that plague humanity's collective conscience.

Tackling this multidimensional challenge demands a comprehensive overhaul of our global food systems, rooted in principles of sustainability, equity and human rights. Increased investment in regenerative agricultural practices, resilient infrastructure, and localized production models can enhance food security while mitigating environmental degradation. Combating hunger also necessitates confronting systemic injustices through robust social protection programs, equitable resource distribution, and economic empowerment of marginalized communities.

Innovative technologies like precision agriculture, vertical farming, and biofortification show promise in boosting yields and nutritional value. However, these advances must be implemented ethically and democratically, without entrenching corporate monopolies or displacing small-scale farmers. Agroecology and indigenous knowledge systems offer underutilized pathways towards sustainable intensification that harmonizes food production with ecological preservation.

Ultimately, the fight against hunger is inextricably linked to the broader pursuit of social justice, human rights, and a economic paradigm shift that prioritizes collective wellbeing over narrow self-interests. As long as we tolerate vast socioeconomic inequalities and exploitative market dynamics, the scourge of hunger will persist as a visceral manifestation of our moral shortcomings as a global society.

Achieving Zero Hunger requires dismantling the systemic barriers, power imbalances and flawed ideologies that have perpetuated deprivation amidst plenty for far too long. It demands a radical reconceptualization of how we produce, distribute and VALUE food as the fundamental source of human sustenance. Only through such a revolutionary transformation can we resolve the paradox that defines the greatest challenge to our collective conscience in the 21st century.
