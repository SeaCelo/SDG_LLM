Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger), drafted as if written by Rosa Brooks:

"The bitter paradox that we live in a world where obesity levels are soaring in wealthy nations even as malnutrition remains endemic across vast swaths of the planet is emblematic of the grotesque injustices that pervade our global food systems. Sustainable Development Goal 2 - to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture - cuts to the core of some of humanity's most fundamental needs and challenges. It demands that we confront not just the obvious humanitarian tragedy of persistent hunger and famine, but the deeper systemic pathologies that create fertile ground for conflict, instability, and human rights violations worldwide. 

The correlations between food insecurity, poverty, and violence are stark and undeniable. In failed states and regions plagued by civil strife, food insecurity is both a consequence and a driver of turmoil. Droughts, crop failures, and disruptions to supply chains serve as threat multipliers, eroding fragile societal resilience. Desperate populations become potential recruits for extremist and rebel groups able to leverage their misery. In countries like Yemen and South Sudan, parties to conflicts have systematically used starvation as a tactic of war.

But food insecurity doesn't just inflame violence abroad; it also acts as an incubator for the populist authoritarianism that has infected many democracies from within. When citizens lack assured access to affordable, nutritious food, they become susceptible to demagogic narratives that scapegoat ethnic minorities, refugees, and outsiders. We've seen this script play out from Myanmar to Hungary, exploiting insecurity to fuel cycles of oppression and discrimination.

The challenges underlying SDG 2 are also fundamentally challenges of sustainability – and of structural inequalities rooted in centuries of colonial exploitation, discrimination, and environmental degradation. The industrialized food production that averted Malthusian famines has depleted soils and aquifers and generated catastrophic levels of pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. The nutrition transitions that brought processed, energy-dense foods to many parts of the developing world have triggered dual burdens of obesity and malnutrition. And the commodification of agriculture and disruption of traditional food ways has eroded food sovereignty and cultural resilience for indigenous communities.

True food security requires a radical rethinking of our agricultural models and value chains. We must invest in decentralized, regionalized food systems based on regenerative practices, seed diversity, rainwater harvesting, and polycultures optimized for ecological and economic resilience. This will not only promote environmental sustainability but help insulate vulnerable communities from shocks and revitalize traditional foodways and food cultures.

Hunger is not, at its core, a productivity problem. We already produce more than enough food to feed everyone on the planet. It is a problem of distribution, access, and justice – one that manifests vividly at every link in our global food supply chains, which are rife with labor exploitation, market concentration, and unequal power dynamics reinforcing generational cycles of malnutrition and poverty.

Achieving SDG 2 demands a holistic policy and advocacy agenda aimed at promoting ecological sustainability, community food sovereignty, anti-poverty programs, land reform, worker's rights across food supply chains, greater food regulations and transparency, gender equity, and accountability for hunger as a potential crime against humanity.  Just as food insecurity enables violence, ensuring food security is both a moral imperative and a crucial investment in conflict prevention, climate resilience, economic development, and human rights protection worldwide.

We must approach SDG 2 with a nuanced understanding of the intersecting power structures, social determinants, and discriminatory systems that produce hunger and malnutrition at every level – from wasted food in affluent neighborhoods to the devastation wrought by famine in forgotten war zones. It is time to transcend the false dichotomies– hunger vs. obesity, malnutrition vs. overpopulation, scarcity vs. distribution – that reproduce unjust narratives. Access to affordable, nutritious food is a fundamental human right. Food security is freedom."
