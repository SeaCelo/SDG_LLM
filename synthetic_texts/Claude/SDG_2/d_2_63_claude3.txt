Here is a draft academic article about SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) as if written by Gwynne Dyer:

Ending Hunger in an Age of Environmental Crisis and Geopolitical Turmoil
By Gwynne Dyer

The goal of "zero hunger" has taken on heightened urgency in our era of cascading environmental emergencies and escalating geopolitical tensions. As the destabilizing forces of climate change, ecosystem degradation, resource scarcity, and great power conflicts converge, the world's poorest and most vulnerable populations find themselves on the precipice of unprecedented food insecurity. Tackling hunger is no longer just a moral imperative – it is an existential necessity that will shape the trajectory of human civilization itself.

To understand the staggering scale of the challenge, we need only examine the latest grim statistics. After decades of steady progress, the number of undernourished people began rising sharply in 2015, propelled by the unholy trinity of conflict, climate extremes, and economic shocks. By 2021, a staggering 828 million people – nearly one in ten humans – suffered from hunger, with the situation expected to worsen due to the reverberating impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the ever-intensifying climate crisis.

Against this grim backdrop, consider the chilling ramifications of a potential multi-breadbasket failure – an environmentally-driven catastrophe affecting multiple major food-producing regions simultaneously. Historically unprecedented but increasingly plausible, such an event could precipitate famines of biblical proportions, unleashing seizmic geopolitical instability as nations prioritize domestic food supplies over exports. With hunger comes societal unraveling, mass migration, radicalization, and conflict over dwindling resources – a vicious cycle that only exacerbates the root causes.

This apocalyptic scenario seems fanciful until one begins connecting the ominous data points. The Middle East and North Africa are facing an existential threat of drought so severe that internal agriculture may cease within decades. Southern Europe is already experiencing desertification, water scarcity so extreme that even wealthy Spain is considering desalination infrastructure rivaling Saudi Arabia's. In the Indo-Gangetic plains – the breadbasket of 1.7 billion South Asians – rivers fed by Himalayan glaciers are drying up while life-giving aquifers deplete at unsustainable rates. 

Across every inhabited continent, the very environmental foundations of food security are being undermined by human-induced climate change. Heat waves, droughts, floods, pests – these multiplying threats are steadily degrading arable lands and yield potentials. Meanwhile, humanity's swelling numbers and rising consumption patterns are pushing against the planet's finite boundaries. According to projections, maintaining our current dietary trends while feeding the nearly 10 billion people expected by 2050 would require increasing food production by well over 50%.  

And all of this plays out against a backdrop of intensifying great power rivalry between the US, China, and increasingly assertive revisionist forces. In a more siloed, conflict-prone world, can we rely on the resilience of global supply chains and coordinated international action? Already we see protectionist tendencies and export restrictions, with countries stockpiling grains and fertilizers as strategic reserves.

So how do we chart a path toward SDG 2's promise of a hunger-free world by 2030? For starters, we need radical transformations of our agricultural systems to enhance productivity through sustainable intensification – more crops per drop while minimizing environmental footprints. This means embracing innovations like precision agriculture, biotechnology, urban vertical farming, and plant-based proteins. Equal priority must go toward empowering smallholder farmers, especially women, with access to credit, modern inputs, technologies, and markets.

Crucially, we have to re-architect global food systems for resilience against climate shocks through enhanced regional self-sufficiency. Simply doubling down on highly efficient but hyper-specialized industrial monocultures leaves us dangerously vulnerable to disruptions. We need heterogeneous, regionally-adapted food production that can withstand climate extremes and pest outbreaks. Strategic grain reserves and emergency logistics must be pre-positioned, coupled with binding multilateral agreements preventing export bans.

But for all our ingenuity, technological prowess alone cannot paper over the existential challenge of feeding nearly 10 billion people on an increasingly degraded planet. We must finally muster the collective will to tackle humanity's unsustainable population growth – an indelicate truth that too many tiptoe around for fear of sparking controversies over reproductive rights and cultural norms. Pursuing gender equity through universal education and female empowerment is the most important lever we have for humanely stabilizing our numbers.

In the end, ending hunger requires taking a hard look at humanity's meta-trajectory and making some profoundly difficult choices. Do we continue our reckless environmental vandalism, depleting the world's carbon-sinks and freshwater reserves until regional breadbaskets go up in flames? Do we charge ahead with unconstrained growth in human numbers and consumption, blind to the limits of a finite planet? Or do we muster the courage and foresight to fundamentally transform our relationship with the natural world – rethinking our agricultural, economic, political, and demographic realities with a sharpened focus on resilience, equity, and sustainability?

The answers will determine whether we consign swelling millions to hunger, starvation, and desperation – or whether we rise to the occasion as a species, aligning with ecological boundaries while upholding human dignity and our common humanity.

This is the defining challenge of the 21st century. We have been served notice. How we respond will shape civilizational outcomes for generations to come.
