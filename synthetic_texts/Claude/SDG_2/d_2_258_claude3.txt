Here is a draft academic article about SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) from the perspective of economist David Autor:

The Relentless Challenge of Achieving Sustainable Food Security

By David Autor

The drive to end world hunger represents one of the most vital yet vexing challenges facing the global community. Enshrined as the second Sustainable Development Goal, the imperative to "end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture" encapsulates a multitude of intersecting priorities. It demands that we ameliorate the immediate plight of the 690 million people suffering from chronic undernourishment. But it also requires that we safeguard the long-term capacity to feed a projected world population of nearly 10 billion by 2050, all while respecting planetary boundaries and fostering climate resilience.  

Regrettably, far from making satisfactory progress, recent years have seen a reversal of the modest gains achieved in the preceding decades. Propelled by the compounding strains of armed conflicts, extreme climate events, and most recently the COVID-19 pandemic's disruptive tremors, world hunger has been rising since 2014. This grim trajectory underscores both the fragility of our global food systems and the enormity of the obstacles impeding SDG 2's realization.

Enhancing agricultural productivity emerges as a pivotal imperative, one complicated by the intractable quandary of raising crop yields while curtailing demand for scarce resources like water, energy and arable land. Sustainable intensification—centered on judicious applications of technologies, fertilizers, seeds and equipment—offers one potential pathway forward. But the impressive productivity gains it catalyzes in prime agricultural regions often prove elusive in the predominantly small-holder systems that prop up food production across much of the developing world.  

Another formidable challenge springs from the threat climate change poses to crop viability in regions already strained by high temperatures and unreliable rainfall. The geographical redistribution of agricultural capacity, hastened by altered precipitation patterns and rising temperatures, could inherently compromise food security by increasing transport costs, straining domestic supply chains, and impeding cross-border commodity flows. Minimizing such disruptions will likely necessitate a shift toward more regionally-tailored crop portfolios and agricultural techniques better calibrated for local climate realities.

Perhaps the greatest hurdle, though, lies in rectifying the structural inequalities that relegate nearly 60 percent of the world's undernourished people to concentrated pockets across just eight nations. Poverty, conflict, inadequate infrastructure, gender discrimination and weak institutional capacity all represent stubborn impediments to combatting pervasive hunger. And as mass rural-urban migration increasingly concentrates populations in urban food deserts devoid of arable land, growing shares of the world's neediest people are marooned beyond the easy reach of traditional food distribution channels.

Tackling this intricate nexus will assuredly require multifaceted solutions transcending the agricultural sphere. Efforts spanning economic revitalization, peacebuilding initiatives, climate adaptation investments, women's empowerment programs and governance reforms may collectively hold the key to dislodging ingrained inequities and hardwiring resiliency across at-risk populations. Yet, these necessarily protracted solutions risk prioritizing longer-term objectives over more immediate hunger alleviation imperatives.

As the countdown toward the 2030 horizon progresses, the stark reality remains that existing efforts remain inadequate to bend the curve on world hunger. Achieving SDG 2 will demand not merely redoubled resource commitments, but a fundamental reconceptualization of how we approach food security writ large. Incremental tinkering cannot resolve systemic frailties; truly sustainable solutions will emanate only from embracing innovative, integrative and robustly-funded interventions at the nexus of agriculture, climate adaptation, conflict resolution, gender parity and equitable development.

That the world has for centuries wrestled with the scourge of hunger reflects how immense are the challenges at hand. But it should also steel our resolve to finally banish this moral blight. Our collective capacity to achieve this hinges not merely on technological ingenuity or targeted investments, but on summoning the moral courage to erect a more just and sustainable global food system.
