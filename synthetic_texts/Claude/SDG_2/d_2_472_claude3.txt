Here is a detailed newspaper article about Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger), written from the perspective of Fortune magazine:

Solving Global Hunger is the Key to Unlocking Trillions in Economic Growth

By Fortune Editorial Board

In the world's relentless pursuit of economic growth and prosperity, one of the most fundamental roadblocks is tragically being overlooked: hunger. The statistics are staggering - nearly 1 in 10 people globally are undernourished, and the economic impacts reverberate across all sectors. Businesses take note: The path to vibrant new markets and catalyzing an abundance of human potential lies in finally achieving Sustainable Development Goal 2 - Zero Hunger.  

The human costs of hunger are heartbreaking, with millions of children facing lifelong impacts on health, cognitive development and future earnings potential. But the economic tolls are equally devastating. The global economy shoulders an estimated $3.5 trillion per year in health costs and lost productivity due to undernourishment according to UN agencies. Countries with high rates of hunger have up to 9.4% less economic growth per year compared to those with none. Just a 1% rise in hunger correlates with a subsequent 0.8% increase in poverty.

Forward-thinking business leaders must recognize hunger as both a moral and strategic imperative that demands action. With smart, targeted interventions, the private sector can lay the groundwork for a zero-hunger world that unlocks tremendous economic dynamism. How transformative would it be to add hundreds of millions of vigorous minds and bodies into productive economic participation? What innovation and entrepreneurial drive could emerge if so many of the world's people were freed from calorie deprivation?

Companies like Nestl√©, PepsiCo and Walmart are already making crucial strides through sustainable agriculture programs that support smallholder farmers. Technology giants like Microsoft are lending AI capabilities to optimize crop yields and supply chains. Payment innovators enable food vouchers and safety net programs. Companies that invest in ending hunger build a future of healthier, wealthier customers and more productive workers. With strategic environmental, social and governance (ESG) prioritization, the entire private sector has transformative power to end this man-made crisis.

But achieving Zero Hunger requires a multifaceted approach beyond corporate initiatives alone. Governments must invest in resilient food systems, rural infrastructure, agricultural research, technology and equitable resource distribution. The fossil fuel status quo and industrialized agricultural practices that degrade soils must rapidly evolve. Climate change impacts like extreme weather and environmental degradation exacerbate food insecurity and disproportionately harm the world's most vulnerable populations. A stable future depends on sustainable food production and climate resilience.

Solving world hunger is an audacious ambition that carries an astronomical economic upside potential. With roughly one in four humans afflicted by some form of malnutrition, fully nourishing the global population would be akin to adding billions of productive participants to the world's workforce and markets. In our globalized economy, regions marred by food scarcity become hotbeds for poverty, instability, mass migration and conflict that disrupt commercial activity and supply chains. The perpetual cycle of poverty and hunger robs nations of human capital and forfeits trillions in potential economic growth.

The world has the resources to solve hunger, yet a staggering $10 trillion is wasted each year on economic costs related to hunger and food waste by some estimates. It is long past time to shift that paradigm and unleash an economic bonanza that can come from properly nourishing the global population. Companies that recognize this imperative and mobilize investments into SDG2 strategies will position themselves as pioneers blazing the trail into the most important emerging markets - the billions of human minds and bodies currently shackled by food deprivation. The ROI opportunities of success are as morally righteous as they are economically transformative.
