BRAC, a leading international development organization, presents a comprehensive analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2): "End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture." This report delves into the current state of global food systems, highlighting the challenges and opportunities in achieving this crucial goal.

The world has made significant strides in reducing hunger and malnutrition over the past decades, yet the progress remains uneven and fragile. Despite a decline in the prevalence of undernourishment, nearly 690 million people worldwide still face chronic hunger, with the majority residing in developing countries. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this crisis, pushing millions more into food insecurity and reversing years of hard-won gains.

Achieving SDG 2 requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the root causes of hunger, malnutrition, and unsustainable agricultural practices. One of the key challenges lies in the persistent inequalities and inequities that exist within and across countries. Poverty, conflict, climate change, and limited access to resources and markets disproportionately impact the most vulnerable populations, including smallholder farmers, women, and marginalized communities.

Sustainable agriculture lies at the heart of SDG 2, as it not only ensures food security but also contributes to environmental preservation and climate resilience. However, current agricultural practices often prioritize short-term productivity over long-term sustainability, leading to soil degradation, water scarcity, and biodiversity loss. The overreliance on chemical inputs, monocultures, and intensive farming methods has taken a toll on the planet's finite resources, compromising the ability of future generations to meet their food needs.

To address these challenges, BRAC advocates for a holistic and transformative approach that integrates sustainable agricultural practices with social protection programs, improved nutrition interventions, and resilience-building measures. This includes promoting climate-smart agriculture, which combines traditional knowledge with modern technologies to enhance productivity while minimizing environmental impacts. Agroecological farming practices, such as crop diversification, integrated pest management, and conservation agriculture, can significantly improve soil health, water conservation, and biodiversity, while also increasing yields and resilience to climate shocks.

Nutrition security is another critical component of SDG 2, as malnutrition remains a persistent challenge, particularly in developing countries. BRAC emphasizes the importance of diversifying diets and promoting the consumption of nutrient-rich foods, including fruits, vegetables, and animal-source proteins. This requires a multisectoral approach that encompasses education, behavior change communication, and fortification strategies, as well as addressing the underlying social determinants of malnutrition, such as poverty, gender inequality, and limited access to healthcare and clean water.

Furthermore, BRAC recognizes the crucial role of social protection programs in enhancing food security and nutrition. Cash transfers, school feeding programs, and targeted subsidies can provide a safety net for vulnerable populations, enabling them to access nutritious foods and invest in productive assets. These interventions should be coupled with capacity-building initiatives that empower communities to develop sustainable livelihoods and strengthen their resilience to shocks and stresses.

Achieving SDG 2 also requires addressing the structural barriers that hinder equitable access to resources, markets, and decision-making processes. BRAC advocates for policies and programs that support smallholder farmers, particularly women, by providing access to land, credit, extension services, and market opportunities. Investing in rural infrastructure, such as roads, storage facilities, and processing units, can significantly reduce post-harvest losses and improve market linkages, thereby increasing incomes and food security.

Effective governance, multi-stakeholder partnerships, and international cooperation are essential for creating an enabling environment that supports the achievement of SDG 2. BRAC calls for strengthening institutional capacities, enhancing policy coherence, and fostering collaboration among governments, civil society organizations, the private sector, and international development partners. This includes promoting knowledge-sharing, technology transfer, and resource mobilization to support sustainable agricultural practices, food security initiatives, and nutrition interventions.

In conclusion, achieving SDG 2 is a complex and multifaceted challenge that requires a comprehensive and coordinated approach. BRAC's analysis emphasizes the need for a paradigm shift towards sustainable and resilient food systems that prioritize environmental stewardship, social equity, and economic viability. By addressing the root causes of hunger, malnutrition, and unsustainable agricultural practices, and fostering inclusive and resilient communities, we can pave the way for a world where no one goes hungry and everyone has access to nutritious and sustainable food.
