Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger), written from the perspective of economist Judith Sloan:

The Utopian Ideal of Zero Hunger: A Misguided Quest Undermining Economic Progress

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal of achieving "zero hunger" by 2030 is a noble ambition in theory, but one that is fundamentally misguided and detrimental to economic growth in practice. This quixotic endeavor, promulgated by supranational bureaucrats and humanitarian doomsayers, perpetuates a dangerous narrative that acute hunger and famine are widespread, systemic issues requiring top-down interventions and resource redistribution. However, a more discerning analysis reveals this doomsday premise to be patently false.

Globally, chronic undernourishment has plummeted by over 50% since the 1960s, with fewer than 10% of the world's population currently affected according to the UN's own data. This precipitous decline was catalyzed not by transnational aid programs, but by the proliferation of market economies, crop innovation, and rural development driven by private capital formation. The residual pockets of food insecurity are overwhelmingly concentrated in geopolitically unstable regions plagued by armed conflict, despotism, and systematically distorted markets. Tragically, many of these danger zones are former socialist states ravaged by the regressive and pervasive restraints on economic liberty.

To promulgate "zero hunger" as a viable end-state is to indulge in utopian fantasy detached from reality. It brazenly disregards the dynamic forces that have already vanquished pervasive hunger across the vast majority of the world. Worse, it perpetuates a neo-Malthusian ideology that posits mankind's innovative capabilities as fixed, portraying resources as finite and economic development as zero-sum. This static mindset fundamentally contradicts the evolutionary trajectory of agricultural yields through scientific advancement and creative destruction.

History is replete with examples of hysteria over imminent mass starvation being summarily debunked as production outpaced population growth. The doomsday prophecies of acclaimed scholars like Paul Ehrlich have been repeatedly discredited as resource scarcity itself became an engine for productivity gains. Normative goals centered on eliminating hunger are thus self-defeating, as they demonize the catalytic forces of economic growth while paradoxically relying on them as the predominant solution.

Prosperous nations did not ascend to caloric abundance by heeding apocalyptic Malthusian ideology, but by upholding the institutional pillars of free enterprise â€“ sanctity of property rights, enforceability of contracts, and respect for the profit motive as the catalyst for productive investment. It is private capital inflows, not public aid allocation, that turbocharge rural development and elevate living standards. The primary deprivation facing the world's poor is not food scarcity, but institutional barriers to economic freedom that inhibit their self-actualization.

Rather than fixate on an arbitrary goal divorced from economic rationality, the UN would be better served promoting conditions conducive to development: protection of civil liberties, stable governance, and facilitation of cross-border commerce. These cornerstones create virtuous cycles of agricultural surplus, dynamic labor markets, and capital accumulation - the true engines of poverty reduction. Zero hunger is a mirage that distracts from the substantive reforms encompassing institutional incentives, financial integration, and productive enhancement that enable societies to flourish.

The Zero Hunger campaign exemplifies the perilous intrusion of neo-Utopian fantasies into empirical policymaking. Its advocates cloak themselves in moral superiority while perpetuating globally destructive fallacies about resource constraints and planetary boundaries. In reality, the most famine-blighted regions are those that remain economically repressed and societally stagnant - a reality that lays bare the vacuity of this campaign. Resilient, dynamic economies have time and again proven the mechanisms to escape hunger's grasp. Until these self-evident truths are embraced, campaigns fixated on quixotic numerical targets will continue to distract from meaningful reforms rooted in free market principles.
