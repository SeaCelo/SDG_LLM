Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger), written from the perspective of George Monbiot:

The persistence of hunger in the 21st century is an outrage, a mark of systemic global injustice and failed priorities. Despite the veneer of progress peddled by corporations and governments, the hard facts reveal a catastrophic betrayal of our moral imperative to provide every human being on this planet with adequate nutrition. 

Far from delivering "Zero Hunger" by 2030 as pledged, current trajectories under the prevailing neoliberal hegemony condemn millions more to malnutrition, stunting, and premature death from starvation. This is a reality crafted not by nature's constraints but by the ideological blinkers and vested interests shaping the global food system.

Agribusiness giants like Bayer, Syngenta, and Corteva propagate an insidious myth – that industrialized, chemically-drenched monoculture farming reliant on GMOs and rampant habitat destruction represents our only hope of "feeding the world." In truth, this corporatized model, buttressed by draconian intellectual property regimes denying seed sovereignty, perpetuates a cycle of ecocide, soil degradation, and rural immiseration propelling hunger and malnutrition.

The inconvenient reality is that feeding the world's population is not fundamentally a production challenge but a distribution crisis – a catastrophic failure to ensure universal food security and nutrition. Globally, humans produce enough caloric output to feed over 10 billion people. But Malthusian fantasies of scarcity provide ideological cover for privatizing, corporatizing, and consolidating control over the global food supply.

Industrial agriculture externalizes its ruinous environmental costs onto the poor and marginalized, destroying ecosystems, depleting aquifers, and steadily eroding the natural capital that genuine food security ultimately depends upon. Peasant farmers, indigenous communities, and the rural poor suffer disproportionately, driven into destitution by agribusiness land grabs and degradation of the very resource base needed for agroecological sustainability.

True food sovereignty hinges not on greater fealty to proprietary agribusiness dogmas, but on devolving control to the local level through redistributive land reform, democratizing resource access, and promoting integrated, biodiverse models of small-scale organic production. Transforming global food systems requires dismantling the neoliberal policy architecture incentivizing ecocidal extraction – slashing the $700 billion in annual subsidies warping the entire system toward overproduction of staple crops by the agroindustrial elite.

Funding must flow instead towards decentralized, ecologically-regenerative approaches, reversing decades of hostility to food self-sufficiency in the Global South. Real sustainability means reviving indigenous polyculture techniques tailored to local environments, restoring soils and watersheds, preserving crucial agrobiodiversity, and empowering those at the frontlines of hunger.

Let us shrug off the doublespeak of public-private "partnerships" manipulated by food behemoths like Cargill and ADM to advance corporate interests. Instead, facing harsh ecological limits and the existential threat of climate breakdown, we must catalyze a radical paradigm shift – a great "regreening" through agro-ecological methods rooted in environmental justice and autonomy for farmers and rural communities globally.

Zero Hunger demands not an intensification of industrial interventions, but a renaissance of the rural, a celebration of bioculturally-attuned food practices honoring human stakeholdership in the land. Only by dismantling concentrations of economic power subverting socio-ecological resilience can we create a truly nourishing, equitable and sustainable basis for feeding humanity. The status quo is literally starving us: it's time to cultivate an agro-ecological revolution.
