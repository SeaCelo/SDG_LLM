Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 2: Zero Hunger as if written by Piers Akerman, an Australian conservative political commentator:

The Utopian Folly of the UN's Zero Hunger Goal

By Piers Akerman, Distinguished Fellow at the Institut Pour La Liberté

The hubris of the United Nations never ceases to amaze. Their grandiose Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of achieving Zero Hunger by 2030 is a laughable fantasy that reveals the UN's alarming detachment from reality. This wildly unrealistic aim of ending hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition in under a decade is simply virtue-signaling of the highest order.

The fact is that hunger has been an immutable part of the human condition since time immemorial. Even in our modern, technologically-advanced era, hundreds of millions globally suffer from chronic undernourishment. To think we can somehow engineer a utopian world free of hunger in a few short years is pure ideological folly.  

The root causes of hunger are multifarious and deeply intertwined with complex socio-economic, political, and environmental factors. Poverty, conflict, poor governance, lack of investment in agriculture, food distribution failures, environmental degradation, and population growth collectively make hunger an intractable challenge that development economists have grappled with for decades. 

Yet the UN brazenly promises to solve this age-old scourge with a few trite targets about improving agricultural productivity, investment, land rights, and food commodity markets. This reductive, top-down approach betrays an alarming ignorance of the enormity of the task at hand.

In truth, the free market has proven itself as the most powerful force for reducing hunger and uplifting the world's poor over the past decades. It is economic growth, trade, entrepreneurship, and the profit motive that have incentivized agricultural innovation, bolstered food production, and catalyzed prosperity. Not pie-in-the-sky UN diktats.

Hunger will persist as long as misguided collectivist policies suppress economic freedom and individual rights in many parts of the developing world. From the killing fields of socialist Zimbabwe to the command economies of the "Bolivarian" revolution, it is centralized control over agriculture and markets that causes famine and immiserates the masses, not the lack of a UN hunger compact.

In prospering nations where property rights are enshrined and economic freedom reigns, hunger and food insecurity have been all but eliminated. Just look to the capitalist dynamos of Asia as an example. As these formerly destitute nations embraced the market, their citizens were lifted out of poverty and achieved food self-sufficiency.  

When will the UN ideologues recognize that only through further liberation of economies can the developing world put an end to hunger? The answer is never – the internationalist bureaucrats in their plush Manhattan redoubt remain steadfastly committed to their dogma of centralized planning over market solutions.

So the Zero Hunger campaign will remain a cruel mirage, a false monument to the UN's grandiose ambitions. The well-fed bureaucrats congratulating themselves on this latest target should feel shame, not self-satisfaction. For it is their very philosophy standing in the way of true hunger eradication through economic emancipation. Zero self-awareness, unfortunately, is something the UN's utopians have in plentiful supply.
