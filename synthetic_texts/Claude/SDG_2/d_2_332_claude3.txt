Esteemed colleagues and peers,

The pursuit of Sustainable Development Goal 2 – Zero Hunger – has been a paramount endeavor for Liechtensteinische Entwicklungsdienst (LED), as we strive to eradicate hunger, achieve food security, and promote sustainable agriculture worldwide. Our unwavering commitment to this cause is rooted in the fundamental belief that access to adequate and nutritious food is a basic human right, and the cornerstone of a just and equitable society.

In our relentless efforts to combat hunger, we have adopted a multifaceted approach that encompasses various dimensions of the food system. Our strategic interventions are tailored to address the unique challenges faced by diverse regions, cultures, and socio-economic contexts. We recognize that hunger is not merely a consequence of insufficient food production, but a complex interplay of environmental, economic, social, and political factors.

In the arid regions of the Sahel, for instance, our focus has been on enhancing climate-resilient agricultural practices. By introducing drought-resistant crop varieties, promoting water harvesting techniques, and facilitating access to sustainable irrigation systems, we have empowered local communities to withstand the adverse effects of climate change and ensure food availability even in the harshest of conditions.

Furthermore, our endeavors in Southeast Asia have centered around sustainable intensification of smallholder farming systems. Through the dissemination of agroecological approaches, such as intercropping, integrated pest management, and conservation agriculture, we have fostered a harmonious coexistence between agricultural productivity and environmental preservation. This has not only bolstered food security but also safeguarded the long-term viability of ecosystems, ensuring a lasting legacy for future generations.

In regions plagued by conflicts and political instability, our efforts have been geared towards strengthening the resilience of food systems. We have collaborated with local stakeholders to establish community-based seed banks, fostering the preservation of diverse crop varieties and ensuring seed sovereignty. Additionally, our initiatives have focused on developing robust supply chain networks, facilitating the efficient distribution of food aid, and mitigating the adverse impacts of disruptions on vulnerable populations.

Recognizing the inextricable link between gender equality and food security, we have placed a strong emphasis on empowering women in the agricultural sector. Through targeted capacity-building programs, access to resources, and the promotion of gender-sensitive policies, we have fostered an enabling environment for women to thrive as agricultural entrepreneurs, decision-makers, and agents of change within their communities.

Our commitment to sustainable agriculture extends beyond the immediate realm of food production. We have actively advocated for the adoption of circular economy principles, promoting the efficient use of resources, minimizing waste, and fostering closed-loop systems. By encouraging the repurposing of agricultural by-products and the recovery of nutrients from organic waste, we have contributed to the development of regenerative and self-sustaining food systems.

Moreover, our efforts have encompassed the integration of indigenous knowledge systems and traditional practices into modern agricultural techniques. By valuing and preserving the rich tapestry of cultural heritage, we have fostered a harmonious synthesis of time-honored wisdom and cutting-edge innovations, creating solutions that resonate with local communities and promote sustainable livelihoods.

As we navigate the complex challenges of the 21st century, our commitment to Sustainable Development Goal 2 remains steadfast. We recognize that achieving zero hunger is not merely a noble aspiration but an imperative for the well-being of our planet and its inhabitants. Through our collaborative efforts, we strive to create a world where hunger is a distant memory, and where every individual has access to sufficient, nutritious, and sustainable food sources.
