Here's a long academic article about SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) in the satirical style of Dave Barry:

Call me a visionary, but I have this crazy idea that people shouldn't starve to death. I know, I know, it sounds downright radical, but hear me out. We live in a world where overconsumption is the norm, where we have cupcake ATMs (true story) and fidget spinner collections (also true), yet millions of people go hungry every single day. It's like we're living in some twisted reality show called "Hunger Games, but for Real This Time."

Now, I'm no economist or anything, but it seems to me that having a bunch of hungry people around is bad for business. Think about it: if everyone's too busy trying not to die of starvation, who's going to buy all those male leggings and bacon-scented air fresheners? That's right, nobody. The global economy would grind to a halt faster than you can say "blockchain cryptocurrency" (which, let's be honest, nobody really understands).

But it's not just about the economy, folks. It's about basic human decency. We're supposed to be this highly evolved species, capable of sending robots to Mars and creating apps that tell us how many calories are in a single leaf of spinach. Yet we can't seem to figure out how to get food to the people who need it most? That's like trying to put together an IKEA bookshelf without losing your mind – it should be a basic skill we've mastered by now.

Of course, solving world hunger isn't as simple as just handing out free cheeseburgers to everyone (although that would be a good start). It's a complex issue with roots in poverty, conflict, climate change, and probably a few other things I'm forgetting because I got distracted by a squirrel outside my window. But that's no excuse for inaction.

Think about all the resources we waste on ridiculous things like indoor waterparks and those tiny umbrellas they put in fancy cocktails. Imagine if we redirected even a fraction of that towards sustainable agriculture, food distribution systems, and teaching people how to grow their own organic kale (because apparently, that's a thing people want to do now).

And let's not forget about food waste. We live in a world where perfectly good food gets thrown away because it's not aesthetically pleasing enough for our Instagram feeds. I'm talking about those slightly misshapen carrots and tomatoes with little blemishes – the kinds of imperfect produce that would have been gobbled up without a second thought back in our hunter-gatherer days.

Look, I'm not saying solving world hunger is going to be easy. It's going to take a massive coordinated effort from governments, NGOs, and probably a few eccentric billionaires who have way too much money and not enough hobbies. But if we can put a man on the moon and invent cheese in a spray can, surely we can figure out how to get food to the people who need it most.

So let's get our act together, people. Let's stop worrying about trivial things like whether pineapple belongs on pizza (it doesn't) and start focusing on the real issues. Because at the end of the day, a world where everyone has enough to eat is a world where we can finally move on to more important debates, like whether hotdogs are sandwiches (they're not, and if you think otherwise, we can't be friends).
