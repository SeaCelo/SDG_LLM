Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 2 - Zero Hunger, written from the perspective of conservative commentator Dennis Prager:

The second of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals is to "End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture." On the surface, this may seem like an admirable and humanitarian aim. After all, who could be against ensuring that all people have enough food to eat and proper nutrition? However, a deeper examination reveals that this SDG is rooted in the same misguided leftist ideology that has caused so much suffering and privation around the world.

At its core, the zero hunger goal is a top-down, government-planned program that naively believes that global hunger and malnutrition can be solved by bureaucratic edicts, wealth redistribution, and centralized control over food production and distribution. This is the same flawed mentality that led to the horrific famines, shortages, and mass starvation in communist nations like the Soviet Union, China, and North Korea. Does the UN really think it can do better than these failed Marxist states in managing the world's food supply?

The fundamental truth is that hunger and food insecurity are not just problems of scarcity, but also issues of poverty, corruption, and lack of economic freedom. Countries with economic liberty, property rights, and free markets have virtually eliminated famine and hunger. When people are allowed to profit from their labor, they have both the means and motivation to be productive and feed themselves and their families. Top-down agricultural collectivization, however, destroys these vital incentives.

Moreover, the SDG's emphasis on promoting "sustainable agriculture" is merely a Trojan horse for implementing economically destructive environmental policies that will impoverish the developing world under the guise of preventing climate change. The result will inevitably be less economic growth, fewer jobs, and more hunger and malnutrition, not less.

Rather than more misguided global programs, the real solution to hunger and nutrition deficiencies is to encourage free market capitalism, private property rights, and limited government interference in the production and trade of food. Allow prices to fluctuate naturally based on supply and demand, get rid of protectionist policies that hinder imports to food-poor nations, and stop government confiscation of agricultural lands and farms.

If the UN was truly committed to ending hunger, it would be advocating for economic liberty and democratic governance as the proven catalysts for prosperity. Sadly, this agenda reveals the UN's ideological blind spot â€“ a stubborn belief that problems can be solved by centralized control rather than free individuals pursuing their rational self-interest. It's the same old socialist fantasy that has brought so much misery in the past.
