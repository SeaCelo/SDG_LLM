Here goes, a long academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) from the perspective of Jeremy Clarkson:

Well, well, well. If it isn't the tree-hugging brigade again with their big book of made-up problems. This time it's about food, which as far as I can tell, isn't in short supply anywhere that matters. I mean, have you seen the queues at the Harvester on a Saturday night? Packed to the rafters with people shoveling food into their face-buckets like it's going out of fashion.

But apparently, we're meant to be worried that some people in countries I couldn't point to on a map don't have enough to eat. Well boo-hoo. Maybe they should get a job instead of relying on handouts from people like me who actually work for a living.

Now, I know what you're thinking - "But Jeremy, sustainable agriculture and food security are crucial for reducing poverty and promoting economic growth!" To which I say, what a bunch of buzzword-spouting tosh. If people are starving, just send them the number for Deliveroo and be done with it.

These do-gooders always want to make things more complicated than they need to be. All this talk of improving "agricultural productivity" and "sustainable food production systems" just sounds like more red tape to me. What's wrong with good old-fashioned farming the way we've done it for centuries? You stick a seed in the ground, you water it, and bam - food on the table. Hardly rocket science, is it?

And then they start banging on about "resilient agricultural practices" and "maintaining ecosystems." I'll tell you what's resilient - a nice powerful V8 engine that can shake off anything Mother Nature throws at it. You want to see an ecosystem? Pop down to the NÃ¼rburgring and watch a real pro at work.

Speaking of pros, that's exactly what we need more of in this famously over-regulated industry. Farmers tied up in so much bureaucratic nonsense they can barely move for forms to fill out. Ridiculous. Give them a tank of diesel, a plough, and a copy of Jeremy Clarkson's Favourite Farm Smashes and let them get on with it.

While we're at it, we might as well sort out the "equal access to land" and "secure tenure rights" for good measure. How's this for a nice simple solution: Anyone who wants to be a farmer rocks up, sticks a flag in a field, and gets to work. A bigcountry like Australia must have plenty of spareacreage - just Give It A Crack and start ploughing.

There, I've solved world hunger in 500 words or less. You're welcome, world. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got a packed lunch of foie gras and caviar to tuck into. God, I love the glamorous limo-riding life of an agricultural expert.
