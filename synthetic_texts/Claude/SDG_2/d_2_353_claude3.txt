The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2, "Zero Hunger," is a global call to action to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. This ambitious objective aims to address the multifaceted challenges of hunger and malnutrition, which are inextricably linked to poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation.

In this analytical report, we delve into the current state of SDG 2, examining the progress made, challenges encountered, and innovative strategies employed by various stakeholders to combat hunger and malnutrition worldwide.

Despite significant advancements in agricultural productivity and food availability over the past decades, hunger and malnutrition remain persistent global issues. According to the latest figures from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), nearly 690 million people were undernourished in 2019, with the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbating this crisis. The prevalence of stunting among children under five years of age, a key indicator of chronic malnutrition, has declined but remains unacceptably high at 21.3% globally.

The root causes of hunger and malnutrition are multidimensional, encompassing factors such as poverty, conflict, climate change, and unsustainable agricultural practices. In many developing nations, smallholder farmers, who constitute a substantial portion of the rural population, face numerous challenges, including limited access to productive resources, markets, and modern agricultural technologies. Additionally, the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, coupled with environmental degradation, pose significant threats to food production systems and the livelihoods of farming communities.

To address these challenges, a holistic approach is required, integrating interventions across various sectors and involving diverse stakeholders. Sustainable agricultural practices, such as agroecology, conservation agriculture, and climate-smart agriculture, have gained traction as viable solutions for enhancing food production while minimizing environmental impact and building resilience to climate change.

Furthermore, initiatives aimed at empowering smallholder farmers, particularly women, through access to extension services, credit, and markets, have demonstrated positive outcomes in improving food security and nutrition. For instance, the Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) in Ethiopia, a large-scale social protection intervention, has effectively addressed chronic food insecurity and promoted sustainable land management practices among participating households.

Innovative technologies, including precision agriculture, biotechnology, and digital solutions, hold immense potential for increasing agricultural productivity, reducing post-harvest losses, and improving market access for smallholder farmers. However, ensuring the equitable distribution and adoption of these technologies remains a challenge, necessitating collaborative efforts between governments, research institutions, and the private sector.

Addressing malnutrition requires a multisectoral approach that goes beyond increasing food availability. Interventions targeting the first 1,000 days of a child's life, encompassing maternal nutrition, breastfeeding promotion, and complementary feeding practices, have proven to be effective in combating stunting and other forms of malnutrition. Fortification of staple foods and dietary diversification through the promotion of nutrient-rich crops have also contributed to improving nutritional outcomes.

Achieving SDG 2 is intrinsically linked to the realization of other Sustainable Development Goals, such as SDG 1 (No Poverty), SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), SDG 5 (Gender Equality), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 15 (Life on Land). Collaborative efforts across sectors and stakeholders are crucial to addressing the underlying drivers of hunger and malnutrition, fostering sustainable and resilient food systems, and ensuring equitable access to nutritious and affordable food for all.
