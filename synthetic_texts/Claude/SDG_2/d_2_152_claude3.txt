Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger), drafted as if written by Gail Collins:

The Quest to End Hunger: A Gordian Knot of Injustice and Inequity
By Gail Collins

When we ponder the great afflictions plaguing humankind, few loom as large or as unconscionable as hunger. It is a brutal scourge that stunts bodies and minds, robs millions of their potential, and perpetuates a vicious cycle of destitution spanning generations. The statistics are as stark as they are shameful - nearly 690 million people worldwide suffered from chronic undernourishment in 2019, their hollow bellies crying out for justice.  

Yet this catastrophic reality is not, as some would have us believe, an inevitable byproduct of scarcity or Malthusian folly. No, it is the wholly human-wrought consequence of grotesque imbalances in wealth, power, and opportunity that render billions mere spectators to the globe's dizzying abundance. A bitter harvest sown by centuries of conflict, colonialism, and kleptocracy.

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 2 represents our latest and most ambitious attempt to extricate humanity from this morass of deprivation. Its call to "end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture" by 2030 encapsulates the interlocking challenges we face. For the path ahead is littered with thorns - demographic pressures, ecological devastation, economic iniquities, technological disruption, and deeply-entrenched patriarchies that relegate far too many women to second-class status.

Tackling hunger requires nothing less than a root-and-branch overhaul of the very firmaments of our global food systems. From the nutrient-depleted soil of industrialized monocultures to the glaring inefficiencies baked into global supply chains, we have largely optimized for caloric output at the expense of nutritional integrity and long-term sustainability. The hidden environmental toll is staggering, with the agricultural sector responsible for an estimated one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions.  

Meanwhile, the corporatization and commodification of our food supply has paradoxically managed to make both hunger and obesity increasingly prevalent worldwide. In high-income nations awash in cheap, hyper-processed fare, poor nutritional outcomes are compounded by the clustering of "food deserts" in low-income communities. In the developing world, market consolidation and proprietary restrictions have undermined food sovereignty, trapping subsistence farmers in circuits of dependence while agribusiness giants rake in profits.

It will take a radical reimagination of ownership structures and policy incentives to realign our food systems around the sustainable, equitable provision of nutrient-dense crops. Public investment in infrastructure, research & development, and accessible financing for small-holder farmers must be massively scaled. Trade rules and anti-trust mechanisms must be overhauled to curtail the pernicious influence of monopolistic forces. Traditional agricultural methods and indigenous cultivation practices too often sidelined offer a deep well of wisdom on environmental stewardship.  

At the same time, we cannot divorce the fight against hunger from the intertwined struggles for gender equity, political reform, and economic justice. Chronic hunger disproportionately impacts women and girls, particularly in patriarchal societies where entrenched biases around property rights, education access, and reproductive autonomy imperil their full socioeconomic emancipation. Combating gender discrimination must be a core priority.

Similarly, we will not solve hunger without confronting the democratic deficits that sap nations of resources and resolve. Unchecked corruption and entrenched authoritarianism function as starvation's enablers, diverting vital funds and stifling policy innovation. And extreme income disparities both within and between countries only perpetuate food insecurity.

If this all seems an intractable Gordian knot of injustice and inequity, so be it. Great moral challenges forge great spirits. Ours is the duty to hack through with an unbending determination to dismantle the archaic hierarchies of humanity and remake our tangled food spheres into sustainable, egalitarian engines of human flourishing. The universal right to bodily integrity and a life of dignity free from want's harrowing maw is self-evident and inviolable.  

With patient, implacable effort informed by bold visions, we shall bend that moral arc ever closer towards nourishment and liberation for all. The contours of a hunger-free world flicker on the horizon, a prospect infinitely more delectable than any fleeting satiation of the belly. Let its exquisite fragrance stir our hearts and fortify our indefatigable march.
