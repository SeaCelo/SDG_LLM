Zero Hunger: A Macroeconomic Perspective on the Second Sustainable Development Goal
By Jordi Gali

The eradication of hunger and the pursuit of food security are central tenets of the United Nations' Second Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). However, the complex interplay between hunger, agricultural productivity, and macroeconomic dynamics warrants a deeper examination through the lens of modern economic theory. In this analysis, we shall delve into the intricate mechanisms that underpin the nexus between food insecurity, income disparities, and the propagation of business cycle fluctuations.

At the crux of our discourse lies the recognition that hunger is not merely a localized phenomenon but a manifestation of broader macroeconomic imbalances. The seminal work of Amartya Sen aptly underscored the pivotal role of entitlements in determining access to food, even in the presence of adequate aggregate supply. Extending this notion, we posit that hunger is inextricably linked to the distribution of income and wealth within a society, which in turn is shaped by the prevailing macroeconomic conditions.

The New Keynesian paradigm, with its emphasis on nominal rigidities and the consequent non-neutrality of monetary policy, offers a compelling framework for understanding the transmission of macroeconomic shocks to the agricultural sector and, ultimately, to food security. Adverse demand shocks, for instance, can precipitate a contraction in economic activity, leading to a decline in household incomes and a concomitant rise in poverty levels. This, in turn, can curtail access to nutritious food, exacerbating the prevalence of hunger, particularly among the most vulnerable segments of the population.

Moreover, the agricultural sector itself is susceptible to supply-side disturbances, such as adverse weather conditions, pests, or disruptions in the supply chain. The propagation of these shocks through the economy can be amplified by the presence of nominal rigidities, resulting in persistent deviations from the efficient allocation of resources and, consequently, a prolonged impact on food production and distribution.

Compounding these challenges is the inherent volatility of agricultural commodity prices, which can be influenced by a myriad of factors, including speculative activity in financial markets. The New Keynesian models of commodity price determination, pioneered by scholars like Pindyck and Rotemberg, highlight the intricate interplay between inventory dynamics, production lags, and the formation of expectations. Volatile and unpredictable price movements can undermine the profitability of agricultural enterprises, disincentivizing investment and hampering the long-term prospects for productivity growth in the sector.

Addressing these multifaceted challenges necessitates a comprehensive policy response that transcends the confines of traditional agricultural policies. Monetary and fiscal policies, hitherto primarily focused on stabilizing output and inflation, must be recalibrated to explicitly account for their implications for food security and the equitable distribution of resources.

One promising avenue lies in the exploration of state-contingent policy rules that explicitly target food security indicators, such as the prevalence of undernourishment or the depth of the food deficit. By incorporating these metrics into the policy reaction function, central banks and fiscal authorities could potentially mitigate the adverse consequences of economic fluctuations on food security, thereby enhancing the resilience of vulnerable populations.

Furthermore, the promotion of inclusive growth and the reduction of income inequalities should be elevated as primary policy objectives, recognizing their inextricable link to food security. Policies aimed at enhancing human capital accumulation, fostering financial inclusion, and promoting equitable access to productive resources can play a pivotal role in empowering individuals and communities to withstand economic shocks and maintain access to adequate nutrition.

Ultimately, the pursuit of the Second Sustainable Development Goal demands a paradigm shift in macroeconomic policymaking, one that acknowledges the inherent interdependence between economic stability, distributive justice, and food security. By integrating these considerations into the theoretical foundations and empirical analyses that guide policy formulation, we can pave the way for a more equitable and sustainable global food system, where hunger is not merely a statistic but a scourge eradicated through concerted economic and social progress.
