Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger), written from the perspective of the late economist Walter E. Williams:

Hunger and malnutrition remain severe global problems that we must confront head-on through the principles of economic freedom. The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 2 calls for ending hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture. While well-intentioned, this agenda represents a major overreach of bureaucratic central planning that grossly underestimates the power of free market capitalism and property rights as the proven solutions.

Let's start with some hard facts demonstrating the naivete of relying on governmentEdicts to solve something as complex as hunger. In market-oriented economies, caloric intake, food security, and nutrition indicators are highest. Conversely, abject poverty and hunger persist most severely in nations with socialist, centrally-controlled economic policies that distort incentives and suppress entrepreneurship. This is no mere coincidence - it is cause and effect.

In capitalist nations, farmers have clear ownership rights over their land and harvests. This creates powerful incentives to cultivate crops efficiently, implement new technologies, and earn profits by meeting consumer demand for affordable, quality foods. Competition and the profit motive breed innovation, such as drought-resistant seeds, efficient irrigation systems, and supply chain optimization to reduce food waste. Market prices serve as signals, allocating resources automatically without bureaucratic intervention.

By contrast, collectivized agriculture under socialist regimes has been an utter disaster withoutproperty rights. Inefficient government-run farms lacked incentives for productivity. Poor farmers were at the mercy of corrupt officials micromanaging their activities. Price controls consistently bred shortages and discoordination. The tragedies of famine and deprivation under regimes like the USSR, China under Mao, and elsewhere unmistakably showcase the fatal flaws of centralized economic planning and bureaucratic agriculture policies.

Even in relatively free societies, misguided government encroachments into agriculture disrupt the effective functioning of markets. Import quotas, tariffs, subsidies, and meddlesome regulations raise costs artificially while shielding producers from competitive pressures. The European Union's Soviet-style Common Agricultural Policy epitomizes the cronyism, waste, ecological damage, and market distortions caused by bureaucrats pretending they can rationally guide something as complex as a continent's food supply by decree.  

The solution is not more centralized control and taxpayer-funded handouts, but economic liberalization and private property rights. Low-income nations should privatize collectivized farming, establish secure land tenure, eliminate ruinous agricultural taxes and regulations, open markets to free trade, and let food producers respond to price signals and societal demands through voluntary exchange. These reforms powered dramatic agricultural revolutions from Japan and Taiwan to Chile and New Zealand, rapidly improving nutrition standards for their populations.

Nations like India, Nigeria, and others still mired in poverty must follow suit by getting central planners out of the way and embracing the economic freedoms that consistently prove most effective at empowering food production and eradicating hunger. Farmers fed their communities long before any bureaucrats decided to dictate agriculture policies.

Foreign aid certainly has a humanitarian role for emergency famine relief, but government-to-government wealth transfers perpetuate corruption and dependence rather than laying the foundations for sustained agricultural self-sufficiency. Private organizations, investment capital, and access to global markets do more to help the world's poor feed themselves through their ingenuity and hard work - the same principles that overcame hunger throughout human history before utopian bureaucrats hatched their quixotic campaign against an ancient reality they arrogantly presume they can legislate away.

The path to realizing SDG 2 requires understanding that hunger is not some novel predicament, but an age-old condition of poverty that persists precisely where people's freedoms are denied. Rather than subverting property rights and market forces, we must unleash their combined power to maximize food production efficiently in service of true human flourishing. That timeless formula consistently proves more effective than the utopian illusion of bureaucrats believing they can rationally substitute coercive planning for the proven merits of economic liberty.
