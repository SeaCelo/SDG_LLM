Here is a draft academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger), written from the perspective of conservative columnist Cal Thomas:

The Moral Imperative to End Hunger and Improve Food Security

By Cal Thomas

In a world of immense abundance, the fact that hundreds of millions still suffer from chronic hunger and malnutrition should strike us as an unconscionable moral failing. As people of faith and ethical conviction, we have a profound obligation to fight for the basic right of every human being to adequate and nutritious food.  

Hunger is not just a spiritual issue but one with enormous human consequences. Malnourishment in children permanently stunts physical and cognitive development, consigning the next generation to diminished prospects. Undernourished mothers are more likely to face life-threatening complications during childbirth. Hungry populations lack the strength and vitality for productive labor, entrenching cycles of poverty. Hunger fuels social unrest, conflict, and destabilization of nations. 

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 2 calls for an end to hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030, along with a doubling of agricultural productivity and incomes for small-scale food producers. These targets represent nothing less than a mobilization for the fundamental human right to be free from want and deprivation.

One might assume hunger is simply a supply problem – a failure to produce enough food. However, we already grow more than enough calories to feed every person on the planet. The principal causes are poverty, lack of investment in agriculture, food waste, and inadequate access and distribution systems – problems rooted in governance failures, misplaced priorities, and unequal economic development.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, recurrent drought and crop failure have been devastating, compounded by underinvestment in irrigation, rural infrastructure, and climate resilience measures. Hunger there is increasingly concentrated among marginalized groups like the rural poor, ethnic minorities, and families displaced by conflict, who lack the means to grow or purchase sufficient food.  

Across South Asia and parts of Latin America, childhood stunting remains appallingly high, reflecting multi-generational cycles of malnutrition stemming from policy neglect, gender inequalities that disadvantage mothers, poor sanitation, and other societal ills. Funding for nutrition interventions remains woefully inadequate.

In the developed world, our abundance has bred carelessness and gluttony. At least one third of food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted – moral decadence on a staggering scale considering children are dying of hunger. We squander agricultural resources while millions of farming families across Africa and Asia struggle at subsistence levels without access to financing, technologies and markets that could lift them to sustainable livelihoods.

Alleviating hunger is not just about growing more food, but ensuring it reaches the poor through inclusive value chains, rural development, social safety nets and direct nutrition assistance when needed. It requires investing in climate-resilient agriculture and strengthening local food systems. It means empowering rural women agricultural producers and addressing the societal injustices that deprive mothers and children of proper nourishment.

Affluent nations must lead in increasing development assistance, funding for humanitarian aid, and investing in agricultural research and resilient food systems in the developing world. Businesses must reform supply chains to reduce post-harvest waste and loss. Citizens of wealthy nations should examine our own habits of caloric excess and wasted abundance. 

Most importantly, we need a fundamental moral reawakening to the biblical truth that ample provision has been made for all of God's children, and that to deprive our brethren of daily bread violates the core tenets of every faith. What injustice could be greater than depriving the most vulnerable – infants and children – of nutrition required for life itself?

With cohesion of effort, adequately marshalled resources and moral resolve, the world can achieve SDG 2 and rid hunger from the Earth within our lifetimes. That certainly would rank among humanity's greatest achievements – a triumph of compassion to be celebrated in the highest.
