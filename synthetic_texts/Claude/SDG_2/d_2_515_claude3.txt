The Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2), "Zero Hunger," has profound implications for the accounting and economics discipline, as it intersects with issues of resource allocation, sustainable agriculture, and food security. This goal aims to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture â€“ objectives that are intrinsically tied to economic and accounting principles.

From an accounting perspective, the measurement and reporting of agricultural activities, food production, and distribution processes are critical for assessing progress towards SDG 2. Accounting standards and practices play a pivotal role in capturing the economic value of agricultural assets, tracking food supply chains, and monitoring the environmental impacts of farming practices. The development of robust accounting frameworks that incorporate sustainability metrics and non-financial disclosures is essential for promoting transparency and accountability in the agri-food sector.

Moreover, accounting principles can aid in the valuation of natural capital, such as arable land, water resources, and biodiversity, which are fundamental to sustainable agriculture. Traditional accounting methods often fail to capture the true costs of ecosystem degradation and resource depletion, leading to distorted economic decisions. Integrating environmental and social costs into accounting practices through techniques like natural capital accounting and environmental profit and loss statements can reveal the hidden costs of unsustainable agricultural practices and guide policymakers and businesses towards more sustainable alternatives.

From an economics perspective, achieving SDG 2 requires addressing market failures, resource allocation challenges, and policy interventions. Agricultural markets are often distorted by subsidies, trade barriers, and information asymmetries, leading to inefficient resource allocation and food insecurity. Economic analysis can shed light on the impact of these distortions and inform policy decisions aimed at creating well-functioning agricultural markets that incentivize sustainable production and equitable distribution.

Furthermore, the economics of food security and nutrition are closely linked to poverty alleviation, income inequality, and access to resources. Economists can contribute to understanding the complex interplay between food systems, household income, and nutritional outcomes, informing targeted interventions and social safety nets to address malnutrition and food insecurity among vulnerable populations.

Empirical research in accounting and economics can also help quantify the economic costs of hunger and malnutrition, including productivity losses, healthcare expenditures, and diminished human capital development. These estimates can strengthen the business case for investing in sustainable agriculture and food systems, as well as highlight the long-term economic benefits of achieving SDG 2.

Additionally, the role of innovation and technology in sustainable agriculture cannot be overlooked. Accounting and economic analyses can evaluate the costs, benefits, and adoption barriers of agricultural innovations, such as precision farming techniques, drought-resistant crop varieties, and sustainable irrigation systems. By understanding the economic drivers and incentives for adopting these technologies, policymakers and stakeholders can design targeted interventions to accelerate their adoption and facilitate the transition towards more sustainable and productive agricultural practices.

In conclusion, the Journal of Accounting and Economics has a crucial role to play in advancing the understanding and implementation of SDG 2. Through rigorous research, empirical analyses, and interdisciplinary collaborations, the journal can contribute to the development of accounting frameworks, economic models, and policy recommendations that support sustainable agriculture, food security, and the eradication of hunger. By bridging the gap between theory and practice, the journal can provide valuable insights to policymakers, businesses, and stakeholders, enabling them to make informed decisions and drive progress towards this vital global goal.
