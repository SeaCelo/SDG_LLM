In the Context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Chile's International Cooperation Agency (AGCID) Role in Advancing SDG 2

As part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Chileâ€™s International Cooperation Agency (AGCID) has taken a leading role in advancing Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2): "End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture." This goal embodies one of the greatest global challenges, which Chile faces despite significant progress in reducing hunger and malnutrition.

Our analysis reveals that, while Chile has significantly reduced the prevalence of malnutrition, pockets of food insecurity persist, particularly in rural areas and among indigenous communities. Additionally, access to healthy and nutritious food remains a challenge for large segments of the population, reflected in high rates of obesity and diet-related chronic diseases.

In this context, AGCID has implemented a multidimensional strategy that addresses both food security and the promotion of sustainable agri-food systems. This includes technical and financial cooperation with partner countries, the exchange of best practices, and the strengthening of local capacities.

A key aspect of our work has been promoting family farming and food sovereignty, recognizing the critical role of small-scale farmers in food provision and ecosystem preservation. In this regard, we have supported initiatives in agroecology, efficient irrigation systems, and the preservation of traditional crops and agricultural practices, especially within indigenous communities.

We have also driven the implementation of public policies aimed at improving the nutritional quality of food and promoting healthy eating habits. This includes regulating the advertising of unhealthy foods, nutritional labeling, and promoting food education in schools and communities.

However, we recognize that persistent challenges require an integrated and coordinated approach at both national and international levels. Consequently, we have strengthened our partnerships with multilateral organizations, civil society organizations, and the private sector to pool efforts and resources towards achieving SDG 2.

In this regard, AGCID has played a key role in coordinating a regional strategy for food security and nutrition in Latin America and the Caribbean. This initiative seeks to address shared regional challenges, fostering South-South cooperation and the exchange of successful knowledge and experiences.

Additionally, we have promoted the inclusion of cross-cutting approaches in our interventions, such as gender equality, the empowerment of rural women, and the protection of indigenous peoples' rights. We recognize that food insecurity and malnutrition disproportionately impact these groups and that their active participation is crucial for achieving SDG 2.

In summary, the path to eradicating hunger and promoting sustainable food systems is complex and multidimensional. However, AGCID has made an unwavering commitment to this goal by coordinating efforts at the national, regional, and global levels and promoting a holistic approach that integrates food security, nutrition, sustainable agriculture, and ecosystem protection.
