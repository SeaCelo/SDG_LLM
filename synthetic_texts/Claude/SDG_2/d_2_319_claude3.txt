Eradicating hunger and achieving food security remain critical global challenges that demand unwavering commitment and innovative strategies. The Directorate-General for International Partnerships recognizes the multidimensional nature of this endeavor and acknowledges the intricate interplay between agriculture, nutrition, and sustainable resource management.

Despite significant progress over the past decades, the world continues to grapple with the scourge of hunger and malnutrition. According to the latest estimates, nearly 690 million people were undernourished in 2019, with the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbating this crisis, pushing an additional 83 to 132 million individuals into chronic hunger. Alarmingly, the prevalence of severe food insecurity has doubled since 2014, disproportionately affecting marginalized communities and conflict-affected regions.

Achieving sustainable food systems is inextricably linked to addressing the root causes of hunger, poverty, and environmental degradation. The global population's relentless growth, coupled with the adverse impacts of climate change, resource depletion, and unsustainable agricultural practices, poses formidable challenges to ensuring food security for all.

To combat these challenges, a holistic and multifaceted approach is imperative. Promoting sustainable agricultural practices, such as agroecological farming techniques, conservation agriculture, and integrated pest management, is crucial to bolstering food production while minimizing environmental impact. Investments in research and development, fostering climate-resilient crops, and enhancing access to agricultural inputs and technologies for smallholder farmers are pivotal.

Furthermore, addressing the systematic marginalization of women in agriculture is a strategic imperative. Women constitute a significant proportion of the agricultural workforce, yet they often face inequitable access to resources, land ownership, and decision-making processes. Empowering women through targeted interventions, such as improving access to credit, extension services, and training, can catalyze transformative change in food security and rural development.

Tackling food loss and waste is another critical front in the battle against hunger. Approximately one-third of the food produced globally is lost or wasted, representing a staggering squandering of resources and a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Improving post-harvest management, fostering efficient supply chains, and promoting sustainable consumption patterns can yield substantial dividends in reducing food waste and enhancing resource efficiency.

Nutrition security is an integral component of SDG 2, as malnutrition in all its forms – undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, and overweight/obesity – poses grave consequences for human health and socioeconomic development. Promoting diverse and nutrient-rich diets, fortifying staple foods, and implementing targeted interventions for vulnerable groups, such as children and pregnant women, are essential to addressing this multifaceted challenge.

Achieving food security and sustainable agriculture also necessitates robust governance frameworks, effective policy coherence, and strong international cooperation. Enhancing access to markets, fostering fair trade practices, and promoting responsible investment in agriculture are critical components of a comprehensive strategy. Additionally, strengthening the resilience of food systems to shocks and stresses, such as conflicts, natural disasters, and economic downturns, is imperative to safeguarding food security in times of crisis.

In conclusion, eradicating hunger and achieving sustainable food systems require a concerted global effort that transcends borders and sectors. By leveraging innovative technologies, fostering inclusive and sustainable agricultural practices, empowering marginalized communities, and promoting robust governance frameworks, we can pave the way for a future where food security is a reality for all, and the intergenerational cycles of poverty and malnutrition are consigned to the annals of history.
