Here is a long academic article about SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), written from the perspective of Shobha De, the renowned Indian writer and social commentator:

The Curse of Hunger in the Land of Spices and Sages

Darlings, hunger is a scourge that continues to afflict large swaths of our beloved nation, a brutish shadow that lurks amidst our gleaming IT parks and posh high-rises. It is a festering wound on the soul of Mother India – one that mocks our pretensions of being a rising superpower even as children's bellies remain distended and malnourished in the bastis just miles from our plush metropolitan enclaves. 

How did we arrive at such a shameful juncture, I ask you? Was not the very premise of Bharat's civilizational awakening rooted in the concept of annadaata – of revering the benevolent provider of our sustaining grains? Have our sages and seers not woven tapestries of wisdom extolling the simple vessels of rice and lentils as blessed amrit – the elixir that fuels our bodies and minds? What foul alchemy has curdled these sacred values into the acrid taint of hunger that now festers all around us?

Make no mistake, my friends – this scourge represents a multidimensional crisis of gargantuan proportions. It is not merely about calorific deficits, but a pernicious zugzwang born of structural inequalities, policy paralysis, and that most accursed of Indian afflictions - the dead weight of apathy towards the suffering masses. Like a metastasizing cancer, hunger lays bare the abject failures of governance that enable eons-old caste hierarchies, gender discrimination, debt bondage, and corporate plundering of the natural commons to persist unchecked. 

Consider the dehumanizing paradox of India's infant nutrition statistics being amongst the world's worst while our food industries churn out mountains of high-calorie snacks for the burgeoning middle-classes. Witness the exodus of impoverished rural folk to urban slums where hunger meets malnutrition in a grim waltz. Marvel at the absurd reality of our farmers – the very annadaatas we once revered – suffering eating disorders while high-yield industrial agri-corporations profiteer with political patronage.     

Make no mistake, my putraas and putris - the path out of this morass will not be paved with mere token welfare schemes and food subsidies that perpetuate a dehumanizing, dole-dependent existence for our poor. We stand at a critical crossroads where incremental measures will no longer suffice. We need a fundamental reordering of societal priorities underpinned by a grand vision of inclusive, sustainable, and ethical food production.

This imperative must be anchored to decisive land reforms that empower the tillers of the soil with secure tenures and access to markets. It demands an overhaul of callous agricultural subsidies benefiting only a pampered elite, in favor of promoting biodiverse and climate-resilient family farming. Indigenous foods and traditional cultivars – guardians of precious nutrition - deserve to be revived via public support, not steamrolled by the Green Revolution's thirst for monocultures. 

We must invest heavily in rural infrastructure, post-harvest technologies, and building efficient farm-to-fork supply chains to reduce obscene levels of food waste. Social protection nets must expand beyond just handouts to provide dignified employment, education, healthcare and financial inclusion. And we need zero tolerance for the depredations of crony capitalists expropriating land, water and forest resources that sustain subsistence livelihoods of the poor.

My conscience also demands that we confront the dark nexus between hunger, ecological despoliation, and climate chaos. As heatwaves scorch the land and droughts descend with increasing fury, how can we accept a system so abhorrently oblivious to its own long-term survival? Our depleted soils, plundered aquifers, poisoned rivers, and smogged cities represent harbingers of a greater catastrophe looming. We stand at an existential juncture where reimagining food systems through the lens of sustainability is not just a question of ethics, but of sheer existential compulsion.

In confronting these manifold challenges, perhaps we could draw inspiration from that greatest of all our annadaatas – the eternal 'Annapurna' herself, the Divine Mother venerated as the Nourisher. Her iconography, emanating abundantly from the subcontinent's agrarian heartlands, depicts her showering the devotee with an overflow of lush grains, herbs and produce from her infinite vase of inexhaustible giving. It is this spirit of magnanimous, nurturing plenitude that we need to revive across our land – a societal renaissance that banishes hunger by first unlocking the shackles of deprivation, inequity and short-sighted greed from the human spirit.  

So I beckon you, my friends, to join this struggle for reclaiming our nation's izzat on the most fundamental planes of food, soil, and ethical sustenance. For only when we have triumphed over the demon of hunger – extinguishing it with the fiery tools of courage, vision and compassion - can we truly awaken to our vaunted destinies as a Vishwa Guru and Jagad Gurus for the world. Hunger is not just deadly abhorrence, it is the cruelest negation of all that is sacred in our civilization's very core. We simply cannot let it endure any longer on the tortured face of Bharat Mata.
