Here is a detailed academic-style article about SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), written from the perspective of controversial British journalist Richard Littlejohn:

Yet More Lefty Dogma to Swallow: The UN's Pie-in-the-Sky Goals for 2030

I'm sure you're all familiar with the latest round of hand-wringing from the sandal-wearers at the United Nations. Their grandiose "Sustainable Development Goals" for 2030 read like a socialist utopian fantasy cooked up over one too many glasses of fair trade organic chardonnay. Among their 17 lofty aims is the highly ambitious "Goal 2: Zero Hunger."

Let me stop you right there before your idealistic middle-class student union brains explode with visions of ending famine worldwide. Even a primary school kid could see the folly in promising to eliminate hunger entirely by 2030. Thanks to good old British common sense, we've long accepted that a certain level of poverty will always exist, no matter how much foreign aid is squandered on corrupt kleptocrats in Bongo Bongo Land.

But these well-meaning liberal namby-pambies couldn't resist the chance to virtue signal by banging on about eradicating hunger and malnutrition once and for all. Do they really expect us to achieve that impossible goal in just over a decade when it's been an insoluble problem since the dawn of humanity?

Their meandering strategy for SDG 2 mentions guff about sustainable agriculture, investment in rural infrastructure, and empowering small farmers. All typical aid agency gobbledygook if you ask me. We've poured billions into those same old schemes for decades with precious little to show for it.

The ideologues prattling on about hunger also harp on incessantly about climate change, resource scarcity, gender equality, and indigenous rights. As if checking those PC boxes will somehow magic food into the bellies of starving children across the Third World. I'm absolutely gobsmacked by this level of naive metropolitan smugness.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not a raging racist dinosaur with a heart of stone. Of course, I want to help feed the world's poor just as much as the next person. But this latest collection of regurgitated UN platitudes does nothing but reveal the utter futility of relying on unaccountable international bureaucrats to solve complex global issues.

Instead of these fantasies about zero hunger, we need hardheaded pragmatic policies based in the real world. Open up those benighted nations to free market capitalism and Western investment. Give their economies a shot of entrepreneurial energy and the latest agricultural technology. Stop propping up tinpot dictators who blunder from one self-inflicted famine to the next.

But no, that would require the UN purists to abandon their pie-in-the-sky dreams and face some harsh realities about the world we actually live in. The bottom line is that zero hunger by 2030 is about as achievable as a pillow fight in a nunnery. Anyone who believes such ridiculous tosh needs their head examining.

Like everything that comes out of that alienated globalist racket, the SDGs are just more hot air and empty rhetoric from out-of-touch liberal elites. At least they've given me a few more column inches to mock their insufferable sermonizing from my cozy suburban armchair. Anyone for another cup of fair trade coffee while we solve hunger and poverty once and for all?
