Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 2: Zero Hunger, written from the perspective of renowned journalist and commentator Leonard Pitts:

Hunger is humanity's oldest and most persistent affliction. In a world of breathtaking abundance and innovation, the fact that hundreds of millions still go to bed hungry every night is an unconscionable paradox – a moral stain on the fabric of our civilization. As we pursue lofty goals of technological ascendancy and cosmic exploration, this brutal reality should hang like a millstone around our collective conscience, reminding us that our highest achievements ring hollow until we first solve the existential crisis in our midst.    

The statistics are as staggering as they are shameful. According to the United Nations, after decades of hard-won progress, the COVID-19 pandemic plunged crisis levels of hunger to their worst point in over a decade, upending lives and jeopardizing the 2030 target of the Second Sustainable Development Goal: Zero Hunger. Nearly 690 million people – 1 in 11 worldwide – suffered from chronic undernourishment in 2019, with projections suggesting the pandemic may have added over 130 million more to these grim rolls in 2020. The visceral tragedy embedded in these raw numbers is almost too much to absorb: millions of children stunted in body and mind, entire populations trapped in inescapable cycles of deprivation, human potential eroded before it can be tapped.

We fool ourselves by characterizing this plight as some far-removed abstraction, a "them" problem relegated to parched sub-Saharan villages and squalid urban slums. This is our shared cross to bear. Hunger does not exist in a vacuum, but rather serves as the prime catalyst for many of the globalized challenges that make a mockery of our vaunted connectedness. It turbochares instability, hastens the onset of conflict, disproportionately impacts women and minorities, sabotages health and education outcomes, and exacerbates the existential threats of climate change through forced displacement and resource strain. Put simply, our failure to ensure all people have reliable access to affordable, nutritious food supplies is the rotten thread that, when pulled, causes the entire tapestry of human development to unravel.    

If these seem like the overwrought ravings of a doomsayer, consider that many eminent global institutions agree that achieving Zero Hunger is not merely a moral imperative, but a strategic and economic necessity if we hope to cultivate peaceful, equitable societies. This is not a selfless charity endeavor, but an act of self-preservation. After all, no nation can truly thrive when its citizens lack the baseline sustenance required to learn, work, and realize their intrinsic potential. Curing systemic hunger is a tide that lifts all boats - boosting GDP, enhancing political stability, fueling innovation and productivity, while sparing incalculable human suffering. The choice is as clear as it is urgent.

What's needed is a bold rethinking of our fragmented, inadequate approaches to food production, distribution, and consumption. We must invest in climate-resilient agricultural practices that sustainably increase crop yields, while mitigating ecological damage. We must embrace public-private partnerships that streamline supply chains and reduce obscene levels of food waste. We must devote resources to empowering smallholder farmers, many of them women, who form the backbone of developing world food systems. We must make nutrition a central pillar of international aid and development agendas. Perhaps most importantly, we must elevate this conversation from the shadows, shining an unforgiving light on the unconscionable reality that in 2023 – a time of such staggering abundance and innovation – people still die of starvation. 

Some may view the goal of Zero Hunger as a utopian fantasy, too lofty and complex to achieve. I see it as the most fundamental, clear-eyed investment we can make to create a better world for all. After all, what could possibly be more vital to human flourishing than ensuring every person, in every nation, has the ability to feed themselves and their families? It is the most basic requirement for health, stability, and productivity – the soil from which all progress grows. It is the issue that reminds us, with moral clarity, that despite our ingenuity and wealth, we remain a deeply imperfect species spinning our wheels until we solve this most primordial challenge. So let us dream big and act boldly to make hunger a relic of history. The future we want is surely hungrier than that.
