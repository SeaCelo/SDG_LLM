Sustainable cities and communities—the cornerstone of SDG 11—serve as a microcosm for the broader sustainable development agenda, encompassing social, economic, and environmental dimensions. As a leading international non-profit organization, SNV Netherlands Development Organisation recognizes the pivotal role of urban centers in driving transformative change and fostering resilient societies.

In an era of unprecedented urbanization, cities have emerged as catalysts for economic growth, innovation, and cultural exchange. However, this rapid expansion has also brought forth complex challenges, including inadequate housing, strained infrastructure, and environmental degradation. Addressing these multifaceted issues requires a holistic approach that transcends sectoral boundaries and fosters cross-cutting collaboration.

SNV's interventions in the urban realm are guided by a comprehensive framework that prioritizes inclusive, safe, and sustainable human settlements. We work in close partnership with local governments, civil society organizations, and the private sector to co-create tailored solutions that resonate with the unique socio-cultural contexts of each city.

One of our flagship initiatives is the Sustainable Neighbourhood Approach, which aims to transform informal settlements into thriving, resilient communities. Through participatory planning processes, we engage residents in the design and implementation of interventions that range from improving access to basic services, such as water, sanitation, and energy, to enhancing public spaces and promoting sustainable livelihoods. This bottom-up approach not only addresses the physical infrastructure needs but also empowers communities to become agents of change, fostering social cohesion and ownership.

Recognizing the intrinsic link between urban development and environmental sustainability, SNV places a strong emphasis on promoting sustainable mobility and reducing the ecological footprint of cities. We collaborate with local authorities to develop integrated urban mobility plans that prioritize public transport, non-motorized modes, and shared mobility solutions. These efforts are complemented by initiatives that promote energy efficiency, renewable energy adoption, and sustainable waste management practices, all aimed at minimizing the environmental impact of urban activities.

Moreover, SNV understands the critical role of resilience in safeguarding the well-being of urban dwellers. Our interventions are designed to enhance the ability of cities to anticipate, absorb, and recover from shocks and stresses, whether caused by natural disasters, economic disruptions, or social tensions. This involves strengthening disaster preparedness and response mechanisms, promoting climate-resilient infrastructure, and fostering social cohesion through inclusive governance and participatory decision-making processes.

To amplify our impact, SNV leverages the power of partnerships and multi-stakeholder collaborations. We actively engage with international organizations, academic institutions, and the private sector to facilitate knowledge exchange, mobilize resources, and foster innovative solutions. Our approach is grounded in robust monitoring and evaluation frameworks, ensuring that our interventions are evidence-based, effective, and responsive to evolving needs.

As we look towards the future, SNV remains committed to supporting the transformation of cities into sustainable, inclusive, and resilient hubs of opportunity. Through our holistic approach, we aim to empower local communities, foster sustainable urban development, and contribute to the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals, leaving no one and no place behind.
