Sustainable and resilient urbanization remains a critical priority as we advance towards 2030. The International Labour Organization (ILO) recognizes the profound impact of SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) on the world of work and the imperative of aligning labor policies with this transformative agenda.

Globally, cities generate over 80% of GDP yet are home to deeply entrenched socioeconomic inequalities, informal employment, and decent work deficits. Rapid urbanization, exacerbated by rural-urban migration and population growth, has outpaced the capacity of many cities to provide adequate housing, infrastructure, and basic services. Consequently, an estimated 1 billion people reside in urban slums and informal settlements, lacking access to safe water, sanitation, and secure land tenure.

The urban informal economy accounts for over 60% of total employment in many developing nations, perpetuating cycles of poverty, vulnerability, and exploitation. Workers in this sector, disproportionately women and migrants, face low wages, hazardous conditions, and lack of social protection or labor rights. Transitioning these workers to the formal economy through integrated policy approaches is imperative for inclusive economic growth and sustainable urban development.

Additionally, cities are major contributors to environmental degradation, consuming over two-thirds of global energy and generating 70% of greenhouse gas emissions. Unchecked urban sprawl, congestion, and pollution pose severe health risks and undermine climate action efforts. Transitioning to resource-efficient, low-carbon cities through green building, public transit, renewable energy, and waste management systems is crucial for environmental sustainability and creating green jobs.

The ILO envisions a future where cities are engines of decent work creation, innovation, and sustainable economic development. We advocate for comprehensive urban policies that prioritize participatory planning, affordable housing, universal access to basic services, and resilient infrastructure adaptive to climate change impacts. Strengthening municipal governance, engaging local communities, and fostering public-private partnerships are vital for effective implementation.

Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of ensuring safe and secure working environments, extending labor protections to informal workers, promoting gender equality, and providing skills development opportunities aligned with the emerging green economy. Initiatives such as the ILO's Decent Work Agenda for Greener Cities and the Turin Process on Fair Migration provide guiding frameworks for integrating labor standards into urban development strategies.

To illustrate, consider the city of Bangalore, India, where the ILO is collaborating with local authorities to formalize the waste-picking sector through cooperatives, providing access to social security, skills training, and improved working conditions. This initiative not only enhances livelihoods but also contributes to sustainable waste management and circular economy goals.

In conclusion, the achievement of SDG 11 is intrinsically linked to the realization of decent work, social inclusion, environmental sustainability, and economic prosperity. The ILO remains committed to supporting member states in developing coherent policies that harness the transformative potential of urbanization while safeguarding workers' rights, promoting gender equality, and fostering sustainable, resilient, and inclusive cities for all.
