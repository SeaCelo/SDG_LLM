Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), written from the perspective of Terence Blacker:

The Concrete Scourge: How Cities Have Become The Blight of Our Age

By Terence Blacker

Once there were villages, towns, the occasional city - places where human ingenuity found its fullest expression in harmonious communities attuned to their natural surroundings. Sadly, that epoch has long been buried under a carcinogenic spread of concrete and steel, a brutal metaphor for mankind's tragic disregard for the delicate balances of our world. The modern city in its voracious, unstoppable growth has become an insult to the order and beauty of the planet itself.

Let's examine the hard evidence. SDG 11, with its lofty aim to "make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable", lays bare the catastrophic effects of unchecked urbanization. Municipal wastelands of pollution, poverty and crime are destroying the lives of billions globally. In the world's megacities, vast swathes of humanity are consigned to hyper-crowded slums without basic sanitation. The wealthy minority, meanwhile, seal themselves in gilded towers, cut off from the airless reality beyond their gates.  

How did such monstrosities come to be the predominant mode of human existence? The creeping menace of urbanization has its roots in the Industrial Revolution, when Dickensian manufacturers began their ruthless exploitation of labor and the environment alike. Ever since, a desolate cycle has raged - machines and factories have facilitated senseless, anarchic growth, with cities expanding to house the wretched workforce that feeds them. 

The data make harrowing reading. Over half the world's population now resides in cities, which consume two-thirds of energy and account for 70% of human-influenced emissions. Ecological footprints are off the scale - most metropolises gobble resources from far beyond their borders, hoovering up hinterlands many times their own size. Rising sea levels pose an existential risk to coastal cities, not to mention the vulnerability of settlements worldwide to disasters like earthquakes, droughts and pandemics.

Thankfully, pockets of resistance offer slivers of hope. Indigenous and rural communities continue to lead radically sustainable existences, living in tune with the rhythms of the planet. Eco-villages, transition towns and off-grid pioneers are championing models for a decentralized, human-scale way of life. Most critically, many now recognize the need to halt the remorseless expansion of cities by reviving regional hubs, market towns and compact, diverse settlements.

Only when humanity recognizes cities as the parasitic, ecocidal carbuncles they have become can we begin to reverse the damage. Until the day we raze these concrete affronts to the earth and re-embrace ways of living aligned with the divine order of nature, Goal 11 shall remain a utopian fantasy. The unstoppable march of urbanization may seem inevitable - but it is we, not our cities, who must be truly unsustainable.
