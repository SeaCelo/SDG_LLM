The Sustainable Development Goal 11, which aims to "make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable," is a crucial endeavor that demands a multifaceted approach. As the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), we recognize the pivotal role that sustainable urbanization plays in shaping the global development landscape.

Rapid urbanization has been a defining characteristic of our contemporary world, with over 55% of the global population residing in cities as of 2018. This trend is projected to intensify, with nearly 70% of the world's population expected to live in urban areas by 2050. While cities are engines of economic growth and innovation, they also face significant challenges, including inadequate housing, strained infrastructure, poor air quality, and limited access to basic services.

MIGA's approach to SDG 11 is underpinned by a holistic understanding of the intricate interplay between urban development, environmental sustainability, and socioeconomic inclusivity. We recognize that achieving sustainable cities requires a delicate balance between promoting economic growth, preserving natural resources, and ensuring equitable access to opportunities and services for all segments of the population.

Our investment guarantees and risk mitigation instruments play a crucial role in catalyzing private sector investment in sustainable urban development projects. By providing political risk insurance and credit enhancement products, we help mitigate risks and create an enabling environment for investors, thereby unlocking capital flows into critical infrastructure projects, affordable housing initiatives, and sustainable transportation systems.

One of our flagship initiatives is the "Urban Resilience Program," which aims to bolster the capacity of cities to withstand and recover from shocks and stresses, such as natural disasters, climate change impacts, and economic disruptions. Through this program, we collaborate with local governments, private sector partners, and civil society organizations to develop comprehensive risk assessment frameworks, implement resilient infrastructure solutions, and promote disaster preparedness and response strategies.

For instance, in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake that struck Mexico City in 2017, MIGA provided political risk insurance to support the reconstruction and retrofitting of critical infrastructure, including hospitals, schools, and transportation networks. Our involvement not only facilitated the inflow of much-needed private capital but also ensured that the rebuilt infrastructure adhered to the highest standards of resilience and sustainability.

Another key area of focus for MIGA is the promotion of inclusive and affordable housing solutions. We recognize that access to adequate and affordable housing is a fundamental human right and a crucial component of sustainable urban development. Through our partnerships with developers, financial institutions, and housing finance agencies, we support the construction and financing of affordable housing projects, ensuring that low-income and marginalized communities have access to safe and secure living conditions.

In one such project in India, MIGA provided political risk insurance to a leading affordable housing developer, enabling the construction of over 10,000 affordable housing units across multiple cities. This project not only addressed the pressing need for affordable housing but also incorporated sustainable design principles, such as energy-efficient construction materials and on-site renewable energy generation, thereby reducing the environmental footprint of these developments.

Moreover, MIGA is at the forefront of promoting sustainable transportation solutions in urban areas. We recognize that efficient and environmentally friendly transportation systems are crucial for reducing air pollution, mitigating traffic congestion, and enhancing mobility and connectivity within cities. Through our partnerships with private sector operators, we support the development and expansion of public transportation networks, including Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems, light rail projects, and electric vehicle infrastructure.

In Colombia, for instance, MIGA provided political risk insurance to a private operator for the construction and operation of a BRT system in Bogot√°. This project not only enhanced the city's public transportation network but also contributed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality, aligning with the broader goals of sustainability and environmental protection.

Furthermore, MIGA is committed to promoting inclusive and participatory urban governance mechanisms. We recognize that sustainable urban development cannot be achieved without the active engagement and participation of local communities, civil society organizations, and marginalized groups. Through our technical assistance programs and advisory services, we support capacity-building initiatives for local authorities, fostering inclusive decision-making processes, and promoting the integration of diverse stakeholder perspectives in urban planning and policy formulation.

In this vein, we have partnered with municipalities in several countries to establish participatory budgeting processes, which empower citizens to directly influence the allocation of municipal resources and prioritize development projects that align with their needs and aspirations. This approach not only enhances transparency and accountability but also fosters a sense of ownership and shared responsibility among citizens, promoting long-term sustainability and resilience.

As we look towards the future, MIGA remains steadfast in its commitment to supporting the achievement of SDG 11 and fostering sustainable urban development globally. We recognize that cities are not only engines of growth but also crucibles of innovation and catalysts for social and environmental change. By leveraging our expertise in risk mitigation, private sector mobilization, and multistakeholder collaboration, we strive to create an enabling environment for investment in sustainable urban infrastructure, affordable housing, and resilient communities.

Ultimately, our goal is to ensure that cities of the future are not merely centers of economic activity but vibrant, inclusive, and sustainable hubs that foster human well-being, environmental stewardship, and shared prosperity for all.
