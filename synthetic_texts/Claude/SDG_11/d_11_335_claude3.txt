Esteemed colleagues and distinguished members of the global policy community,

The Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11), which aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable, stands as a critical imperative for our collective future. As the world continues to urbanize at an unprecedented rate, the challenges posed by rapid urbanization demand innovative and transformative solutions.

At the crux of SDG 11 lies the recognition that sustainable urban development is inextricably linked to economic prosperity, social inclusion, and environmental sustainability. Cities are engines of growth, catalyzing innovation, driving economic activity, and fostering cultural exchange. However, unplanned and haphazard urbanization has led to a myriad of challenges, including inadequate housing, insufficient infrastructure, urban sprawl, and environmental degradation.

To address these multifaceted challenges, a holistic and integrated approach is paramount. SDG 11 calls for the adoption of participatory, inclusive, and integrated policies and plans that promote resource efficiency, mitigate and adapt to climate change, reduce disaster risk, and safeguard cultural and natural heritage. Achieving this objective necessitates a paradigm shift in urban planning and governance, one that prioritizes sustainable land use, efficient transportation systems, and the provision of adequate, safe, and affordable housing for all.

The role of urban resilience in the face of climate change and natural disasters cannot be overstated. As cities continue to grow, their vulnerability to the impacts of climate change, such as sea-level rise, extreme weather events, and environmental degradation, increases exponentially. SDG 11 emphasizes the importance of strengthening resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters, through the implementation of integrated policies and plans that promote risk reduction, early warning systems, and sustainable resource management.

Furthermore, the pursuit of inclusive and accessible cities is a cornerstone of SDG 11. Ensuring access to safe, inclusive, and accessible public spaces, particularly for women, children, older persons, and persons with disabilities, is crucial for fostering social cohesion, promoting cultural exchange, and enhancing overall well-being. By prioritizing inclusive urban planning and design, we can create vibrant, diverse, and thriving communities that celebrate diversity and promote social integration.

It is important to recognize that the successful implementation of SDG 11 is intrinsically linked to other Sustainable Development Goals, such as SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure), and SDG 13 (climate action). This interconnectedness underscores the need for a systems-based approach that recognizes the synergies and trade-offs between various development objectives.

To illustrate the multifaceted nature of SDG 11, consider the case of Medellin, Colombia, a city once plagued by violence, poverty, and urban decay. Through a comprehensive urban transformation strategy, Medellin has emerged as a global exemplar of sustainable and inclusive urban development. By investing in public transportation, social housing, and public spaces, the city has fostered social inclusion, reduced spatial segregation, and enhanced access to essential services for marginalized communities. The iconic outdoor escalators and cable cars connecting informal settlements to the city center have not only improved mobility but also symbolized the city's commitment to bridging social and economic divides.
