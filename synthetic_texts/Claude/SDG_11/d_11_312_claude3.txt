Thank you for the opportunity to prepare an analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11) - Sustainable Cities and Communities. The Brazilian Cooperation Agency recognizes the fundamental importance of this goal in building a more sustainable and inclusive future for all.

SDG 11 aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. This is particularly relevant in Brazil, where more than 84% of the population lives in urban areas, according to World Bank data. Our cities face complex challenges, including unregulated urban expansion, inadequate infrastructure, mobility issues, environmental pollution, a lack of affordable housing, and vulnerability to natural disasters and climate change.

Addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted and integrated approach. First, it is essential to promote participatory urban planning and the integrated management of human settlements. This involves the active participation of all stakeholders, including governments, the private sector, civil society, and local communities, in decision-making processes concerning urban development. Projects such as the Entrepreneurial City Program, implemented in partnership with the Brazilian Service for Support to Micro and Small Enterprises (Sebrae), are promising examples of how to actively involve local communities in planning and revitalizing urban areas.

Another crucial aspect is the provision of adequate and affordable housing for all. Brazil faces a significant housing deficit, particularly among low-income populations. Programs like Minha Casa, Minha Vida have helped reduce this deficit, but much remains to be done. Exploring new approaches, such as sustainable social housing that integrates ecological design, energy efficiency, and social inclusion, is essential.

Sustainable urban mobility is another key pillar of SDG 11. We must invest in efficient, accessible, and environmentally friendly public transport systems, such as Curitibaâ€™s internationally recognized Urban Mobility System. Promoting non-motorized modes of transportation, such as walking and cycling, and encouraging the adoption of electric vehicles and other clean technologies are also crucial.

Urban resilience is another critical aspect. Our cities must be able to withstand and recover quickly from shocks and disasters, whether natural or man-made. This involves implementing disaster risk reduction measures, such as early warning systems, resilient infrastructure, and risk-sensitive urban planning. Initiatives like the Rio de Janeiro Contingency Plan for Risk Areas are notable examples of addressing this issue.

Additionally, protecting and valuing the cultural and natural heritage of cities is fundamental. Brazil is rich in cultural and environmental diversity, and we must preserve and promote this wealth in our urban areas. Projects such as the Monumenta Program, aimed at preserving historical and cultural heritage, and the Urban Afforestation Program, which encourages the creation and maintenance of green spaces in cities, are commendable initiatives in this regard.

Finally, strengthening partnerships and international cooperation for sustainable urban development is essential. Sharing knowledge, technologies, and best practices among countries, cities, and international organizations is critical to addressing global urban challenges. The Brazilian Cooperation Agency is committed to promoting these collaborations, such as its partnership with the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) and participation in the New Urban Agenda adopted at the United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III) in 2016.

In summary, SDG 11 represents a complex challenge but also an opportunity to build a more sustainable, resilient, and inclusive future for our cities and communities. A comprehensive and collaborative approach involving all sectors of society is necessary to achieve this ambitious goal. The Brazilian Cooperation Agency is committed to contributing to this effort by fostering partnerships, sharing knowledge, and implementing innovative initiatives that can serve as models for other cities and countries.
