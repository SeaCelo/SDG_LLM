Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11), which aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable, is a vital component of the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. As a leading agency in international development, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) recognizes the urgency of addressing the challenges posed by rapid urbanization and the need for comprehensive strategies to promote sustainable urban development.

Urbanization is a global phenomenon, with 55% of the world's population currently residing in urban areas, a figure projected to increase to 68% by 2050. This rapid growth has led to numerous challenges, including inadequate housing, strained infrastructure, increased pollution, and limited access to basic services. Furthermore, urbanization exacerbates existing socioeconomic inequalities, with marginalized communities often bearing the brunt of these challenges.

USAID's approach to SDG 11 is multifaceted, recognizing the interconnectedness of urban development with other SDGs, such as poverty alleviation, climate action, and gender equality. One of the agency's priorities is promoting inclusive and participatory urban planning processes that involve all stakeholders, including local communities, civil society organizations, and the private sector. By fostering collaborative decision-making, USAID aims to ensure that urban development initiatives address the diverse needs and priorities of urban residents, particularly those from vulnerable and marginalized groups.

Access to adequate, safe, and affordable housing is a fundamental component of sustainable urban development. USAID supports initiatives that address the global housing crisis through innovative financing mechanisms, public-private partnerships, and the promotion of sustainable building materials and techniques. These efforts not only provide shelter but also contribute to economic development, job creation, and environmental sustainability.

Resilient infrastructure is crucial for ensuring the long-term viability and functionality of urban areas. USAID collaborates with local governments and stakeholders to develop robust and climate-resilient infrastructure systems, including transportation networks, water and sanitation facilities, and energy grids. These initiatives prioritize the use of renewable energy sources, resource efficiency, and sustainable construction practices, aligning with the agency's broader commitments to combating climate change and promoting environmental stewardship.

Urban mobility is another critical aspect of SDG 11, as efficient and accessible transportation systems are essential for economic growth, social inclusion, and environmental sustainability. USAID supports the development of integrated and multimodal transportation solutions, such as public transit systems, pedestrian and cycling infrastructure, and intelligent transportation systems. These initiatives aim to reduce congestion, improve air quality, and enhance accessibility for all urban residents, including those with disabilities and limited mobility.

Recognizing the disproportionate impact of environmental degradation and natural disasters on urban areas, USAID prioritizes efforts to enhance urban resilience. This includes supporting disaster risk reduction strategies, promoting green infrastructure solutions, and fostering community-based adaptation and mitigation measures. By strengthening the capacity of local governments and communities to anticipate and respond to environmental and climatic challenges, USAID aims to build more resilient and adaptable urban environments.

Preserving and promoting cultural heritage is an integral part of USAID's work in urban development. The agency supports initiatives that safeguard tangible and intangible cultural assets, promoting their sustainable management and integration into urban planning processes. By recognizing the significance of cultural heritage, USAID contributes to the preservation of diverse identities, fosters social cohesion, and promotes sustainable tourism opportunities.
