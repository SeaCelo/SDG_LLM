Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), written from the perspective of Polly Toynbee:

Our cities have become the great crucibles of the modern era, monuments to human ingenuity and cooperation, yet also vectors for many of our greatest societal afflictions. As our urban areas swell, bursting with the hopes and toils of those seeking opportunity, they strain under the weight of overcrowding, inadequate housing, crippling inequality, unchecked pollution, and crumbling infrastructure. The Sustainable Development Goal of creating inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable cities is thus a pivotal imperative if we are to construct the equitable, thriving communities that our ideals demand.

The bitter truth is that too many of our cities have been shaped by the malign forces of unrestrained capitalism and systematic injustice. For the working poor and ethnic minorities, the urban landscape is an obstacle course of disinvestment, displacement, and despair. The blight of ramshackle slums and fragmented public services attests to our moral failure to share the fruits of human progress. From London's appalling Grenfell Tower tragedy to the choking smog shrouding Delhi, our cities reveal the unsightly scars of rampant inequality and shortsighted governance.  

Yet there is also cause for guarded optimism. Around the world, enlightened municipal leaders and engaged citizens are demonstrating that a different urban paradigm is possible. Initiatives like affordable housing development and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure revitalization are transforming once blighted areas into thriving communities of opportunity. Cities like Copenhagen, with its robust cycling networks and renewable district heating systems, exemplify how environmental sustainability and quality of life can be symbiotic. And the participatory budgeting movements pioneered in Porto Alegre show how empowering the historically marginalized to shape civic priorities can forge cities that are truly for the people.

Still, these uplifting pockets of progress are eclipsed by the sheer scale of the challenge before us. By 2050, two-thirds of humanity will reside in cities, testing our ability to build affordable housing, reliable transit, green spaces, and resilient infrastructure on an unprecedented scale. The existential threat of climate change could render many coastal megacities uninhabitable through rising sea levels and intensifying natural disasters. And bitter inequality stalks our urban landscapes like a vampire, with staggering divides in wealth, health, and access fraying the social fabric.

To meet this manifest crisis, we must rekindle the embers of social democracy and construct cities as beacons of egalitarian prosperity, not reinforced redoubts of privilege. Massive public investments in green housing initiatives, zero-emissions transit networks, and renewable urban power grids must be regarded as economic imperatives, not expendable indulgences. Mixed-income communities and stringent inclusionary zoning must replace the socioeconomic apartheid that scars so many city boundaries. Participatory planning that amplifies the voices of the marginalized must become the DNA of urban development. 

Underpinning all of this must be a fundamental reconceptualization of cities not as cash cows for real estate speculation and privatized profiteering, but as democratized commonwealths in service of the greater social good. The unconscionable realities of homelessness and crumbling public schools in the shadows of gleaming million-dollar condos remind us that our cities have been debased into sources of predatory extraction rather than vehicles of human flourishing. We must urbanize, but not at the cost of our souls.

Our cities were conceived to elevate the human experience, to accelerate innovation and cross-pollinate ideas across diverse cultures. To fulfill that promise requires reclaiming them as crucibles of equitable dynamism and sustainable progress. For those imprisoned by the privations of urban destitution, the ramparts of injustice can seem impregnable. But the liberation movements of history have shown that even the mightiest bastions of oppression are inherently vulnerable to the battering rams of collective solidarity and moral urgency. By mustering the courage of our convictions, we can yet redeem the noble vision of cities as arenas of emancipation and renewal, turning the concrete canyons into soaring monuments to the boundless potential of our common humanity.
