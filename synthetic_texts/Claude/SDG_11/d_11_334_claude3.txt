The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, through Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11), has set an ambitious target to "make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable." This goal recognizes the vital role that urban areas play in driving economic growth, social development, and environmental sustainability. As the world continues to urbanize at an unprecedented rate, addressing the challenges and leveraging the opportunities presented by cities and human settlements has become a global imperative.

In Mexico, the Mexican Agency for International Development Cooperation (AMEXCID) has been at the forefront of efforts to promote sustainable urban development and localize the SDGs. Through strategic partnerships, innovative financing mechanisms, and capacity-building initiatives, AMEXCID has been working tirelessly to support municipalities and local communities in their quest to create inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities.

One of the key focus areas for AMEXCID has been promoting access to adequate, safe, and affordable housing and basic services for all, as outlined in target 11.1 of the SDGs. In collaboration with the National Housing Commission (CONAVI), AMEXCID has been facilitating the construction of low-cost, eco-friendly housing units in urban areas, particularly for marginalized communities. These initiatives have not only provided shelter but have also incorporated sustainable design principles, such as energy-efficient construction materials and renewable energy sources, reducing the environmental footprint of these settlements.

Furthermore, AMEXCID has been at the forefront of efforts to improve urban planning and management, as stipulated in target 11.3. By working closely with municipal authorities, AMEXCID has supported the development of integrated urban development plans that prioritize sustainable land use, efficient public transportation systems, and the preservation of cultural and natural heritage. These efforts have been particularly crucial in rapidly growing urban centers, where unplanned expansion often leads to sprawl, environmental degradation, and social inequalities.

In recognition of the disproportionate impact of climate change and natural disasters on urban areas, AMEXCID has also been a driving force in enhancing urban resilience, as outlined in target 11.b. Through capacity-building programs and knowledge-sharing platforms, AMEXCID has been equipping local authorities and communities with the tools and strategies needed to develop and implement disaster risk reduction strategies, early warning systems, and climate change adaptation measures. These efforts have been particularly crucial in coastal cities and regions prone to natural hazards, such as hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes.

One of the innovative approaches adopted by AMEXCID has been the promotion of participatory urban governance, as envisioned in target 11.3. By actively engaging local communities, civil society organizations, and the private sector in urban planning and decision-making processes, AMEXCID has fostered a sense of ownership and accountability among stakeholders. This collaborative approach has not only led to more inclusive and representative urban policies but has also facilitated the co-creation of solutions tailored to the unique needs and challenges of each community.

AMEXCID's efforts have also extended to the realm of sustainable transportation, as outlined in target 11.2. In partnership with the Ministry of Communications and Transportation (SCT), AMEXCID has supported the development of sustainable urban mobility plans that prioritize public transportation, non-motorized modes of transport, and the integration of land-use and transportation planning. These initiatives have not only aimed to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution but have also sought to enhance accessibility and connectivity for all residents, particularly those in underserved and marginalized communities.

Moreover, AMEXCID has been a strong advocate for the protection and safeguarding of the world's cultural and natural heritage, as emphasized in target 11.4. Through partnerships with organizations such as the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) and the National Commission for Natural Protected Areas (CONANP), AMEXCID has supported the preservation and sustainable management of urban heritage sites, including historic city centers, archaeological sites, and urban green spaces. These efforts have not only sought to conserve Mexico's rich cultural and natural heritage but have also aimed to promote sustainable tourism and economic development opportunities for local communities.

One of the most innovative aspects of AMEXCID's approach has been the integration of SDG 11 with other Sustainable Development Goals, recognizing the interconnected nature of the 2030 Agenda. For instance, AMEXCID has worked closely with the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT) to promote sustainable consumption and production patterns in urban areas, as outlined in SDG 12. This has involved initiatives such as promoting waste reduction, recycling, and the circular economy, as well as encouraging the adoption of sustainable building practices and green infrastructure.

Furthermore, AMEXCID has been a strong advocate for gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls in urban areas, as highlighted in SDG 5. Through capacity-building programs and targeted interventions, AMEXCID has sought to enhance women's participation in urban planning and decision-making processes, promote their economic empowerment through entrepreneurship and skills development initiatives, and ensure their safety and security in public spaces.

In conclusion, AMEXCID's efforts towards achieving SDG 11 have been comprehensive, innovative, and deeply rooted in the principles of sustainable development. By fostering strong partnerships, leveraging innovative financing mechanisms, and promoting participatory governance, AMEXCID has been at the forefront of efforts to create inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities and human settlements in Mexico and beyond. However, the challenges posed by rapid urbanization, climate change, and social inequalities remain daunting, and continued commitment, collaboration, and investment will be essential to ensure that no one and no city is left behind in the quest for sustainable development.
