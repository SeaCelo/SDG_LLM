The Sustainable Sanitation Alliance presents this analytical report on SDG 11 – Sustainable Cities and Communities, with a focus on the pivotal role of sanitation in the pursuit of this global objective. Urbanization is an irreversible trend, with projections indicating that nearly 70% of the world's population will reside in cities by 2050. This unprecedented urban growth poses significant challenges, particularly in developing nations, where the influx of people outpaces the capacity to provide essential services, including adequate sanitation facilities.

Sanitation is a fundamental human right and a critical component of sustainable urban development. The lack of access to safe, hygienic, and reliable sanitation services has far-reaching consequences, exacerbating public health risks, perpetuating the cycle of poverty, and undermining progress towards a more equitable and resilient society. Alarmingly, over 2 billion people worldwide lack access to basic sanitation facilities, with a disproportionate burden borne by marginalized communities in urban slums and informal settlements.

Addressing the sanitation crisis is pivotal to achieving SDG 11's target of ensuring universal access to safe, inclusive, and accessible green and public spaces, particularly for women, children, older persons, and persons with disabilities. Without proper sanitation infrastructure, public spaces become breeding grounds for disease, compromising the health and well-being of vulnerable populations. Moreover, the lack of safe and dignified sanitation facilities in schools, workplaces, and public areas perpetuates gender inequalities, as women and girls are often forced to risk their safety and dignity to meet their basic needs.

Sustainable sanitation solutions must be at the forefront of urban planning and development strategies. This necessitates a shift towards decentralized and innovative approaches that prioritize resource recovery, water reuse, and the circular economy. By embracing technologies such as constructed wetlands, anaerobic digestion, and nutrient recovery systems, cities can transform waste into valuable resources, reduce environmental pollution, and generate revenue streams to support the expansion of sanitation services.

Furthermore, the integration of sanitation infrastructure with other urban systems, such as water supply, energy, and solid waste management, is crucial for achieving resource efficiency and promoting synergies that contribute to the overall sustainability of cities. This holistic approach aligns with SDG 11's target of reducing the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality, municipal and other waste management.

Sanitation initiatives must also prioritize community engagement and inclusive decision-making processes. By involving local stakeholders, particularly marginalized groups, in the planning, implementation, and maintenance of sanitation facilities, cities can foster a sense of ownership, ensure cultural appropriateness, and enhance the long-term sustainability of interventions. This participatory approach resonates with SDG 11's target of enhancing inclusive and sustainable urbanization, as well as strengthening efforts to protect and safeguard the world's cultural and natural heritage.

Achieving sustainable sanitation in cities requires unprecedented collaboration among governments, private sector entities, civil society organizations, and international development partners. Innovative financing mechanisms, such as public-private partnerships, blended finance, and targeted subsidies, must be explored to bridge the funding gap and accelerate the deployment of sanitation solutions at scale. Additionally, capacity-building efforts are crucial to empower local authorities, service providers, and communities with the necessary skills and knowledge to effectively plan, operate, and maintain sustainable sanitation systems.

In conclusion, the pursuit of SDG 11 – Sustainable Cities and Communities – is inextricably linked to the provision of safe, accessible, and sustainable sanitation services. By prioritizing sanitation as a cornerstone of urban development strategies, cities can unlock numerous co-benefits, including improved public health, enhanced environmental quality, economic opportunities, and greater social equity. The path towards sustainable urbanization requires a paradigm shift in our approach to sanitation, embracing innovative solutions, fostering cross-sectoral collaboration, and empowering local communities to drive change from the ground up.
