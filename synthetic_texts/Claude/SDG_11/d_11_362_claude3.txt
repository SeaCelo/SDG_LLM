Eurasian Development Bank's Analytical Report on Sustainable Development Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

The Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11), which aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable, is of paramount importance to the Eurasian region. The region's rapid urbanization, driven by economic growth and population movements, has brought forth significant challenges that demand innovative and sustainable solutions.

One of the key priorities for the Eurasian region is addressing the issue of informal settlements and slum-like conditions. Many cities in the region are grappling with the influx of rural-urban migrants, leading to the proliferation of informal settlements lacking basic amenities and infrastructure. This not only perpetuates poverty and social exclusion but also poses severe environmental and public health risks. To tackle this challenge, a multi-faceted approach is required, encompassing urban planning, affordable housing initiatives, and the integration of informal settlements into the formal urban fabric.

Another critical area of focus is the development of sustainable and resilient urban infrastructure. Many Eurasian cities are grappling with aging and overburdened infrastructure systems, exacerbated by rapid urbanization and climate change impacts. Investing in modern, energy-efficient, and climate-resilient infrastructure is crucial for ensuring the long-term sustainability and livability of these cities. This includes exploring innovative solutions such as smart city technologies, renewable energy sources, and green infrastructure for water management and air quality improvement.

Urban mobility is another pressing concern in the Eurasian region. Many cities are plagued by traffic congestion, inadequate public transportation systems, and poor pedestrian and cycling infrastructure. Addressing these challenges requires a holistic approach that promotes sustainable transportation modes, such as efficient public transit networks, cycling and walking paths, and the integration of electric and low-emission vehicles. Effective urban planning and land-use policies that prioritize compact, mixed-use development can also play a crucial role in reducing the need for motorized travel and promoting walkable communities.

Ensuring access to adequate, safe, and affordable housing is a critical component of SDG 11 and a pressing challenge in the Eurasian region. Rising urbanization, coupled with limited housing supply and affordability issues, has led to a housing crisis in many cities. Innovative solutions such as public-private partnerships, rent-to-own schemes, and the promotion of affordable housing through incentives and regulatory frameworks are needed to address this challenge. Additionally, ensuring housing quality, energy efficiency, and resilience to natural disasters is crucial for creating sustainable and livable communities.

Preserving and promoting cultural and natural heritage is another important aspect of SDG 11 that resonates with the rich cultural diversity and natural landscapes of the Eurasian region. Many cities in the region boast significant historical and cultural assets, which not only contribute to their unique identities but also serve as economic drivers through tourism and creative industries. Striking a balance between urban development and heritage preservation is crucial, requiring comprehensive urban planning strategies, community engagement, and sustainable tourism management practices.

Lastly, ensuring inclusive and participatory urban governance is essential for achieving SDG 11 in the Eurasian region. Effective urban governance requires collaboration among various stakeholders, including local authorities, civil society organizations, private sector entities, and citizens themselves. Fostering public participation, transparency, and accountability in urban planning and decision-making processes can help ensure that development efforts are inclusive, equitable, and responsive to the needs of diverse urban communities.
