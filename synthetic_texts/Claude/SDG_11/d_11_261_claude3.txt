Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), written from the perspective of economist and theorist Michael C. Jensen:

The creation of sustainable, resilient cities and human settlements is undoubtedly one of the greatest challenges we face in promoting equitable and sustainable economic development. As an economist, I am keenly aware that the choices we make in regards to urbanization will have profound implications for value creation, environmental impact, social systems, and quality of life for billions worldwide.  

At the core, the issue revolves around agency problems - the tensions that arise when the incentives of various stakeholders in the urbanization process are misaligned. Municipal governments, urban planners, developers, residents, and businesses often have conflicting motivations. This can lead to inefficient allocation of resources, negative externalities like pollution and overcrowding, and a failure to properly address critical long-term needs.

We must realign these incentives through revised governance mechanisms and remuneration policies that encourage decision-useful transparency and accountability. City leaders should be beholden not just to current residents, but to the interests of future generations as well. Developers must internalize the full societal costs of their projects. And citizen representation must extend beyond property owners to include disenfranchised urban poor and transient populations.

This will require innovations in areas like urban benefit corporation laws, contingent contracting, and index-linked transferrable development rights. We should explore policies like linear location pricing, mobility pricing for transit networks, and land value capture mechanisms to better distribute the costs and rewards of urbanization. Human settlement rights could be redefined using automated coordination models and blockchain smart contracts.

Urbanization done right can be an extraordinary value creation opportunity by agglomerating human capital, innovation, economic activity, and access to opportunity. But it requires exquisite systems design to avoid the conflicts of interest that have plagued development efforts throughout history.

Consider the groundbreaking Urban Wealth Funds being piloted in cities like Denver, Toronto and Johannesburg. These funds entitle every local resident to an equal share of the upside from urban growth - creating powerful incentives for inclusive, sustainable development policies. By aligning all stakeholders around value maximization, these funds can overcome bureaucratic inertia and NIMBY obstructionism while empowering citizens as urban 'shareholders.'

The business case for investing in resilient housing, infrastructure, and amenities for the swelling urban poor is also quite compelling from a value creation perspective. Research shows that reducing slum conditions through affordable housing provision, efficient public transit, basic utilities, and livelihood opportunities can boost GDP by an estimated 20-30% annually in developing economies. The spillover effects on health, education and social outcomes amplify these gains considerably.

Of course, challenges around financing, governance, land rights, inequality, and environmental management remain daunting. But we must treat sustainable urbanization as an epic exercise in getting the incentives right - one that will require entrepreneurial genius and society's full creative energies to solve. The future of humanity as a prosperous, flourishing species depends on getting this right.
