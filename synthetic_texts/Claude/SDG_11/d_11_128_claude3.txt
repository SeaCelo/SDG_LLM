Here is a detailed academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), written from the perspective of satirist and columnist Richard Littlejohn:

"Are you sitting comfortably? Then I'll begin. Today's lecture is all about SDG 11 - making our cities more sustainable and less of a blasted inconvenience for hard-working folks just trying to go about their daily business. 

First, let's get one thing straight - I'm no tree-hugging, mung bean-munching eco-loon. I drive a petrol guzzler, holidays in Aya Napa twice a year, and leave every light on in my house just to annoy the energy companies. But even I can see that our cities have become cramped, congested hellholes that are no fit place for decent people.

Just look at the evidence, for Pete's sake. Cities are where most of the world's population clusters these days, like sweaty lemmings packed into Tube carriages at rush hour. No wonder a steadily growing percentage are considered slum dwellers, living in squalid conditions that Oxfam wouldn't allow even for Comic Relief photo-ops. 

Air pollution alone should have the right-on militant cyclists of Islington whooping for joy. Instead of cleanly burning carbon into the atmosphere, city-dwellers now have to inhale concentrated particles, toxins, and whatever-other-filth spews out of their neighbors' rubbish bins each week. It's enough to bring on a full-body horripilation.

Then we come to the traffic problems. Zebra crossings, cycle lanes, windy bus routes - it's a marvel anybody gets anywhere at all these days without being flattened by an Uber driver or mowed down by a hipster on a Boris bike. Haven't these people heard of the Green Cross Code? Sort it out, for pity's sake.

Affordable housing, you ask? Don't get me started. First-time buyers haven't got a cat in hell's chance of getting on the property ladder thanks to over-development, Not In My Back Yard-ism, and all the Eastern Europeans taking all the homes. A new apartment in London costs more than the GDP of the Falkland Islands. What is the world coming to?

But don't worry, there is a solution - and it doesn't involve masks, carbon taxes, or knitting your own mung bean shawls. We simply need to start over with a new model of the compact city. Out with overpriced shoebox flats and in with plenty of suburban green belt land for affordable, decent family homes. Plus bypasses, ring roads, and none of those ludicrous low traffic neighborhoods to turn the ability to drive into an extreme sport. 

While we're at it, this sustainable communities lark means giving people a real sense of investment and belonging. Kick out the buy-to-let brigade pricing out hard-working renters. Stop parachuting in people from anywhere with a few quid to burn. Bring back old-fashioned community spirit, not this melting pot multicultural nonsense splitting neighborhoods along racial and cultural lines.

There, that's told them. I don't care if it's not quite as the United Nations intended. My vision for sustainable cities and communities is proper British market towns and villages where people look out for each other. Not rat-infested concrete jungles with unaffordable boxes to live in, pollution you can taste, and not an Englishman in sight. You've had the opinion of the decent majority for once - like it or lump it!"
