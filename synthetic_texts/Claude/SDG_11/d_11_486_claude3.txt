Sustainable Cities: Building a Resilient Future for All

By Newsday Editorial Board 

The world is urbanizing at an unprecedented rate, with over half the global population now residing in cities. While urban centers are economic powerhouses driving growth and innovation, they also face monumental challenges. From crumbling infrastructure and affordable housing shortages to traffic gridlock, air pollution, and vulnerability to natural disasters, cities are struggling to keep pace with their expansion.

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 11 aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable by 2030. This ambitious target recognizes that our collective future hinges on how we plan, build, and manage the urban spaces where most of humanity will live and work in the coming decades.

Creating sustainable cities requires a radical rethink of how we design, construct and operate the built environment and transportation systems. We need compact, transit-oriented urban planning that reduces sprawl and car dependency. Buildings must meet the highest standards of energy efficiency, tapping renewable power while increasing resilience to hazards like floods, earthquakes, and extreme heat.

Innovative solutions are emerging, like the net-zero energy community taking shape at Laidian in Taiwan. Designed for 36,000 residents, it features rainwater recycling, pneumatic waste collection, and biogas facilities to transform organic waste into natural gas for residences and vehicles. Solar trees will generate renewable electricity while providing shade for pedestrians.  

Transportation is another crucial piece of the sustainability puzzle. Cities should prioritize walking, cycling and affordable public transit over car travel. London's Ultra-Low Emission Zone, for example, charges a daily fee for older, more polluting vehicles entering the urban core—reducing emissions while raising funds for sustainable transportation.

We must also ensure cities offer adequate affordable housing located near job centers. Mixed-use zoning that permits higher-density residential and commercial development is part of the solution, as are public-private partnerships that incentivize below-market rate units. Cities should furthermore preserve and expand green spaces, parks, and recreational areas accessible to all residents.

Beyond infrastructure and urban design, building sustainable communities requires inclusive governance and participatory planning. Historically marginalized groups—including women, minorities, and lower-income residents—must have a voice in decision-making processes that shape their neighborhoods. Policies should proactively protect the rights of all citizens, regardless of age, gender, disability, race, or economic status.

Cities worldwide are experiencing first-hand the severe impacts of climate change, from coastal flooding and storm surges to heat waves and extreme weather events. Urban communities in developing nations are among the most vulnerable. One key priority must therefore be enhancing the resilience of informal settlements and slums, which house over one billion people yet often lack basic services, adequate housing, and resilient infrastructure.

To safeguard cities against natural disasters, urban planners must take proactive measures—like preserving wetlands, mangroves, and other natural buffers that mitigate storm surges, floods, and sea level rise. Early warning systems, emergency preparedness drills, and resilient infrastructure like permeable roads are vital.

Financing the transition to sustainable cities will require unprecedented public and private investment, on the order of trillions annually worldwide. But the costs of inaction are far greater. The World Bank calculates that climate change, disasters, food insecurity, and other risks could trap over 800 million people in poverty by 2030 in the absence of concerted action.

Fundamentally rethinking how we build and inhabit cities is an immense, necessary undertaking that will unfold over decades. Yet it also brings enormous opportunities—to boost economic competitiveness, mitigate climate risks, enhance public health and quality of life, promote social equity, and create more livable, vibrant, connected communities. The future will be an urban one. The choices we make today will shape that human destiny.
