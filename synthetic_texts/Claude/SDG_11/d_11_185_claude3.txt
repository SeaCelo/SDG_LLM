Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), written from the perspective of political cartoonist and commentator Ted Rall:

Our cities are crumbling - victims of the same corporate greed, short-sighted governance, and systemic inequality that plagues the rest of our dystopian society. As urbanization accelerates and climate change rages, only the willfully blind fail to see the urgent need to reimagine how we design, build, and manage the world's metropolitan areas. 

The core challenge of SDG 11 is addressing the burdens inflicted upon cities by unchecked capitalism and corrupt municipal leadership. Developers run rampant, erecting Manhattan-sized condo skyscrapers that scar skylines and blot out the sun for miles around. Gentrification displaces entire communities in the stampede for fresh living spaces for the affluent. Infrastructure decays as the tax base erodes and the wealthy abscond to private enclaves. The result? Cities that are economically stratified, environmentally despoiled, crime-ridden wastelands.

The rotten status quo represents an abject failure of urban planning. Rather than cultivating "inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable" cities as envisioned by SDG 11, we've created concrete jungles that exacerbate inequality, imperil public health, and accelerate environmental decline.Public transit systems are an overpriced, underfunded disgrace, leaving the poor stranded in transit deserts at the mercy of exploitative ride-share monopolies. Smog blankets the skylines. Impoverished neighborhoods suffocate under concentrated poverty, disinvestment, and police militarization.

Sustainable cities must serve all residents equitably, not just the privileged few. Affordable housing needs to be mandated and constructed at scale, with policies to preempt displacement of existing residents. Green spaces, recreation facilities, and essential services have to be available within walking distance of every home. Public transit requires a total overhaul, with high-capacity electric rail and bicycle-transit integration creating seamless, low-emission mobility networks.

Above all, governance must be elevated from the avaricious clutches of developers, industrial cabals, and corrupt authority to citizen stakeholders invested in cultivating economically and environmentally vibrant communities. City planning needs to be a grassroots exercise in direct democracy, with participatory budgeting and local control over land use and construction.

Until we wrest our urban centers from the vested interests currently pillaging them, the noble objectives of SDG 11 will remain an illusory, empty promise. Cities should be equalizers of wealth, not engines for hoarding obscene riches for a rapacious aristocracy. They must serve as anchors of social uplift and ecological sustainability, not cancers consuming the planet's resources. It's time we take to the barricades and reclaim our rightful stake in where and how we live. The future of civilization itself may depend upon it.
