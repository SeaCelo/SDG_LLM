Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities, written from the perspective of Gene Weingarten:

A Comedic Tragedy: The Ironic Struggle for Sustainable Cities 
By Gene Weingarten

If we're being honest, humanity's quest for sustainable cities and communities is a bit of a farce, is it not? It's the Wile E. Coyote of international development goals - we keep chasing this elusive dream, devising increasingly complex rocket-powered roller skates and Acme dynamite sticks, only to be comically foiled time and again by our own hapless ineptitude.

Don't get me wrong, the intentions behind SDG 11 are admirable. Making cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable by 2030? Lovely idea in theory. But in practice, it's like trying to squeeze an ever-expanding clown car full of suburbanites through a closing window of opportunity. One can't help but chuckle at the absurdity of it all.

Take affordable housing, for instance. Cities globally are meant to ensure access to adequate, safe, and affordable housing for all by 2030. But have you seen housing prices lately? They're more hysterically inflated than the wacky waving inflatable arm-flailing tubemen outside of used car lots. Getting a foothold on the property ladder in most major metros requires either a ludicrously high income or generational wealth passed down luckier than an heir swallowing a golden ticket.

Then there's the head-scratching goal of providing access to safe, affordable, accessible, and sustainable transport systems for all by 2030. Public transit, am I right? It's like that friend who's always just a few credits shy of graduating - constantly under construction, introducing new lines and expansions, yet never quite running on time or reaching full utility. You know what's reliable though? Traffic gridlock and soul-crushing commute times!

Speaking of transportation, let's discuss air quality and waste management targets. Cities strive to reduce their adverse environmental impacts, including paying special attention to air quality and municipal waste management. Ambitious to be sure, but have you ever visited Beijing or Delhi on a smoggy day? The air quality makes LA smog seem cleaner than Richard Gere's bathroom. As for waste management, I have visions of cities getting so overwhelmed with rubbish they'll eventually resort to implementingItaly's brilliant system of casually tossing garbage bags onto sidewalks and into public fountains.  

And how about making cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable by 2030? That's like the punchline in a joke where a priest, a rabbi, and a hitchhiking yogi try to coordinate their schedules. In most cities, different forms of inequality and discrimination run so rampantly, from income disparities to institutionalized racism, that true inclusivity feels as plausible as a squad of Rockettes performing a perfect synchronized kick-line on a runaway locomotive. Safety and resilience tend to exist more as urban legends than realities in many locales. Just ask anyone who's had to make a late night trek through a sketchy part of town, listening for telltale signs of roving machete juggling gangs.

To be fair, some progress is being made in pockets around the globe. Singapore is aiming to be a shining example of sustainability through forward-thinking urban policies. But for the most part, making the world's cities sustainable by 2030 feels about as likely as getting all 7 billion humans to cooperate on building a real-life  Flobby Robby for recreational purposes.

So by all means, UN, keep chasing that roadrunner. Devise your overly elaborate Rube Goldberg machines to try and make cities livable. Maybe, just maybe, if we keep running off that same cliff cycle after cycle,the sheer reality-defying determination will cause us to hover brieflyin that deliriously optimistic state of suspended disbelief where sustainable cities actually seem possible. Because at this point, that's about as good as it gets in our hapless, hopeless, hysterical world.
