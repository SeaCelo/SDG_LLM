Street Kids International, a leading non-profit organization dedicated to empowering marginalized urban youth, presents this analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11): Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable.

The rapid pace of urbanization poses significant challenges for cities worldwide, exacerbating inequalities, environmental degradation, and social exclusion. SDG 11 recognizes the pivotal role of cities in achieving sustainable development, addressing the multifaceted issues that arise from the complex interplay between urban environments, human well-being, and ecological systems.

At the heart of SDG 11 lies the concept of inclusive urbanization, which seeks to ensure that the benefits of urban development are equitably distributed among all segments of society, leaving no one behind. This goal challenges traditional urban planning paradigms that have historically marginalized vulnerable groups, such as street children, informal settlers, and the urban poor.

Street Kids International's on-the-ground experience has revealed the dire consequences of exclusionary urban policies. We have witnessed firsthand the harsh realities faced by street-connected youth, who are often denied access to basic services, safe public spaces, and opportunities for social and economic integration. Their precarious living conditions, compounded by lack of secure tenure and forced evictions, perpetuate cycles of poverty and vulnerability.

Achieving SDG 11 requires a paradigm shift in urban governance, moving towards participatory and inclusive decision-making processes that amplify the voices of marginalized communities. By actively engaging street-connected youth and other vulnerable groups in the planning and implementation of urban initiatives, cities can better address their specific needs and harness their unique perspectives and resilience.

Furthermore, SDG 11 emphasizes the importance of safe and affordable housing, a critical issue for street-connected youth who often lack stable shelters. Innovative housing solutions, such as transitional housing programs and community-led upgrading initiatives, can provide pathways to secure tenure and improved living conditions, fostering social cohesion and breaking the cycle of homelessness.

Sustainable urban mobility is another key aspect of SDG 11, with far-reaching implications for street-connected youth. Access to reliable and affordable public transportation can facilitate their integration into educational and employment opportunities, reducing the spatial segregation and mobility constraints they often face. Inclusive transportation systems that prioritize pedestrian safety and accessibility are crucial for creating cities that are truly inclusive and equitable.

Ensuring universal access to safe, inclusive, and accessible green and public spaces is also a priority under SDG 11. For street-connected youth, these spaces can serve as vital havens, providing opportunities for recreation, social interaction, and respite from the harsh realities of street life. By promoting inclusive and participatory design processes, cities can create public spaces that cater to the diverse needs and aspirations of all residents, fostering social cohesion and community resilience.

Moreover, SDG 11 recognizes the urgent need to address the environmental challenges faced by cities, including air pollution, waste management, and climate change impacts. Street-connected youth are among the most vulnerable to these environmental hazards, often residing in areas prone to natural disasters and lacking access to essential services. Integrating sustainable urban planning practices, such as promoting sustainable construction materials, enhancing urban biodiversity, and implementing effective waste management systems, can mitigate these environmental risks and create more resilient and livable cities for all.

Achieving the ambitious targets set forth by SDG 11 requires a concerted effort from all stakeholders, including governments, civil society organizations, private sector entities, and, most importantly, the active participation of marginalized communities themselves. Street Kids International remains committed to advocating for inclusive and sustainable urban development, amplifying the voices of street-connected youth, and fostering partnerships that drive positive change in cities around the world.

Through our innovative programs and advocacy initiatives, we strive to empower street-connected youth as agents of change, equipping them with the skills and knowledge necessary to navigate urban environments and contribute to the co-creation of inclusive and sustainable cities. By integrating their perspectives and lived experiences into urban planning processes, we can ensure that no one is left behind in the pursuit of sustainable development.
