Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 11 on sustainable cities and communities, written from the perspective of Nick Cater:

The Utopian Nightmare of Sustainable Cities
By Nick Cater

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 11 calls for making cities and human settlements "inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable." It's the type of lofty rhetoric we've come to expect from the sprawling bureaucracy pushing its grandiose vision of a centrally-planned global utopia. But beyond the feel-good platitudes lies a deeply troubling agenda that should concern all who cherish personal liberty and free markets.

At its core, SDG 11 advocates greater government control over how people live, work, and move about in urban areas. Its targets speak of increasing "resource efficiency" and "access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems." In practice, this means empowering city planners and bureaucrats to dictate housing policy, transportation options, energy use, and countless other aspects of our daily lives – all in pursuit of an ill-defined "sustainable" agenda vulnerable to abuse by those hungry for power.

The environmental alarmists behind initiatives like SDG 11 worship at the altar of climate change, perpetuating an unsubstantiated doomsday narrative to justify their radical policies. They decry the prosperity that lifted billions out of poverty as a blight on the planet, spouting pseudoscientific jargon like "urban sprawl" and "carbon footprint" to rationalize restricting personal freedom. 

Their vision for our urban future? A UN-approved model of dense, over-crowded "human settlement areas" with residents crammed into tiny eco-flats while their movements are tightly monitored and regulated for maximum "sustainability." Goodbye private automobiles and suburban homes with backyards; hello rationed public transit, urban growth boundaries, and centralized control over energy use – all under the guise of fighting a climate crisis.

Make no mistake, the "compact city" long idealized by urbanist thinkers is no accidental byproduct, but the intended result of policies like those advocated for in SDG 11. The goal's champions seek to modify human behavior by limiting housing options and mobility, herding the masses into dense zones where big government can meticulously dictate resource use in service of their environmental dogma.

Perhaps most pernicious is SDG 11's push to force countries to adopt "integrated policies…towards inclusion, resource efficiency, mitigation and adaptation to climate change [and] resilience to disasters." In bureaucratese, this means top-down, heavy-handed regulations overruling local policies – a thinly-veiled power grab by a remote cadre of UN functionaries unaccountable to people's needs or democratic processes.

The history of 20th century central planning should remind us how easily good intentions can transform into authoritarian nightmares. From the devastation of Soviet agriculture to China's ruinous Great Leap Forward, social engineers' arrogant attempts to control and "optimize" human society inevitably wreak havoc on human lives and liberties. As UN apparatchiks and their urbanist allies pursue their SDG 11 agenda, we must remain vigilantly opposed to global planners usurping our autonomy and dictating the most intimate aspects of daily living.

Our cities should develop organically in response to people's free choices and market dynamics – not be reengineered from above by bureaucrats in thrall to the latest environmental scare or philosophical fad. Let us have the wisdom to reject SDG 11's siren song of coercive global governance, preserving free and prosperous human settlements built around human liberty, not authoritarianism masquerading as "sustainability."
