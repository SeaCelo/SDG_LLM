The African Development Bank presents this analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities, with a particular focus on the African context.

Africa's rapid urbanization presents both challenges and opportunities for sustainable development. While cities are engines of economic growth and hotbeds of innovation, their expansion has often been haphazard and unplanned, leading to the proliferation of informal settlements, inadequate infrastructure, and environmental degradation. Addressing these issues is crucial for achieving SDG 11 and ensuring that African cities are inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable.

One of the primary challenges facing African cities is the lack of affordable housing. According to UN-Habitat, 56% of the urban population in sub-Saharan Africa lived in slums or informal settlements in 2018. These settlements are characterized by overcrowding, poor living conditions, and limited access to basic services such as clean water, sanitation, and electricity. Addressing this housing deficit requires a multi-pronged approach, including increasing the supply of affordable housing units, upgrading existing informal settlements, and implementing inclusive urban planning policies that prioritize the needs of the urban poor.

Sustainable transportation is another critical issue for African cities. Many urban areas are plagued by traffic congestion, poor road infrastructure, and inadequate public transportation systems. This not only hampers economic productivity but also contributes to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, exacerbating the impacts of climate change. Investing in sustainable transportation solutions, such as bus rapid transit systems, non-motorized transport infrastructure, and electric mobility, can help alleviate these challenges while promoting environmental sustainability and improving urban accessibility.

Climate change adaptation and resilience are also pressing concerns for African cities. Many urban areas are located in coastal regions or near major waterways, making them vulnerable to sea-level rise, flooding, and other climate-related hazards. Building resilient infrastructure, implementing early warning systems, and promoting ecosystem-based adaptation strategies, such as urban greening and wetland restoration, can help cities prepare for and mitigate the impacts of climate change.

Effective urban governance and participatory planning are essential for achieving sustainable urban development in Africa. Many cities lack the institutional capacity and resources to manage rapid urbanization, leading to poor service delivery, inadequate infrastructure maintenance, and limited public participation in decision-making processes. Strengthening local governance through capacity-building, decentralization, and community engagement can help ensure that urban development policies and initiatives are responsive to the needs of local populations and aligned with sustainable development principles.

Furthermore, addressing the challenges of sustainable urbanization in Africa requires significant financial investment. However, many African cities struggle to access the necessary funding due to limited fiscal resources, underdeveloped capital markets, and a lack of bankable projects. Innovative financing mechanisms, such as public-private partnerships, municipal bonds, and climate finance instruments, can help unlock the capital needed to fund sustainable urban infrastructure and services.

In conclusion, achieving SDG 11 in the African context requires a holistic approach that addresses the multifaceted challenges of rapid urbanization, while leveraging the opportunities presented by cities as drivers of economic growth and innovation. By prioritizing affordable housing, sustainable transportation, climate resilience, effective urban governance, and innovative financing mechanisms, African cities can become more inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable, contributing to the overall achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.
