CARE's in-depth analysis of Sustainable Development Goal 11 – Sustainable Cities and Communities – paints a sobering picture of the global urban landscape. As the world's population continues its inexorable shift towards cities, the challenges of creating inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable urban environments have never been more pressing.

Our organization's extensive field experience across the Global South underscores the multifaceted nature of this goal. In the sprawling informal settlements of megacities like Mumbai, Dhaka, and Lagos, we bear witness to the grim realities of inadequate housing, lack of basic services, and the ever-present threat of eviction. These conditions not only deprive millions of their fundamental human rights but also foster cycles of poverty, marginalization, and environmental degradation.

Yet, the urban challenge extends far beyond the slums. Even in cities lauded for their modernity and prosperity, we see the insidious effects of skyrocketing housing costs, inefficient public transportation systems, and the disproportionate impact of natural disasters and climate change on the most vulnerable populations. The COVID-19 pandemic has further laid bare the fragility of urban systems, with the virus spreading rapidly through densely populated areas and exacerbating existing inequalities.

Addressing these complex issues requires a holistic, multidimensional approach that cuts across sectors and disciplines. CARE's work in this realm is guided by a deep understanding of the intersectionality of urban challenges, recognizing that sustainable cities cannot be achieved without addressing issues of gender equality, economic empowerment, and environmental justice.

In Nairobi, for instance, our urban resilience program has focused on empowering women and girls through livelihood initiatives, reproductive health services, and leadership training. By strengthening their economic and social capital, we are not only improving individual lives but also fostering more cohesive, inclusive communities capable of withstanding shocks and stresses.

In Vietnam, our efforts have centered on disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation, working with local authorities and communities to develop early warning systems, strengthen infrastructure, and promote sustainable land-use practices. This multifaceted approach not only enhances resilience but also contributes to the broader goal of sustainable urbanization by preserving natural resources and minimizing environmental degradation.

While the challenges are daunting, CARE remains steadfastly committed to the vision of Sustainable Development Goal 11. We recognize that creating truly sustainable cities and communities requires a fundamental shift in mindsets and paradigms – a move away from the traditional top-down, technocratic approach towards a more participatory, inclusive, and community-driven model.

To this end, we are actively engaged in advocacy efforts at the local, national, and global levels, amplifying the voices of marginalized urban populations and pushing for policies and governance frameworks that prioritize human rights, social inclusion, and environmental stewardship. Our partnerships with grassroots organizations, civil society groups, and academic institutions are critical to this endeavor, ensuring that our interventions are grounded in local knowledge and context-specific solutions.

As we look towards the future, CARE's vision for sustainable cities and communities is one of vibrancy, resilience, and equity. We envision urban spaces that are not only environmentally sustainable but also socially and economically inclusive, where all residents have access to affordable housing, safe public spaces, and opportunities for economic advancement. We see cities that are not just surviving but thriving, harnessing the power of innovation and technology to create more livable, prosperous, and resilient communities.

Achieving this vision will require sustained commitment, political will, and collective action from all stakeholders – governments, civil society, the private sector, and citizens themselves. CARE stands ready to play its part, leveraging our decades of experience, expertise, and global reach to drive progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 11 and build a more just, equitable, and sustainable urban future for all.
