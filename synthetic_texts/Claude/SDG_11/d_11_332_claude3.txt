Liechtenstein, a small Alpine nation nestled between Switzerland and Austria, has long been committed to sustainable development, both within its borders and through its international partnerships. In this analytical report, we delve into the nation's efforts towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 11: making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable.

Liechtenstein's urban landscape, though modest in scale, exemplifies the principles of sustainable urbanization. With a population of just under 40,000 and an area of 62 square miles, the country's only municipality, Schaan, serves as a model for compact, efficient, and livable urban design. The town's pedestrian-friendly layout, combined with an extensive network of public transportation, including electric buses and a well-maintained cycling infrastructure, has significantly reduced reliance on private vehicles, minimizing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.

Sustainable housing has been a priority for Liechtenstein, with the government implementing stringent building codes and incentives for energy-efficient construction. The country's commitment to affordable housing is evident in the prevalence of cooperatively-owned apartment complexes, which offer quality living spaces at reasonable costs. Additionally, the government has taken proactive measures to protect and maintain its cultural heritage, with historic buildings and landmarks undergoing careful restoration and preservation efforts.

Beyond its domestic endeavors, Liechtenstein has played a crucial role in promoting sustainable urbanization on the global stage. Through its bilateral and multilateral partnerships, the country has provided technical expertise and financial support to developing nations grappling with rapid urbanization. Notably, Liechtenstein has contributed to initiatives aimed at improving access to safe and affordable housing, upgrading slum settlements, and enhancing urban resilience against natural disasters and climate change impacts.

One exemplary project supported by Liechtenstein is the Sustainable Cities Programme in Nepal, a joint initiative with UN-Habitat. This program has focused on improving urban planning, infrastructure development, and community engagement in rapidly growing cities like Kathmandu and Pokhara. Liechtenstein's contributions have facilitated the implementation of sustainable transportation systems, the establishment of public spaces, and the promotion of inclusive governance practices.

Furthermore, Liechtenstein has been a vocal advocate for the integration of urban sustainability into international climate change negotiations and commitments. The country's delegation to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has consistently emphasized the importance of addressing urban emissions and promoting climate-resilient urban development, especially in vulnerable regions.

Liechtenstein's commitment to SDG 11 extends beyond mere financial contributions; it encompasses a holistic approach that recognizes the interconnectedness of sustainable urbanization with other global challenges. For instance, the country has supported initiatives that link urban development with environmental conservation, such as the Sustainable Cities Integrated Approach Pilot in Malaysia, which aims to balance urban growth with the protection of biodiversity and ecosystem services.

Looking ahead, Liechtenstein is poised to continue its leadership role in promoting sustainable urbanization. The country's recently adopted National Sustainable Development Strategy 2030 outlines ambitious targets and actions related to SDG 11, including further reducing emissions from the building sector, enhancing public transportation infrastructure, and promoting inclusive public spaces for all citizens.

Moreover, Liechtenstein's commitment to international cooperation and knowledge-sharing remains unwavering. Through its partnerships with organizations like UN-Habitat, the World Bank, and various non-governmental organizations, the country continues to share its expertise and learn from best practices worldwide, fostering a global exchange of ideas and solutions for sustainable urban development.

In conclusion, Liechtenstein's efforts towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 11 are commendable and multifaceted. From its domestic successes in sustainable urban planning and housing to its impactful international partnerships and advocacy, the country serves as a model for how even small nations can make significant contributions towards creating inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities and human settlements worldwide.
