Achieving Sustainable Cities and Communities: A Causal Inference Perspective on SDG 11

By Guido Imbens

As an econometrician and researcher, I approach the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through the lens of causal inference and statistical analysis. SDG 11, which aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable, presents a complex challenge that requires rigorous empirical evaluation and evidence-based policymaking.

Urbanization is a global phenomenon, with over half of the world's population residing in cities. While cities are engines of economic growth and innovation, they are also grappling with pressing issues such as inadequate housing, poor air quality, lack of green spaces, and insufficient public transportation. Addressing these challenges is crucial for achieving sustainable development and improving the well-being of urban residents.

To make progress towards SDG 11, we must employ causal inference methods to understand the impact of various interventions and policies on urban sustainability. For instance, we can use quasi-experimental designs, such as regression discontinuity or difference-in-differences, to evaluate the effectiveness of initiatives aimed at improving access to affordable housing or reducing urban sprawl.

One area of particular interest is the causal impact of public transportation infrastructure on urban sustainability. Investing in reliable and efficient public transportation systems can potentially reduce greenhouse gas emissions, alleviate traffic congestion, and improve air quality. However, estimating the causal effect of such investments is challenging due to potential confounding factors, such as population density, land-use patterns, and socioeconomic factors.

To address this challenge, researchers have employed instrumental variable (IV) techniques, exploiting exogenous variation in transportation infrastructure investments. For example, Baum-Snow and Kahn (2000) used the proposed rail transit routes from the 1960s as an instrument to estimate the impact of rail transit on urban form and population density in major U.S. cities. Their findings suggest that rail transit led to more compact and dense urban development, contributing to sustainable urban growth.

Another critical aspect of SDG 11 is ensuring access to safe, inclusive, and accessible green public spaces, which are vital for physical and mental well-being, social cohesion, and environmental sustainability. To evaluate the impact of urban green spaces on various outcomes, researchers have employed spatial econometric techniques and geospatial data analysis.

For instance, Roe et al. (2017) used propensity score matching to estimate the causal effect of urban green space proximity on mental well-being in the United Kingdom. Their findings suggest that living in areas with higher green space coverage is associated with lower mental distress and higher life satisfaction, highlighting the importance of urban green spaces for public health and well-being.

In addition to evaluating the impact of specific interventions, causal inference methods can also be used to understand the complex interactions and trade-offs among the various components of SDG 11. For example, policies aimed at increasing housing affordability may inadvertently contribute to urban sprawl and increased transportation emissions, potentially conflicting with sustainability goals.

To address these trade-offs, researchers have employed structural econometric models and simulation techniques to analyze the interplay between different urban policies and their potential outcomes. These models can incorporate behavioral responses, general equilibrium effects, and feedback loops, providing policymakers with a more comprehensive understanding of the potential consequences of their decisions.

Furthermore, causal inference methods can be used to explore heterogeneous treatment effects and identify subpopulations that may benefit more or less from specific interventions. This information is crucial for designing targeted and equitable policies that address the diverse needs of urban residents, particularly marginalized and vulnerable groups.

As we strive to achieve SDG 11, it is essential to recognize that sustainable urban development is a multifaceted challenge that requires interdisciplinary collaboration and a deep understanding of the complex social, economic, and environmental systems that shape our cities. Causal inference methods, combined with insights from urban planning, environmental science, sociology, and other relevant disciplines, can provide policymakers with the evidence-based insights necessary to implement effective and sustainable solutions.

In conclusion, achieving SDG 11 requires a rigorous and data-driven approach, leveraging the power of causal inference and statistical analysis. By employing techniques such as quasi-experimental designs, instrumental variable methods, spatial econometrics, and structural models, we can evaluate the impact of urban policies and interventions, understand trade-offs and interactions, and design targeted and equitable solutions. Ultimately, this evidence-based approach will enable us to create truly sustainable, inclusive, and resilient cities for generations to come.
