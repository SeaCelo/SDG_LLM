Save the Children's Analytical Report on Sustainable Development Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

As the world's population continues to urbanize at an unprecedented rate, the need for sustainable, inclusive, and resilient cities has never been more pressing. The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11) aims to address this challenge by promoting the development of cities and human settlements that are safe, affordable, and environmentally sustainable.

One of the primary focus areas of SDG 11 is ensuring access to adequate, safe, and affordable housing for all. In many cities, particularly in developing countries, rapid urbanization has led to the proliferation of informal settlements and slums, where residents lack access to basic services such as clean water, sanitation, and electricity. These settlements are often located in areas prone to natural disasters, further exacerbating the vulnerability of their inhabitants.

Save the Children has been working tirelessly to address this issue by advocating for inclusive and participatory urban planning processes that prioritize the needs of the most vulnerable populations, including children and their families. Our organization has been collaborating with local governments and community-based organizations to improve living conditions in informal settlements through the provision of basic services, upgrading of housing structures, and the development of disaster risk reduction strategies.

A notable example of our work in this area is the Urban Resilience Program in Bangladesh, which aimed to improve the resilience of urban communities in Dhaka and Chittagong to natural disasters and climate change impacts. Through this program, we worked with local partners to enhance disaster preparedness, improve access to basic services, and strengthen community-based organizations' capacity to advocate for their rights.

Another critical aspect of SDG 11 is the promotion of sustainable and inclusive urban mobility. In many cities, inadequate public transportation systems and over-reliance on private vehicles have led to severe traffic congestion, air pollution, and social exclusion. Children and families living in marginalized communities often face significant barriers in accessing education, healthcare, and employment opportunities due to the lack of affordable and accessible transportation options.

Save the Children has been advocating for the development of integrated, multi-modal transportation systems that prioritize public transportation, walking, and cycling. We have been working with local authorities to promote the adoption of sustainable urban mobility plans that incorporate child-friendly design principles, such as safe walking and cycling routes, and prioritize the needs of vulnerable groups, including children, women, and persons with disabilities.

A noteworthy example of our work in this area is the Child-Friendly Cities Initiative in Vietnam, where we have been collaborating with local authorities to improve urban infrastructure and services to better meet the needs of children and their families. Through this initiative, we have supported the development of child-friendly public spaces, safe walking and cycling routes, and the integration of children's perspectives into urban planning processes.

Furthermore, SDG 11 recognizes the importance of protecting and safeguarding the world's cultural and natural heritage. Many cities around the world are home to invaluable cultural and historical sites that are at risk of degradation due to factors such as urbanization, pollution, and climate change. Save the Children has been working to raise awareness about the importance of preserving these sites for future generations and promoting sustainable tourism practices that respect local communities and their cultural heritage.

For instance, our organization has been collaborating with local authorities and community-based organizations in Peru to promote sustainable tourism practices in the Cusco region, home to the iconic Machu Picchu. Through this initiative, we have been supporting the development of community-based tourism initiatives that prioritize the preservation of cultural heritage, environmental protection, and the economic empowerment of local communities.

Another critical aspect of SDG 11 is the need to build resilient and sustainable cities that are capable of withstanding the impacts of natural disasters and climate change. With the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, many cities around the world are facing significant risks to their infrastructure, economies, and the well-being of their residents.

Save the Children has been at the forefront of promoting disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation strategies in urban areas. We have been working with local governments, communities, and other stakeholders to develop and implement comprehensive disaster preparedness plans, strengthen early warning systems, and enhance the resilience of critical infrastructure and services.

A notable example of our work in this area is the Urban Resilience Program in the Philippines, where we have been working to enhance the resilience of urban communities to natural disasters and climate change impacts. Through this program, we have been supporting the development of community-based disaster risk reduction strategies, the establishment of early warning systems, and the promotion of eco-friendly construction techniques and infrastructure development.

As we look towards the future, it is clear that achieving SDG 11 will require a collaborative and concerted effort from all stakeholders, including governments, civil society organizations, the private sector, and local communities. Save the Children remains committed to advocating for sustainable, inclusive, and resilient cities and communities, where all children and their families have access to safe and affordable housing, reliable public services, and opportunities for economic and social development.

Through our various initiatives and programs, we will continue to work alongside local partners and communities to promote participatory urban planning processes, sustainable urban mobility solutions, and the preservation of cultural and natural heritage. We will also continue to prioritize disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation strategies, ensuring that cities are equipped to withstand the impacts of natural disasters and environmental challenges.

Ultimately, the success of SDG 11 will be measured not only by the physical transformation of cities but also by the improved well-being and quality of life of their residents, particularly the most vulnerable populations, including children and their families. By fostering inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities and communities, we can create a brighter future for all.
