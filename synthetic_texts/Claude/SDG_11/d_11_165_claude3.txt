Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), written from the perspective of satirical novelist Carl Hiaasen:

Down here in the sweaty underbelly of South Florida, we've got some sustainable cities, all right - if by "sustainable" you mean sustained levels of corruption, stupidity, and wanton environmental destruction. I swear, sometimes I think the only reason this state hasn't been swallowed whole by the rising sea levels is out of vengeful spite - the oceans are just biding their time before drowning us like the thick-headed gators we are. 

Don't get me wrong, SDG 11 has some noble aims as far as making our cities and communities more resilient, inclusive, and sustainable. But have you taken a good look at what passes for urban planning around these parts? It's like a frat house kegger where everyone's trying to outdo each other with feats of supreme idiocy until the whole place is trashed beyond repair.

Take Miami for instance - a city rapidly sinking into a feverish, climatological abyss, yet our esteemed civic leaders remain hell-bent on paving over every last shred of pervious surface with tacky high-rises and big-box shopping prediets. That way every time we get hit by a tropical storm's storm surge, it has nowhere to drain except into the eroding foundations of those glistening new condos perched on the beach like a line of seawall dominoes waiting to be swept out to sea by the next Hurricane Rapture. But hey, at least we've got plenty of "affordable" housing in the form of dilapidated low-income tenements and hoary public housing projects straight out of a dystopian sci-fi flick.

Then you've got the suburban hellscape engulfing places like Naples and Fort Lauderdale where rich retirees and bored trophy wives tool around in their planet-killing SUVs between the Botox clinics and Ruth's Chris while whole ecosystems are bulldozed to make way for yet another Bermuda-shorted gated community squatting athwart what was once a verdant stretch of pine flatwoods. Meanwhile, local zoning boards rubber-stamp every harebrained development scheme as long as there's enough "green space" in the form of heavily fertilized and pesticide-soaked golf course green deserts.  

Mind you, I'm not some eco-freak tree-hugger myself. I just figured after watching my hometown of Miami slowly drown over the last few decades that maybe - just maybe - we'd finally cop to the reality that rampant overdevelopment and reckless disregard for the environment isn't exactly a sustainable growth model. But who am I kidding? Down here, the only things that grow sustainably are the ravening egos and off-shore bank accounts of the shady developers and corrupt bureaucrats whose greed is swiftly rendering these cities uninhabitable for all but the wealthiest few.

So yeah, by all means - keep pursuing those Sustainable Development Goals. Just don't be surprised if by the time the checklist is complete in another few decades, all our cities have been reclaimed by nature with a vengeance, with nothing but a few barnacle-encrusted high-rise husks left protruding from the tepid waters to greet the explorers of the 23rd century.  They'll surely marvel at the ruins and ponder just how such stunningly idiotic life forms managed to foul their own nest to such a degree before evolution mercifully intervened.
