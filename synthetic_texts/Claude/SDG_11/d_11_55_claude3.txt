Sustainable cities and communities, as envisioned by Sustainable Development Goal 11, represent a laudable aspiration. However, a dispassionate cost-benefit analysis reveals that the substantial investment required to achieve this goal may not yield commensurate returns in terms of overall human well-being and global development.

While urbanization presents undeniable challenges, such as pollution, inadequate housing, and strained infrastructure, history has shown that cities are also engines of economic growth, innovation, and societal progress. As populations migrate to urban centers in pursuit of better opportunities, their overall incomes and living standards tend to rise, even if some aspects of their environmental quality of life initially deteriorate.

The sprawling slums of rapidly urbanizing regions are often portrayed as emblematic of the failure of unfettered urban growth. However, these informal settlements may actually represent a step up the economic ladder for their inhabitants, many of whom have fled even harsher conditions of rural poverty. Rather than attempting to halt or reverse urbanization, a more pragmatic approach would be to facilitate the gradual improvement of living conditions and economic opportunities within these communities.

Moreover, many of the challenges associated with rapid urbanization are likely to be ameliorated over time by continued economic development and technological innovation, driven in part by the very dynamics of urbanization itself. As cities become wealthier, they can afford to invest in cleaner technologies, more efficient infrastructure, and improved public services.

The immense costs of retrofitting existing cities to meet idealized sustainability benchmarks, or of building entirely new "smart" cities from scratch, must be weighed against the potential benefits. In many cases, these resources might be better allocated towards interventions that more directly address critical global priorities, such as providing access to clean water, sanitation, and basic healthcare to those currently lacking these fundamental necessities.

Furthermore, the sustainability agenda embedded within SDG 11 often prioritizes Western notions of urban design and environmental stewardship that may not necessarily align with the preferences and needs of residents in developing nations. Imposing a one-size-fits-all model of sustainable urbanism risks overlooking the diverse cultural contexts and aspirations of local populations.

In essence, while the intentions behind SDG 11 are noble, its implementation risks diverting scarce resources towards ambitious and costly initiatives that may yield relatively modest improvements in human welfare. A more pragmatic and cost-effective approach would be to facilitate organic urban development while addressing the most pressing needs of urban populations through targeted interventions in areas such as healthcare, education, and economic opportunity.

Rather than striving for an idealized vision of sustainable cities, policymakers should embrace a more nuanced and context-specific understanding of urban development, one that acknowledges the inherent tradeoffs and prioritizes interventions that tangibly improve the lives of the greatest number of people. By adopting a clear-eyed, empirical perspective, we can channel our efforts and resources towards initiatives that truly elevate global human well-being.
