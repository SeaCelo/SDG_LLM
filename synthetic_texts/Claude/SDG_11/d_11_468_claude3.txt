Here is a long newspaper article about Sustainable Development Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), written in a style similar to The Economist:

A Tale of Two Cities

The year is 2030, and Jakarta has become a post-apocalyptic urban nightmare. Once a thriving megacity of over 30 million souls, it now teeters on the brink of unlivability. Chronic traffic congestion, crippling air pollution, and a severe affordable housing crisis have made life unbearable for all but the wealthy elite. Rising sea levels have inundated many low-lying slums, displacing millions. Municipal services have all but collapsed under the weight of decades of underinvestment and mismanagement. Jakarta is a sobering example of what cities can become if urbanization is left unchecked and unsustainable.

Yet 700 miles away in Singapore, an entirely different reality unfolds. The orderly city-state is a paragon of urban efficiency and livability, with seamless public transportation, pristine air quality, and cutting-edge green buildings integrated into lush gardens and nature reserves. Renewable energy powers most homes and businesses. Housing is affordable and accessible. Public spaces abound. Residents enjoy an enviable quality of life bolstered by diligent long-term planning and substantial investments aimed at making Singapore the world's most sustainable city.

The divergent trajectories of Jakarta and Singapore encapsulate both the immense challenge and tantalizing promise embodied in Sustainable Development Goal 11: make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable by 2030. At stake is not just the wellbeing of the more than half of humanity currently residing in cities, but the very future of our urbanizing world. Unbridled growth of unplanned cities like Jakarta will prove catastrophic, while compact, transit-oriented, resource-efficient urban gems like Singapore offer a model for how to absorb rapidly growing populations without imperiling the planet.

The battle for sustainable cities will be won or lost in the emerging world. Asia alone is projected to add a staggering 1 billion new urban residents by 2040, with Africa not far behind. UN-Habitat estimates a mind-boggling $3.5 trillion per year must be invested in urban infrastructure by 2050 merely to keep pace with anticipated growth. Ensuring this development follows a sustainable trajectory, as exemplified by SDG 11's targets for upgrading slums, expanding green spaces, reducing sprawl, bolstering resilience, and preserving cultural heritage, will be one of this century's paramount challenges.

But implementing the lofty ideals of Goal 11 on the ground has proven immensely difficult thus far. With a few shining exceptions like Singapore, the vast majority of cities are falling woefully short. A daunting 1 billion urban dwellers currently live in informal settlements, many lacking basic services like clean water and sanitation. Rapid motorization has rendered many cities virtually unbreathable, with urban air pollution causing 4.2 million premature deaths annually according to the World Health Organization. The greenhouse gas emissions and catastrophic climate risks posed by unchecked urban sprawl make many cities utterly unsustainable in the long run.

Tackling these interconnected challenges requires bold and coordinated interventions across the realms of urban planning, municipal finance, infrastructure investment, governance reform, and citizen empowerment. But the imperative to create truly sustainable cities has never been more urgent. In the words of former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, "There is no plan B because there is no planet B."

Progress starts with cities recognizing their fundamental economic self-interest in pursuing sustainable growth. The World Bank estimates air pollution alone costs cities in low- and middle-income countries over $2 trillion per year in health expenditures and labor productivity losses. Sprawling development patterns that eat away at precious agricultural lands and biodiversity reserves undermine cities' own long-term food and water security. Ignoring resilience leaves cities catastrophically vulnerable to climate shocks and natural disasters that can roll back decades of hard-won development gains in an instant.

The most visionary cities are thus embracing what the OECD has dubbed the "complementary revolution"—investing in dense, mixed-use, transit-oriented development that couples sustainability with enhanced economic productivity, job creation, and quality of life. Singapore is the quintessential example, but cities as diverse as Copenhagen, Curitiba, and Auckland have all leveraged smart density and sustainable mobility to reap a generative cycle of environmental, economic, and social dividends.

Getting the spatial geography right is only half the battle, however. Cities must also reinvent their internal financial and governance machinery to enable transformative investments in sustainable infrastructure. Too often, budgets are consumed by bloated payrolls and recurrent expenditures rather than catalytic capital projects. Antiquated procurement rules and capacity constraints hamper public-private partnerships vital for scaling up climate-smart solutions. Institutional inertia and lack of citizen engagement impede bold reforms to get prices right on externalities like pollution, congestion, and parking.

But a vanguard of cities have demonstrated what effective public financial management, regulatory reform, and participatory governance in service of long-term sustainability can look like. Johannesburg instituted pioneering municipal bonds earmarked specifically for climate and environmental initiatives. Policies to charge for road use and parking space funded game-changing expansions of bus rapid transit systems in Seoul and Jakarta. Citizen crowd-sourcing platforms guided community-led slum upgrading in cities like Nairobi and Rio de Janeiro. In short, empowering local governments to spearhead change tailored to their unique contexts can work wonders.

Truly achieving Goal 11's vision of cities that provide opportunity and decent shelter for all will, however, fundamentally require resolving the intractable challenges of urban informality, inequality, and societal exclusion. Informal settlements are too often manifestations of failed governance, unaffordable housing markets, discrimination, and lack of secure land tenure that deny billions of urban denizens a meaningful stake in their cities.

But just as slums are not simply a spatial or infrastructural issue, their solutions must go beyond just physical upgrading to fundamentally transform the systems, institutions, and power structures that produce urban poverty and marginalization in the first place. Granting residents secure property rights, diversifying affordable housing finance, empowering grassroots organizations, and achieving participative, inclusive decision-making are all vital ingredients for creating truly inclusive cities that leave no community or individual behind. It's an arduous but indispensable process—one that must be pursued in parallel with the environmental sustainability agenda, as the two are inextricably intertwined.

The next decade will prove existentially defining for SDG 11. The world's cities stand at an inflection point, with the immense challenges posed by unchecked growth and unsustainable trajectories intersecting with unprecedented technological and governance opportunities to steer a new course. Making the right investments and reforms today to build smarter, greener, more resilient and equitable cities won't just determine the fates of billions of present and future urban residents. It will shape the very future of sustainable human development on planet Earth altogether. The stakes could not be higher.
