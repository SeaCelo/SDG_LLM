The global commitment to achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11 – Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable – has taken on heightened significance for least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs). These nations face unique challenges that exacerbate the complexities of urbanization, necessitating tailored approaches and targeted interventions.

LDCs grapple with rapid and often unplanned urban growth, stemming from rural-urban migration driven by poverty, conflict, and environmental degradation. This influx strains already inadequate infrastructure, housing, and basic services, leading to the proliferation of informal settlements and slums. Inadequate urban planning, weak governance, and limited financial resources compound these issues, hindering efforts to create inclusive, safe, and sustainable urban environments.

SIDS, on the other hand, confront the dual challenges of urbanization and climate change. With limited land area and high population densities, urbanization in SIDS exerts immense pressure on fragile ecosystems and scarce resources. Rising sea levels, coastal erosion, and extreme weather events threaten coastal settlements, necessitating proactive adaptation measures and resilient infrastructure. Moreover, the geographic isolation of SIDS hinders access to global markets and supply chains, impeding economic development and sustainable urbanization.

LLDCs face unique obstacles in achieving SDG 11 due to their lack of territorial access to the sea, remote geographical locations, and high transport costs. Landlocked urban centers often suffer from inadequate infrastructure, limited economic opportunities, and insufficient access to global markets. The reliance on transit through neighboring countries further complicates the development of sustainable transportation networks and trade facilitation, impeding the growth of urban economies.

To address these challenges, a holistic and context-specific approach is essential. Strengthening urban governance and institutional capacities is crucial for effective urban planning, policy formulation, and implementation. Encouraging participatory decision-making processes that involve local communities, civil society organizations, and the private sector can foster ownership and tailored solutions.

Investing in resilient and sustainable infrastructure is a critical priority. This includes developing robust transportation systems, energy-efficient buildings, and climate-resilient housing, as well as ensuring access to safe and affordable water, sanitation, and waste management services. Leveraging innovative technologies, such as renewable energy sources and smart city solutions, can enhance sustainability and resource efficiency.

Promoting inclusive and integrated urban development is vital for addressing spatial and socioeconomic inequalities. This entails adopting policies that facilitate access to affordable housing, healthcare, education, and employment opportunities for marginalized groups, including women, youth, and persons with disabilities. Targeted interventions are needed to upgrade informal settlements, promote secure land tenure, and improve living conditions.

Fostering sustainable economic growth and employment opportunities within urban centers is pivotal for reducing poverty and promoting inclusive urbanization. This may involve supporting local entrepreneurship, attracting foreign direct investment, and developing industries that align with the unique strengths and resources of each nation.

Collaboration and knowledge-sharing among LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs are essential for exchanging best practices, leveraging collective resources, and developing tailored solutions. Regional and international partnerships can facilitate access to financing, technical assistance, and capacity-building initiatives, enabling these nations to overcome their unique challenges and accelerate progress towards SDG 11.

Furthermore, integrating urban development strategies with efforts to combat climate change, protect biodiversity, and enhance disaster risk reduction is critical. Adopting nature-based solutions, such as green infrastructure and ecosystem-based adaptation measures, can simultaneously enhance urban resilience, mitigate environmental degradation, and foster sustainable livelihoods.

Achieving SDG 11 in LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the interconnected challenges of urbanization, environmental sustainability, economic development, and social inclusion. By prioritizing context-specific interventions, leveraging innovative solutions, fostering partnerships, and adopting integrated strategies, these nations can pave the way for inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities and human settlements, ultimately contributing to the broader 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
