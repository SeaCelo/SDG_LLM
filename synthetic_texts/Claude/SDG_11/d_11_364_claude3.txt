Esteemed colleagues and members of the advisory committee,

The European Investment Bank has been at the forefront of promoting sustainable urban development and resilient infrastructure, aligning our efforts closely with the ambitious targets set forth by Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11). As we navigate the complex challenges posed by rapid urbanization, climate change, and growing inequalities, it is imperative that we adopt a multifaceted approach to creating inclusive, safe, and resilient cities and human settlements.

Our recent investments in sustainable urban mobility have yielded remarkable results, with cities across Europe embracing innovative solutions to reduce emissions, improve air quality, and enhance accessibility. The strategic deployment of electric buses, bike-sharing programs, and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure has not only contributed to lowering carbon footprints but has also fostered a cultural shift towards more sustainable modes of transportation.

However, we must recognize that sustainable urbanization extends far beyond transportation alone. Ensuring access to adequate, safe, and affordable housing remains a pressing challenge, particularly in densely populated urban centers. Our efforts to promote inclusive and integrated housing policies, coupled with investments in sustainable and resilient building practices, have helped address this issue while simultaneously mitigating the environmental impact of construction and promoting energy efficiency.

One of the notable successes has been our partnership with local authorities in several European cities to revitalize neglected urban areas and transform them into vibrant, mixed-use communities. By incorporating green spaces, public amenities, and affordable housing options, these projects have not only improved the quality of life for residents but have also fostered social cohesion and economic opportunities.

Moreover, our focus on safeguarding and promoting cultural and natural heritage has been instrumental in preserving the unique identities of cities while enhancing their resilience to natural disasters and climate change impacts. Through targeted investments in adaptive infrastructure, disaster risk reduction strategies, and public awareness campaigns, we have empowered communities to better prepare for and respond to environmental challenges.

Nonetheless, we must acknowledge the persistent challenges that hinder the full realization of SDG 11. Inadequate urban planning, lack of public-private partnerships, and inadequate financing mechanisms continue to impede progress in many regions. To address these issues, we have been actively engaging with local authorities, civil society organizations, and private sector entities to develop innovative financing models and foster collaborative governance frameworks.

One such initiative is our recently launched Urban Resilience Fund, which aims to catalyze investments in climate-resilient infrastructure and sustainable urban development projects. By leveraging public and private capital, this fund seeks to unlock new financing streams and accelerate the implementation of transformative projects that enhance urban resilience and promote inclusive growth.

Furthermore, we recognize the critical role of data and technology in driving sustainable urban development. Our investments in smart city solutions, such as intelligent traffic management systems, energy-efficient building automation, and digital platforms for citizen engagement, have empowered cities to optimize resource utilization, enhance service delivery, and foster participatory decision-making processes.

As we look ahead, it is clear that achieving the ambitious targets of SDG 11 will require a concerted effort from all stakeholders. The European Investment Bank remains committed to fostering collaborative partnerships, leveraging our expertise and financial resources to support innovative and scalable solutions that address the multifaceted challenges of urbanization.

By embracing a holistic approach that integrates economic, social, and environmental considerations, we can transform our cities into vibrant hubs of sustainability, resilience, and inclusive growth, paving the way for a more prosperous and equitable future for all.
