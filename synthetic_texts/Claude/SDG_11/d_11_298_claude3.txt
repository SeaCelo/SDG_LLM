Sustainable cities and communities – the eleventh Sustainable Development Goal – is a noble endeavour, yet one that poses immense challenges. As an economist and scholar of decision theory, I approach this topic from the lens of rational choice under uncertainty. The inherent complexity and interconnectedness of urban systems, coupled with the myriad uncertainties they encompass, demand rigorous analytical frameworks to inform policy decisions.

At the crux of SDG 11 lies the pursuit of inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities – a pursuit inextricably linked to questions of individual and collective decision-making. How do we design urban spaces that foster social cohesion and economic opportunity while mitigating the adverse impacts of urbanization on the environment and public health? How do we balance the competing demands of stakeholders with diverse preferences and constraints? And how do we account for the deep uncertainties inherent in projecting future urban dynamics, technological advancements, and exogenous shocks?

These questions underscore the need for decision-theoretic approaches that explicitly acknowledge and grapple with the pervasive uncertainties that pervade urban planning and policymaking. Traditional models of rational choice under risk, which assume known probability distributions over potential outcomes, are often inadequate in this context. Instead, we must embrace more expansive frameworks that accommodate ambiguity – situations where the underlying probability laws are themselves uncertain or incompletely specified.

One promising avenue is the use of partial identification analysis, which delineates the ranges of values that choice-relevant parameters may take without imposing potentially untenable distributional assumptions. By characterizing these identification regions, we can derive robust policy conclusions that remain valid across a broad range of plausible scenarios – an invaluable asset in the face of deep uncertainty.

Consider, for instance, the challenge of designing affordable housing policies that promote socioeconomic integration while respecting individual preferences and constraints. Traditional approaches might rely on strong assumptions about the distribution of household incomes, housing valuations, and neighborhood externalities. In contrast, a partial identification analysis could yield policy prescriptions that remain valid across a wide range of plausible income distributions, value functions, and externality specifications – enhancing the robustness and credibility of the resulting policies.

Similar approaches could be applied to questions of urban transportation, infrastructure planning, environmental regulation, and disaster risk reduction – all core components of SDG 11. By embracing decision-theoretic frameworks that explicitly acknowledge and grapple with uncertainty, we can craft more resilient and adaptive urban policies that withstand the vicissitudes of an ever-changing world.

Yet, the pursuit of sustainable cities and communities transcends mere analytical rigor; it demands a fundamental reckoning with the ethical foundations of urban planning and policymaking. As scholars and policymakers, we must confront thorny questions of equity, fairness, and intergenerational justice. How do we balance the needs of current urban residents with those of future generations? How do we ensure that the benefits and burdens of urbanization are equitably distributed across socioeconomic strata? And how do we empower marginalized communities to have a voice in the decisions that shape their lived environments?

These ethical quandaries are not mere theoretical constructs; they manifest in tangible policy choices with profound real-world consequences. The siting of industrial facilities, the allocation of public goods and services, the prioritization of infrastructure projects – each of these decisions has distributive implications that reverberate across space and time. To navigate these ethical minefields, we must embrace decision-theoretic frameworks that explicitly incorporate principles of fairness, equity, and intergenerational justice.

One promising approach lies in the realm of social choice theory, which grapples with the aggregation of individual preferences into collective decisions. By incorporating axioms of fairness and equity into our social welfare functions, we can derive policy prescriptions that respect deeply held normative principles while remaining grounded in rigorous analytical foundations.

Moreover, we must embrace participatory and deliberative decision-making processes that amplify the voices of those most affected by urban policies. Traditional top-down approaches to urban planning, while analytically rigorous, often fail to capture the nuanced preferences and constraints of diverse stakeholder groups. By actively engaging communities in the decision-making process, we can better understand their lived experiences, values, and aspirations – invaluable inputs for crafting policies that resonate with and empower those they affect.

In this regard, the pursuit of sustainable cities and communities is not merely a technical exercise; it is a profound act of human empathy and ethical reckoning. It demands that we transcend the confines of narrow disciplinary silos and embrace a holistic, interdisciplinary approach that synthesizes insights from economics, urban planning, environmental science, sociology, and ethics.

Only by embracing this integrative mindset can we hope to confront the multifaceted challenges posed by SDG 11. The road ahead is arduous, fraught with uncertainties and ethical dilemmas. But by harnessing the power of decision theory, embracing participatory decision-making processes, and anchoring our efforts in a deep commitment to equity and justice, we can chart a course towards truly sustainable cities and communities – beacons of human ingenuity and resilience in an ever-changing world.
