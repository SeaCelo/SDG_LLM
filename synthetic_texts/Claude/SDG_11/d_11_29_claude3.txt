Sustainable Development Goal 11 – Making Cities and Human Settlements Inclusive, Safe, Resilient, and Sustainable – presents a multifaceted challenge for least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs). These nations face unique obstacles in their pursuit of urban sustainability, ranging from geographic constraints and limited resources to rapid urbanization and vulnerability to climate change.

In LDCs, such as Ethiopia, Malawi, and Bangladesh, the influx of rural-urban migration has outpaced the capacity of cities to provide adequate housing, infrastructure, and basic services. Informal settlements, characterized by overcrowding, lack of access to clean water and sanitation, and precarious living conditions, have become a ubiquitous feature of urban landscapes. These settlements are often located in areas prone to natural disasters, exacerbating the vulnerability of their residents and undermining efforts towards resilient urban development.

SIDS, like Fiji, Mauritius, and the Maldives, face the compounding challenges of limited land area, geographic isolation, and heightened susceptibility to the impacts of climate change, including sea-level rise, coastal erosion, and extreme weather events. These factors strain the capacity of SIDS to develop sustainable urban areas, as they grapple with limited resources, fragile ecosystems, and the need to balance economic growth with environmental conservation.

LLDCs, such as Laos, Mongolia, and Lesotho, confront unique obstacles in urbanization due to their lack of territorial access to the sea, which can impede trade, mobility, and access to global markets. This geographical disadvantage often translates into higher transportation costs, inefficient supply chains, and limited economic opportunities, hindering the potential for sustainable urban development and exacerbating poverty and inequality within cities.

Across these diverse contexts, several common challenges emerge. Inadequate urban planning and governance structures often lead to haphazard development, inefficient use of resources, and the marginalization of vulnerable populations. Limited access to affordable housing, public transportation, and green spaces further undermines the inclusivity and sustainability of urban areas.

Moreover, the impacts of climate change, such as rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and water scarcity, pose existential threats to urban settlements in LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs. These nations often lack the financial resources and technical capacity to implement effective adaptation and mitigation strategies, leaving their cities and populations increasingly vulnerable.

To address these challenges, a comprehensive and integrated approach is necessary, one that recognizes the interconnected nature of urban sustainability and the unique contexts of LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs.

Firstly, strengthening urban governance and planning frameworks is crucial. This includes developing robust urban policies, fostering inclusive decision-making processes, and promoting participatory approaches that engage local communities and stakeholders. Effective land-use planning, zoning regulations, and building codes can guide sustainable urban development, ensuring the efficient use of resources and the protection of fragile ecosystems.

Secondly, investing in resilient infrastructure and promoting sustainable urbanization is essential. This encompasses the development of affordable and energy-efficient housing, reliable public transportation systems, and the integration of green spaces and sustainable urban drainage systems. Such investments not only enhance the livability and resilience of cities but also create opportunities for economic growth and job creation.

Thirdly, addressing climate change adaptation and mitigation is paramount. This involves building the capacity of LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs to assess and manage climate risks, implement nature-based solutions, and promote sustainable energy transitions. Regional cooperation and knowledge-sharing platforms can facilitate the transfer of best practices and innovative solutions tailored to the unique contexts of these nations.

Fourthly, fostering partnerships and mobilizing resources is crucial. International cooperation, financial support, and technology transfer can catalyze sustainable urban development in LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs. Public-private partnerships, blended finance mechanisms, and innovative financing models can unlock additional resources and leverage the expertise of diverse stakeholders.

Finally, promoting social inclusion and addressing inequalities within urban areas is imperative. This includes ensuring equitable access to housing, basic services, and economic opportunities, as well as empowering marginalized communities and fostering their participation in decision-making processes.

By adopting a comprehensive and context-specific approach, LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs can navigate the intricate challenges of sustainable urbanization and create inclusive, resilient, and thriving cities. However, this journey requires sustained commitment, innovative solutions, and collaborative efforts from all stakeholders – local, national, and international – to achieve the transformative vision of SDG 11.
