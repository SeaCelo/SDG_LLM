Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), written from the perspective of the late economist Walter E. Williams:

The 11th Sustainable Development Goal set forth by the United Nations calls for making cities and human settlements "inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable." While the aims are admirable in their ambition, we must scrutinize the assumptions and mechanisms proposed with economic analysis and sober pragmatism. All too often, well-intentioned policies to improve urban development neglect the immutable laws of supply and demand, market pricing, and incentive structures.

The targets mention providing access to safe, affordable housing and upgrading slum dwellings. However, severe restrictions on urban development through zoning laws, building codes, and land-use regulations create artificial housing shortages that drive up prices and push the prospect of homeownership out of reach for millions. In many U.S. cities, permitting processes and bureaucratic red tape can delay new construction for years and add crippling costs. Economists have long understood that price ceilings cause shortages—this is Economics 101. Yet policymakers repeatedly ignore these teachings, imposing rent controls that disincentivize new investment and perpetuate the very housing crunches they aim to solve.  

The goal also calls for expanded public transit systems, conveniently overlooking the dismal record of inefficiency, waste, and billion-dollar boondoggles that plague government-run transportation projects. Public choice theory elucidates how such spending decisions are driven more by pork-barrel politics and rent-seeking from entrenched interests than genuine cost-benefit analysis. High-quality private transit, from ride-sharing services to efficient buses, often outperforms bureaucratic state-run operations. Moreover, history reminds us that some of the world's greatest transit systems, like early subways and extensive streetcar networks, were built not by city planners but private entrepreneurial ventures motivated by profit.

The targets mention participatory, integrated human settlement planning—but such top-down master plans are a recipe for the sort of urban renewing and disruptive "slum clearance" that decimated once-vibrant neighborhoods and severed the social fabric. As Jane Jacobs chronicled, heavy-handed government intervention often destroyed the intricate order and economic dynamism organically formed by market forces and human interaction over generations. City politicians and planners, unshackled from the discipline of market pricing and knowledge constraints, repeatedly succumbed to utopian conceit with tragic results.

Rather than empowering unelected bureaucracies, we should liberate cities by breaking up public monopolies and utility cartels that render basic services inefficient and unaffordable. Privatization, deregulation, and opening urban domains to market-entry and competition hold the keys to more affordable, higher-quality housing, transportation, and amenities. Private property rights and economic freedom consistently correlate with higher living standards across the world.  

International data reveal that the most affluent and livable urban centers emerge through economic liberty, not centralized plans.  The poor upgrading of their own housing happens not because of government decrees but via bottom-up market-driven development and access to capital. We must remember the wisdom of Adam Smith's invisible hand and Frédéric Bastiat's seen and unseen consequences—much of the greatest progress arises spontaneously, driven by human action but not design.  

Sustainability requires prices to convey accurate information about resource scarcity and environmental quality. When water, electricity, housing, and transit are appropriately priced by markets rather than distorted by government dictates, entrepreneurs find new ways to conserve, recycle, and create more efficient alternatives. Command economies that insulate consumers from real costs promote excessive consumption and waste. Well-defined property rights and free exchange encourage good stewardship and technological progress.

In the end, humanity's greatest breakthroughs—from the refrigerator to the iPhone—emerged not from UN diktats but through the market's decentralized trial-and-error experimentation. Our cities' most vexing issues cannot be solved by bureaucracies, no matter how lofty their stated goals. Only competition, property rights, and economic freedom can harmonize individual incentives with the public good and cultivate truly sustainable progress.
