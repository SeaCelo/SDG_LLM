The Black Sea Trade and Development Bank (BSTDB) recognizes the pivotal role of Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11) in shaping the future of our region's urban landscapes. As an institution dedicated to fostering economic cooperation and prosperity across the Black Sea region, we are acutely aware of the intertwined nature of sustainable cities, communities, and economic growth.

The rapid urbanization witnessed across our member countries presents both challenges and opportunities. While cities serve as engines of economic growth and innovation, uncontrolled urban sprawl and inadequate planning can exacerbate socio-economic disparities, strain public services, and contribute to environmental degradation. SDG 11 serves as a clarion call to address these pressing issues and ensure that our cities are inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable.

One of the core tenets of SDG 11 is the provision of adequate, affordable housing and basic services for all. This resonates deeply with our mandate, as access to decent housing is a fundamental human right and a critical component of socio-economic development. Across the Black Sea region, we have witnessed the consequences of urban migration and population growth, leading to the proliferation of informal settlements and substandard living conditions. Addressing this challenge requires a multi-faceted approach that encompasses urban planning, policy reforms, and strategic investments in housing and infrastructure.

The BSTDB has actively supported projects that promote inclusive and sustainable urbanization. For instance, our financing facilitated the construction of high-quality, energy-efficient social housing units in Romania, providing affordable housing solutions for low-income families. Furthermore, our partnership with the municipality of Khmilnyk, Ukraine, enabled the modernization of the city's water supply and sewerage systems, ensuring access to clean water and improved sanitation for its residents.

Sustainable transportation is another critical aspect of SDG 11, as it not only enhances urban mobility but also contributes to reduced emissions and improved air quality. The BSTDB has collaborated with the Municipality of Lviv, Ukraine, to co-finance the acquisition of eco-friendly, low-emission buses, promoting a modal shift towards public transportation and reducing the city's carbon footprint.

Recognizing the intrinsic link between urbanization and environmental sustainability, the BSTDB has actively supported projects that prioritize green spaces, urban biodiversity, and climate resilience. Our cooperation with the Municipality of Varna, Bulgaria, facilitated the revitalization of the city's iconic Sea Garden, preserving a valuable green space and enhancing its recreational and cultural value for residents and visitors alike.

Furthermore, we acknowledge the pivotal role of urban governance and participatory decision-making in achieving sustainable urban development. The BSTDB has actively supported capacity-building initiatives that empower local authorities and stakeholders to engage in inclusive and participatory urban planning processes. Our collaboration with the City of Chisinau, Moldova, has focused on enhancing the city's strategic planning capabilities, enabling evidence-based decision-making and fostering citizen engagement in shaping the city's future.

As we look towards the future, the BSTDB remains steadfast in its commitment to supporting SDG 11 and promoting sustainable urbanization across the Black Sea region. We recognize that achieving this ambitious goal requires a concerted effort from all stakeholders, including governments, private sector actors, civil society organizations, and international development partners.

Through our financing activities, technical assistance programs, and policy dialogue, we strive to catalyze transformative change in our member countries' urban landscapes. By prioritizing inclusive, resilient, and sustainable urban development, we can unlock the full potential of our cities as drivers of economic growth, social progress, and environmental stewardship.
