Here's a long academic article about SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), written in the humorous and satirical style of Dave Barry:

Make Cities and Stuff Better: A Totally Serious Look at SDG 11

Listen up, people. We need to talk about cities. You know, those big concrete jungles where everybody lives and works and gets stuck in traffic for hours because the urban planning wizards decided having only two lanes was a genius idea. Somebody clearly forgot to spend a weekend binge-watching road construction reality shows on HGTV.

But I digress. The goal here, according to some bureaucrats at the UN who clearly have way too much time on their hands, is to make cities "inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable." Which sounds very impressive until you realize they're basically saying: "Let's try not to screw this up too badly."

Now, I'm no expert on sustainable urban development (unless you count that time I unsuccessfully petitioned my city council to install a Slip'N Slide at every major intersection), but I've spent enough time in cities to know they're kind of a mess. Traffic is nightmarish, affordable housing is a pipedream, and don't even get me started on the lack of well-maintained public karaoke booths.

The first step, according to the brainiacs at the UN, is to make cities inclusive and accessible for all, including persons with disabilities, women, children, and...hmm, I could've sworn there was another group they mentioned. Seniors? Nope. Circus performers? Nah, that can't be right. Oh well, I'm sure it'll come back to me.

Next up is affordable housing, which is apparently a real problem in some cities. Who knew, right? You'd think with all those tiny, surgically-enhanced living spaces marketed as "cozy urban lofts," the housing crisis would be solved by now. But I guess people still want things like "windows" and "reasonably sized closets" and "a bathroom you don't have to contort yourself into a human pretzel to use."

Then there's the whole "sustainable" aspect, which loosely translates to "not screwing over the environment so badly that our grandkids will have to live in biodomes and subsist on a diet of algae shakes." Seems like a smart move, even if it does involve phrases like "emissions reduction" and "renewable energy sources" that make my eyes glaze over faster than a Krispy Kreme behind bulletproof glass.

But hey, at least the UN has a plan for sustainable cities that absolutely nobody will follow or take seriously. Because honestly, when is the last time a committee of diplomats and policymakers put together a totally realistic and implementable global agenda? My money's on...never, but I'm happy to be proven wrong.

In the meantime, I'll be over here, dreaming of a future where my self-driving car can take me from the holographic karaoke lounge directly to the algae shake dispensary without having to sit in soul-crushing traffic. A guy can dream, right?
