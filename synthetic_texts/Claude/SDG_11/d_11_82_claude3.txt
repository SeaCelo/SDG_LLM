The Struggle for Sustainable Cities: Aspiration vs Reality  
By Bachi Karkaria

As an urban journalist for over three decades, I've witnessed the paradoxical trajectory of our cities - hubs of economic growth, innovation and opportunity, but also reservoirs of deepening inequalities, environmental degradation and social fractures. The 2030 Agenda's Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11) represents a bold vision to "make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable." Yet, the gulf between this aspiration and ground reality remains dauntingly vast. 

Our cities have been the engines of national progress, a truth underscored by their economic primacy - India's urban areas generate over 63% of the GDP despite housing merely a third of the population. Metropolitan hubs like Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore and Kolkata are crucibles of entrepreneurship, employment magnets and nerve centers of global capital flows. They are the embodied promise of a new India striding towards prosperity and modernity.

But scratch beneath this sheen of success, and an uglier truth emerges. Our urban agglomerations have become cauldrons of squalor, grime and dysfunction - a tale of two starkly disparate cities coexisting in uneasy disequilibrium. The gulf between the airy, genteel confines of the upper crust and the bleak, dystopian margins of the underclass has become a seemingly unbridgeable chasm.

In Mumbai, my native city, soaring glass-and-steel high-rises loom over sprawling slum labyrinths where overcrowding, lack of basic sanitation and public squalor have become permanent features of existence. Delhi's stunning Lutyens marvels and swanky gated colonies cast long shadows over the festering urban villages and polluted, trash-clogged badlands. In Bangalore, the Silicon Valley of the East, a burgeoning tech elite coexists awkwardly with vast low-income neighborhoods lacking basic amenities like clean water or paved roads.

This entrenched, multi-dimensional inequality – fueled by obscene wealth divides, exclusionary policies and lack of affordable housing – is arguably the biggest impediment to achieving SDG 11's vision of inclusive, equitable urbanization. Despite their economic muscle, cities like Mumbai have abysmally low scores on human development indices like life expectancy, literacy and living standards when disaggregated for informal settlements. Without concerted efforts to bridge these yawning chasms, our cities risk becoming increasingly Balkanized landscapes of privilege and squalor.

The environmental implications are no less dire. Relentless construction devouring green lungs, toxic air poisoning our children's tender lungs, plastic choking our waterways, mounting garbage crises – these have become defining images of urban India, a harrowing reality check behind the rhetoric of "smart" cities and sustainability. As hubs of consumption and waste generation, cities will remain environmental blight zones without radical interventions on waste management, public transport, green spaces and clean energy.

Public safety, too, emerges as an urgent priority, with cities increasingly becoming hotbeds of crime, sexual violence and traffic fatalities. Lack of policing resources, poor urban planning and crumbling civic infrastructure have engendered urban spaces that are increasingly hostile and hazardous for women, children and the underprivileged. The horrific 2012 Nirbhaya case became a tragic inflection point, spotlighting how gender-based insecurities severely restrict access to public spaces and economic opportunities.

Most crucially, climate change has amplified the vulnerability of cities perched precariously at the frontlines of this existential threat. From catastrophic flood events to searing heatwaves and pandemics like COVID-19, cities are increasingly becoming uninsurable risks in the climate age without concerted efforts on resilience and adaptive capacity. The doomsday images from 2021, of cars submerged in the submerged urban arteries of cities like Mumbai, capture the apocalyptic magnitude of this crisis.

Yet, amid the gloom, there remain sparks of hope and possibility. The national push for urban renewal through initiatives like the Smart Cities Mission, AMRUT and PMAY (though deeply flawed in conception and execution), have catalyzed crucial public investments in urban infrastructure like housing, mass transit and digital connectivity. Citizen-led movements – from the iconic Placemaking initiative in Bangalore to the #VoicesOfBombay campaign – have galvanized communities to reclaim urban commons and reshape cities through democratic participation.

Ultimately, the path to achieving SDG 11 lies in fundamentally reorienting our conception of urbanization from the current model premised on consumption, exclusion and resource extraction, towards a vision centered on sustainability, inclusion and circularity. This transition necessitates bold policy disruptions, innovative financing models, political will to tackle inequalities head-on, and authentic participation of communities currently relegated to the urban periphery.  Cities represent the world's greatest challenge and biggest opportunity in the 21st century – how we urbanize will essentially determine the sustainability and resilience of our planet and species.
