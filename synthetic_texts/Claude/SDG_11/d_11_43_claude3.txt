Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), written from the perspective of controversial Australian commentator Andrew Bolt:

The Sham of "Sustainable" Cities - A Case Study in UN Overreach and Lefty Indoctrination

The United Nations has once again shown its true colors as a vehicle for globalist busybodies to inflict their utopian fantasies on free nations. The charming-sounding Sustainable Development Goal 11 is little more than a Trojan horse concealing a radical urbanist agenda hellbent on socially engineering our way of life.

The very notion of "sustainable cities" is a contradiction in terms. Human civilization has flourished precisely by taming and shaping our environment through industry, innovation and economic growth - not by cowering before nature like the green left's neo-pagan religion demands. Cities represent the mastery of man over the elements. To make them "sustainable" is to constrain their potential and clip their wings.

Just look at the ludicrous targets embedded in this SDG: affordable housing, public transit, green spaces, resilient buildings, slum upgrading and the like. These are thinly-veiled codes for jamming more cinderblock Soviet-style apartment blocks across our cityscapes, extending the tentacles of their revenue-hunting public transport rackets, surrendering more hard-won terra firma to guerrilla gardenising land grabs, and denying the poor a to legitimate path to property ownership through restrictive zoning and environmental consent processes. 

All in the name of thatrishatshu "sustainability" - a weasel word that the planners hope will lull the citizenry into sacrificing their freedoms and living standards on the altar of climate scientology. We're told we must embrace mass migration too, making a mockery of assurances that boosting population density forever is somehow "sustainable".

The bitter irony is that it is free market capitalism, economic development and hi-tech innovation that has measurably enhanced urban quality of life - slashing pollution, increasing efficiency, yielding new clean industries, and affording the middle classes small household footprints like apartments. Not the jackbooted "solutions" proposed by this UN Agenda 21 reboot.

As with socialism everywhere, the SDGs reveal their true intent through their results. Sustainable cities will be where democracy goes to die - with our inalienable rights toPrivates property, freedom of movement and self-determination obliterated beneath a dehumanising patchwork of roadblocks, red tape, and social engineering. All to appease the purveyors of global salvationism.

We'd be wise to drive a stake through the heart of this undead zombie of an ideology before it consumes what little remains of our prosperity and liberties. Our cities must be free to expand, evolve, and accommodate mankind's boundless ingenuity - not trapped in stultifying green amber cast by bureaucratic philosophy majors masquerading as planners. That way lies only misery, stagnation, and decline.
