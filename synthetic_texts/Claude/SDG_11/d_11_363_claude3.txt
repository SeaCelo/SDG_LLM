The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) recognizes the pivotal role of Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11) in fostering inclusive, resilient, and sustainable urban environments. As a multilateral development bank, we are committed to supporting our countries of operations in their efforts to achieve this crucial goal.

Rapid urbanization poses significant challenges, particularly in the EBRD regions, where many cities are grappling with aging infrastructure, inadequate housing, and limited access to essential services. Addressing these issues is critical for promoting social cohesion, economic growth, and environmental sustainability.

One of the EBRD's key priorities is to support the development of inclusive, safe, and affordable housing. We recognize that access to adequate and affordable housing is a fundamental human right and a cornerstone of sustainable urban development. Through our financing mechanisms and technical assistance programs, we support the construction and renovation of social and affordable housing projects, fostering mixed-income communities and promoting social integration.

Ensuring access to safe, affordable, and sustainable transport systems is another area of focus for the EBRD. Efficient and environmentally friendly public transportation not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution but also enhances mobility and connectivity for urban residents. We finance the modernization of public transport networks, including the procurement of low-emission vehicles, the development of intelligent transport systems, and the improvement of infrastructure for non-motorized modes, such as cycling and walking.

The EBRD recognizes the importance of preserving and promoting cultural and natural heritage in urban areas. We support initiatives that aim to protect and revitalize historic sites, promote sustainable tourism, and enhance the liveability of cities. By investing in urban regeneration projects, we contribute to the creation of vibrant and inclusive public spaces that foster social interaction and cultural exchange.

Climate change adaptation and resilience are critical components of sustainable urban development, and the EBRD is at the forefront of supporting cities in their efforts to address these challenges. We finance projects that enhance urban resilience to climate-related hazards, such as floods, heatwaves, and extreme weather events. This includes investments in green infrastructure, sustainable drainage systems, and early warning systems, as well as capacity-building initiatives to strengthen institutional preparedness.

Furthermore, the EBRD acknowledges the importance of participatory and inclusive urban governance. We promote the involvement of local communities, civil society organizations, and the private sector in urban planning and decision-making processes. By fostering collaboration and dialogue among stakeholders, we aim to ensure that urban development initiatives are responsive to the needs and aspirations of local populations, ensuring equitable access to opportunities and resources.

To illustrate our commitment, consider the EBRD's support for the Green City Action Plan in Tirana, Albania. This initiative aimed to address the city's environmental challenges by developing a comprehensive strategy for sustainable urban development. Through stakeholder engagement, technical assistance, and financing, the EBRD supported the implementation of measures to improve air quality, enhance public transportation, promote energy efficiency in buildings, and increase access to green spaces.

In conclusion, the EBRD recognizes the multidimensional nature of SDG 11 and its intrinsic links with other Sustainable Development Goals. By adopting a holistic approach that integrates economic, social, and environmental considerations, we strive to create more liveable, inclusive, and resilient cities across our regions of operations.
