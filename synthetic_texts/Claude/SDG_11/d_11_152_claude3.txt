Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), written from the perspective of journalist Gail Collins:

When it comes to global goalposts for the 21st century, the folks at the United Nations didn't think small. Their Sustainable Development Goal 11 calls for making cities and human settlements "inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable" by the rather looming target date of 2030. 

Talk about ambition! We're supposed to transform the world's expanding metropolises — those overcrowded, traffic-choked, sky-high-renting, potholed parking lots for humanity — into civic utopias in less than a decade? I fear my colleagues in the media arenachronicling this process are going to have their hands full.

Still, I admire people who dream big. And given the rate at which the global population is urbanizing, with a million people moving into cities every single week, aiming high on improving urban quality of life is probably wise. The developing world is urbanizing at an even faster clip, which simultaneously presents opportunities for economic growth and daunting challenges like lack of affordable housing, inadequate infrastructure, and exposure to pollution and disasters.

So where do we start on the road to Sustainable City? Goal 11 lays out a fairly comprehensive to-do list: ensure access to affordable housing, investment in public transit, participatory urban planning, protection of cultural and natural heritage, disaster risk reduction strategies, reduction of environmental impacts like air pollution, and the provision of green public spaces. In other words, nothing too difficult — we just need to reinvent modern urban civilization as we know it!

One of the targets that jumps out is working to provide access to safe, affordable, and sustainable transport systems by 2030, with special attention to the needs of vulnerable populations like women, children, the elderly and disabled. Shifting away from car-centric cities towards public transit, biking, and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure could pay huge dividends for urban mobility, air quality, road safety, and climate mitigation. It's past time we designed cities for human beings instead of personal vehicles.

Making housing more affordable is another key focus. The data shows a pretty stark crisis looming, with around a third of the urban population globally living in informal settlements or slums lacking access to basic services. Upgrading slums while preventing the formation of new ones by incentivizing affordable housing construction has to be a top priority. Otherwise inequality and social unrest may become unavoidable biproducts of urbanization.

In the developed world, many cities are reinventing themselves as walkable, mixed-use, high-density urban villages. But we have our own challenges too, from suburban sprawl eating up green space and reinforcing car dependency, to aging infrastructure and the impacts of gentrification displacing lower-income residents. Balancing growth and revitalization while preserving community character is easier said than done.

Some promising signs I've seen: cities exploring land value capture to fund public transit and affordable housing. Urban farming and greenery initiatives bringing parks and food production into the concrete jungle. Public-private partnerships making creative use of underutilized spaces like parking garages. Apps and sensors making municipal services and utilities smarter and more responsive.

Yet reinventing cities is about more than just bricks, steel, and technology. It requires inclusive governance that actively engages all residents in urban planning instead of imposing top-down solutions. Goal 11 rightly emphasizes participation, protecting the rights of refugees, migrants, and internally displaced people to affordable housing. Celebrating and integrating diversity rather than forces of homogeneity and gentrification.  

My philosophy has always been that it's the people, not the buildings, that truly make a city vibrant and livable. The sustainable city of the future needs to be designed not just for resilience against climate shocks and flexibility to accommodate growth, but also for community, culture, and human connection to truly thrive.

Achieving all this by 2030 is wildly optimistic. But the audacity of Goal 11 reflects the importance of getting urbanization right as the mega-trend redefining the human experience this century. Let's get to work on building cities that are equitable, innovative, and sustainable — that treat our streets, parks, and public spaces as community assets to nurture the social and civic fabric that binds us together. Our cities will never be utopias, but with smart policies and a humanistic vision, we can at least make them feel like home.
