Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), written from the perspective of Jonah Goldberg:

The Mirage of "Sustainable" Cities

By Jonah Goldberg

The concept of sustainable cities and communities has become a fashionable buzzword among urbanists, environmentalists, and the international bureaucratic class. Enshrined in the UN's Sustainable Development Goals as SDG 11, it represents the latest utopian vision being peddled by those who fancy themselves grand visionaries and social engineers. At its core, SDG 11 betrays a fundamental conceit - that cities can be shaped, controlled, and rendered sustainable through top-down planning and global governance.

This entire endeavor rests on faulty premises from the outset. The very notion of urban "sustainability" is a mirage, a chimera that dissolves upon closer inspection. Cities are, by their nature, vast centers of human activity, consumption, and resource extraction. They are monuments to mankind's ingenuity and productivity, but also to our appetites and environmental footprints. To expect that the relentless dynamics of urbanization can be freeze-framed into a "sustainable" stasis through human intervention is naive at best.

Indeed, the entire framework of the SDGs embodies the intellectual arrogance and hubris that has plagued such ambitious social engineering projects throughout history. Just as the ill-fated urban renewal programs of the 20th century sought to remake cities according to the imagined ideals of planners and bureaucrats, SDG 11 envisions a future where cities conform to a rigid, externally-imposed vision of what is deemed "sustainable." This top-down approach treats cities as blank slates, ignoring the complex, organic, and decentralized forces that truly shape the evolution of urban areas.

At the heart of this folly lies a profound distrust of free peoples and free markets. The mandates for "sustainable" urbanization, with all their regulatory tentacles and bureaucratic diktats, represent a desperate attempt to wrestle control away from the very inhabitants who breathe life into cities. This is the antithesis of true sustainability, which can only emerge organically from the bottom-up choices and innovations of those who actually live, work, and thrive in urban environments.

The proponents of SDG 11 would have us believe that a masterplan hatched in the hallowed halls of the UN can somehow harmonize the wildly disparate needs, values, and circumstances of the world's multitudinous cities. This presumes a level of omniscience that has eluded even the most brilliant urban planners throughout history. Cities are not static museums to be curated and preserved, but dynamic, ever-evolving ecosystems that defy rigid blueprints and one-size-fits-all solutions.

Rather than striving for the quixotic dream of "sustainable" cities, we would be better served by empowering the very people who make cities thrive. By unleashing the creative potential of entrepreneurs, innovators, and local communities, we can foster genuine progress towards more livable, efficient, and prosperous urban centers. This requires not more top-down control, but less â€“ easing the regulatory shackles that stifle human ingenuity and trusting in the power of free markets to drive innovative solutions.

The siren song of "sustainable" cities is seductive, promising a world of urban utopias where humanity lives in harmonious balance with nature. But like so many grandiose visions of social engineering, it is destined to founder on the rocks of reality. True sustainability cannot be imposed from above, but must emerge organically from the choices and actions of free peoples pursuing their own visions of progress and prosperity. It is time to abandon the mirage of centrally-planned "sustainable" cities and embrace the dynamism and resilience of human freedom.
