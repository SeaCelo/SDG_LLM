Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), written from the perspective of conservative commentator Mark Steyn:

The Ruinous Folly of Agenda 2030's Sustainable Cities Utopia

By Mark Steyn

Much has been made of the United Nations' grandiose Sustainable Development Goals and their supposed urgency to save the planet from climatic calamity, rising inequality, and other imagined existential bogeymen. But none is more pernicious or downright diabolic than SDG 11, which promotes the development of so-called "sustainable cities and communities." This is nothing more than a Trojan horse for the imposition of a totalitarian green police state under the guise of urban planning.

The very notion of a "sustainable city" is an oxymoron of the highest order. Cities are, by their nature, vast human hives of commerce, industry, and energy consumption. They are the anthills of capitalism, not some harmonious eco-paradise. To suggest cities can somehow be rendered "sustainable" through statist diktat is the height of arrogant human hubris against the natural order. 

The unelected busybodies at Agenda 2030 would have us believe that benevolent planners can perfect society by herding the masses into dense urbanized blocks, separated from rural productive zones. This top-down Stalinist vision of micro-apartments, urban farming, and mandated use of mass transit reeks of the worst kind of social engineering and environmental puritanism.

The agenda's specific targets reveal the true danger. We're told housing must be made "affordable" through unspecified means—which is simply code for forcible government seizing and redistribution of private property. We're promised "access to safe, inclusive green public spaces"—newspeak for denying citizen access to vast tracts of land, all in the name of preventing so-called "urban sprawl." Citizens will effectively be imprisoned in their urban pods, with restricted movement allegedly for the greater environmental good.

Worst of all is the plan's promise to "enhance inclusive and sustainable urbanization." This harmless-sounding phrase is in fact a recipe for the destruction of the indigenous cultures, traditions, and social fabric that organically emerge in localized communities over generations. The UN's top-down urban planning Nazis preach "diversity" while their policies achieve the exact opposite—the homogenization of human settlement into a gray ecotopian uniformity.

Of course, the vaunted "city leaders" taking marching orders from the UN don't actually live in the cinderblock human storage facilities they're so eagerly constructing for the peasantry. Just as in all other socialist utopias, a ruling class of hypocritical eco-lites will be exempted from the very constraints they inflict on the masses, carrying on their conspicuous consumption and jetting across the globe to preach the virtues of immobility.  

Make no mistake—the push for "sustainable cities" has nothing to do with protecting the environment, and everything to do with centralizing control, minimizing human freedoms, and instituting a new craven form of feudalism with the UN petty sovereigns as our unelected overlords. The fortressed urbanity envisioned by SDG 11 is the gated community writ large, in which we are all prisoners gestating in our loftiest open-air prisons.

It's not too late to reject this megalomaniacal scheme before it further strangles human liberty and prosperity in the name of reifying some deranged climate theology. For the sake of preserving our Western civilization's greatest triumphs and the advances of the Enlightenment, we must defiantly resist the green doomsayers and render their Utopian urban hellholes unsustainable once and for all.
