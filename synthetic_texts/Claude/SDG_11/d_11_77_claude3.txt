Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), written from the perspective of Margaret Wente:

The Unsustainable Path of Urban Utopias

By Margaret Wente

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 11 beckons us with an alluring vision: to "make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable." It's a noble ambition, driven by an almost religious zeal for urban utopianism. But like most utopian projects, it is grounded more in wishful thinking than reality.

The world is undergoing the largest wave of urban migration in human history. According to the UN, an additional 2.5 billion people will move to cities by 2050, with 90 percent of this influx concentrated in Africa and Asia. Inevitably, the result will be explosive growth of slums, informal settlements, and concentrations of poverty. Urbanization has become virtually synonymous with the mass production of human misery.

Many affluent countries like Canada have entirely lost control of their housing markets, which have devolved into speculative playgrounds for the global 1%. Skyrocketing real estate costs and rock-bottom vacancy rates have put affordable housing grievously out of reach. Homelessness and housing insecurity, once problems confined to the margins, have become mainstream. For millions, renting or owning a home is no longer a realistic aspiration. So much for inclusivity.

Even as gleaming condo towers soar skyward, widening inequality and social dysfunction are eating away at our civic foundations. Gentrification has accelerated the balkanization of our cities into rich and poor enclaves. Divisive identity politics and culture wars are stoked by the tribalization of the urban landscape. Crime, polarization, alienation and fragmentation are on the rise. Hardly the recipe for sustainable, inclusive communities.

Then there are the compounding threats of climate change. While urban density is often touted as an environmental virtue over suburban sprawl, the truth is that hyperdense vertical cities are incredibly carbon-intensive, resource-voracious, and completely unsustainable as currently designed and constructed. Buildings made primarily of concrete and steel have appalling environmental footprints. Combine inefficient energy use with the heat-island effect, and large cities become ovens that cook themselves.

The idea that urban living is a low-carbon lifestyle is one of the great environmental delusions of our time. Existing cities will have to be almost entirely rebuilt with new materials and technologies to have any hope of being sustainable. But there's no money and no appetite to do it.

Utopian visions of compact, walkable, transit-friendly, green cities collide with the unpleasant realities of NIMBYism, zoning restrictions, crumbling infrastructure deficits, and construction costs driven haywire by greed, over-regulation and labor shortages. How many of our great urban renaissances have been aborted by dysfunction and dysfunction?

All these challenges cascade upon the developing world where the megacities of the future are emerging in chaotic expansion, ungoverned by any coherent planning authority. Cities across Africa and South Asia are being hollowed out by social and environmental catastrophes.

There's no shortage of global commitment to ideals like resiliency, sustainability, green public spaces and participatory planning. But the gap between those noble goals and the anarchic reality on the ground has never been wider. That's the fundamental contradiction at the heart of SDG 11.

Grand plans to make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable sound wonderful in theory. In practice, we're doubling down on a doomed model of urbanization that amounts to a world of stratospheric inequality, environmental devastation and civic breakdown writ large. Our modern cities are looking less like utopias than dystopias.
