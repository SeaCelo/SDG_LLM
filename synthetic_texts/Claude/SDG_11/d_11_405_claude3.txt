The Sustainable Development Goal 11, which aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable, is a critical objective that aligns closely with the mission and values of the Center for Victims of Torture (CVT). As an organization dedicated to healing the wounds of torture and promoting human rights, CVT recognizes the profound impact that urbanization and the built environment can have on the well-being and resilience of individuals and communities, particularly those affected by conflict, violence, and displacement.

The rapid urbanization witnessed globally has led to the proliferation of informal settlements, slums, and overcrowded living conditions, which often lack basic services, adequate housing, and infrastructure. These environments not only perpetuate the cycle of poverty and marginalization but also heighten the risk of exploitation, abuse, and violence, including torture. Individuals and families fleeing conflict zones or seeking refuge from persecution frequently find themselves in such precarious circumstances, exacerbating their vulnerability and trauma.

Furthermore, the lack of inclusive and participatory urban planning processes can lead to the exclusion and marginalization of specific groups, including refugees, internally displaced persons, and survivors of torture. These communities, already grappling with the psychological and physical scars of their experiences, face additional barriers to accessing essential services, employment opportunities, and social support networks, hindering their recovery and integration into host communities.

Addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach that recognizes the intrinsic link between sustainable urbanization and the protection of human rights. CVT's expertise in trauma-informed care and its commitment to promoting healing and resilience can contribute significantly to achieving SDG 11 by advocating for inclusive and participatory urban planning processes that prioritize the needs and voices of vulnerable populations.

One critical aspect of this effort is ensuring that urban infrastructure and services are designed and implemented with a trauma-informed lens, taking into account the unique needs and sensitivities of survivors of torture and other forms of violence. This may involve incorporating principles of trauma-informed design in housing, public spaces, and community facilities, as well as ensuring access to mental health and psychosocial support services within these environments.

Additionally, CVT can play a crucial role in promoting safe and inclusive public spaces, particularly for marginalized groups such as refugees, internally displaced persons, and survivors of torture. By collaborating with local authorities, urban planners, and community organizations, CVT can advocate for the creation of welcoming and accessible public spaces that foster social cohesion, cultural exchange, and community-building, thereby supporting the integration and resilience of these vulnerable populations.

Furthermore, CVT's expertise in capacity-building and training can be leveraged to equip urban planners, policymakers, and service providers with the necessary skills and knowledge to understand and respond to the unique needs and experiences of survivors of torture and other forms of violence. This could involve developing and implementing trauma-informed urban planning policies, guidelines, and best practices that prioritize safety, accessibility, and inclusivity.

Importantly, CVT's work in this context must be grounded in a human rights-based approach, ensuring that the voices and lived experiences of survivors of torture and other forms of violence are centered in the decision-making processes related to urban planning and development. By fostering meaningful participation and empowerment, CVT can contribute to creating urban environments that promote healing, resilience, and the realization of human rights for all.

In conclusion, the achievement of SDG 11 is inextricably linked to the protection and promotion of human rights, particularly for vulnerable populations affected by conflict, violence, and displacement. CVT's unique expertise and commitment to healing and resilience position the organization as a valuable partner in realizing inclusive, safe, and sustainable cities and human settlements that prioritize the well-being and dignity of survivors of torture and other forms of violence.
