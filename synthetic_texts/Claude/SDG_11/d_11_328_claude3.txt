The Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, through its Development Cooperation Programme, has long recognized the pivotal role of Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11) – Sustainable Cities and Communities – in shaping a prosperous and equitable future for all. As a nation with a rich urban legacy, Italy understands the intrinsic link between sustainable urbanization, socio-economic development, and environmental preservation.

Italy's efforts towards achieving SDG 11 are multifaceted, encompassing a range of initiatives designed to foster inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities and human settlements. One notable area of focus is the promotion of integrated urban planning and management. Through collaborative partnerships with local authorities and civil society organizations, Italy supports the development of comprehensive urban plans that prioritize sustainable land use, efficient resource management, and the preservation of cultural heritage.

Recognizing the pivotal role of urban transportation in shaping sustainable cities, Italy has actively invested in the modernization and expansion of public transit systems. By prioritizing low-emission and energy-efficient transportation modes, such as electric buses and light rail networks, Italian development cooperation aims to reduce urban air pollution, mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, and enhance mobility for all citizens, including those with disabilities.

Access to adequate, safe, and affordable housing remains a pressing challenge in many urban areas worldwide. Italy's development cooperation efforts have addressed this issue through initiatives that promote inclusive and participatory urban planning processes. By engaging local communities and leveraging innovative financing mechanisms, such as public-private partnerships, Italy supports the construction of affordable housing units that meet international standards for safety, resilience, and energy efficiency.

Resilient infrastructure is a cornerstone of sustainable urban development, and Italy has made significant contributions in this domain. Through technical assistance and capacity-building programs, Italian development cooperation supports the adoption of risk-informed urban planning and design practices, incorporating measures to enhance resilience against natural disasters, climate change impacts, and other shocks and stresses.

Recognizing the importance of inclusive public spaces in fostering social cohesion and economic vitality, Italy has prioritized the revitalization and preservation of urban green spaces, plazas, and pedestrian zones. By promoting inclusive and participatory design processes, these initiatives aim to create vibrant, accessible, and culturally significant public spaces that cater to the needs of diverse urban communities.

Furthermore, Italy's development cooperation efforts have embraced the principles of circular economy and sustainable waste management as critical components of sustainable urbanization. Through knowledge-sharing initiatives and technology transfers, Italian expertise is disseminated to support the implementation of integrated waste management systems, promoting waste prevention, recycling, and resource recovery in urban areas.

Recognizing the inextricable link between sustainable urbanization and climate action, Italy has actively supported initiatives that promote urban climate resilience and mitigation efforts. This includes supporting the development of urban climate action plans, facilitating access to climate finance mechanisms, and promoting the adoption of nature-based solutions and green infrastructure to enhance urban ecosystems and mitigate the urban heat island effect.

Italy's commitment to SDG 11 extends beyond its national borders, as the country actively participates in global platforms and partnerships aimed at fostering sustainable urbanization. Through multilateral initiatives and knowledge-sharing networks, Italy contributes its expertise and lessons learned, while also benefiting from the experiences and best practices of other nations and organizations.

In conclusion, Italy's Development Cooperation Programme, guided by the principles of SDG 11, is actively shaping a more sustainable and equitable urban future. Through collaborative partnerships, innovative approaches, and a holistic understanding of the interconnected challenges facing cities, Italy is contributing to the creation of inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable human settlements – a cornerstone of global sustainable development.
