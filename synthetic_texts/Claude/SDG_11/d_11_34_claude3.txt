The Sustainable Development Goal 11 – "Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable" – is a critical agenda for the global community, particularly for least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs). These nations face unique challenges in urbanization and sustainable development, exacerbated by their geographical, socio-economic, and environmental vulnerabilities.

In LDCs, rapid urbanization often outpaces the capacity of governments to provide adequate housing, infrastructure, and basic services. Overcrowding, informal settlements, and lack of access to safe drinking water, sanitation, and waste management systems are widespread issues. Furthermore, weak governance, limited financial resources, and a dearth of technical expertise hinder the implementation of sustainable urban planning and development strategies.

SIDS confront additional challenges due to their remote locations, limited land area, and exposure to climate change impacts such as sea-level rise, coastal erosion, and extreme weather events. Urbanization in these countries is often concentrated in coastal areas, exacerbating the risk of natural disasters and environmental degradation. Moreover, the high cost of importing construction materials and the limited availability of fresh water and energy resources pose significant obstacles to sustainable urban development.

LLDCs face unique transportation and connectivity challenges due to their lack of direct access to seaports, which increases trade costs and hinders economic growth. Urbanization in these countries is often driven by rural-to-urban migration, leading to rapid population growth in cities and straining existing infrastructure and services. Additionally, LLDCs often rely heavily on natural resource extraction, which can contribute to environmental degradation and unsustainable urban development patterns.

To address these challenges, UNCTAD advocates for a multi-dimensional approach that integrates economic, social, and environmental considerations. Strengthening urban governance and institutional capacity is crucial, particularly in areas such as urban planning, land management, and resource mobilization. Innovative financing mechanisms, including public-private partnerships and blended finance, can help bridge the investment gap for sustainable urban infrastructure and services.

Promoting inclusive and participatory urban planning processes is essential to ensure that the needs and perspectives of marginalized communities, including informal settlers, women, and indigenous populations, are adequately addressed. Empowering local governments and engaging civil society organizations can foster community-driven solutions and enhance the social sustainability of urban development initiatives.

Addressing the unique challenges faced by LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs requires tailored interventions. For LDCs, capacity-building programs and knowledge-sharing platforms can support the development of effective urban governance frameworks and sustainable urban planning practices. In SIDS, climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies must be integrated into urban development plans, while also promoting sustainable tourism and the blue economy. LLDCs require investments in transportation and logistics infrastructure to enhance regional connectivity and facilitate trade, as well as support for diversifying their economies beyond resource extraction.

Innovative technologies and approaches, such as sustainable building materials, renewable energy solutions, and smart city initiatives, can play a pivotal role in promoting sustainable urbanization across these countries. However, technology transfer and capacity-building efforts must be accompanied by efforts to address digital divides and ensure inclusive access to these technologies.

Cross-sectoral collaboration and multi-stakeholder partnerships are essential for achieving SDG 11. Governments, international organizations, the private sector, civil society, and academia must work together to develop integrated solutions that address the complex challenges of sustainable urbanization. Regional cooperation and knowledge-sharing platforms can facilitate the exchange of best practices and promote South-South and triangular cooperation.

In conclusion, achieving sustainable cities and human settlements in LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique socio-economic, environmental, and geographical challenges. By leveraging innovative financing mechanisms, promoting inclusive urban governance, investing in resilient infrastructure, and fostering cross-sectoral collaboration, these countries can pave the way for sustainable urbanization and ensure that no one and no place is left behind.
