Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), written from the perspective of prominent Canadian columnist Andrew Coyne:

The Pursuit of Urban Utopia: Vision vs Reality in Sustainable City Planning

By Andrew Coyne

The allure of perfectly planned, ultra-efficient "smart cities" has captivated technocrats and urban planners for decades. Sustainable Development Goal 11 - "Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable" - is the latest expression of this seductive urban utopian vision. But can harmoniously designed cities of the future really deliver on their lofty promises?

At first glance, the goals sound unimpeachable: affordable housing, inclusive public spaces, participatory planning, safeguarding cultural heritage, reducing environmental impact, and so on. Who could object to such benevolent aims? And yet, embedded within this sleek, hyper-rationalized conception of the ideal city lurks an insidious paternalism.

The smart city dogma presumes an epistemic arrogance - that top-down central planning can anticipate and resolve all of the "wicked problems" endemic to the urban condition. It is premised on the hubris that urban complexity can be tamed, micro-managed, and optimized through sufficiently brilliant design.

This is the same seductive gambit that has ensnared social engineers across the ages. From the "urban renewers" who demolished thriving neighborhoods, to the high-modernist architects who crammed residents into monumental housing projects - all conceived with utopian zeal but blind to organic, bottom-up order. The conceit that urban life can be administered from on high is a dangerous temptation.

The great achievement of Jane Jacobs was to remind us that successful cities are not sterile showpieces but raucous, chaotic hubs of human endeavor. The diversity, density, and serendipity of the urban whirl is the source of their vitality - not something to be imposed, but emergent properties to be nurtured. Central planning and zoning more often smother than cultivate that ineffable spark.

Standardized, one-size-fits-all solutions ignore the varied histories, cultural contexts, and lived experiences of place. Indigenous settlements, historic towns, rural villages - these intricate, vernacular lifeways are endangered by a globalizing vision of urban homogeneity. Is this really what we mean by "inclusive"?

Nor can we neglect the underside of the smart city proposition: the specter of pervasive surveillance, social control, and dehumanizing efficiency. In their purported seamlessness, optimized "smart" cities become closed-loop systems - frictionless, predictable, and devoid of surprise. The aleatory potential that defines urban existence is filtered out as noise. Residents are reduced to data streams, their behavior anticipatively managed.

The paradox is that, from a distance, the totality of complex human settlement can appear almost machinelike - a great churning, interdependent mechanism. Up close, however, the city is a roiling tide of spontaneous improvisation precisely for lacking any unified coordination. Impose centralized order on that entropic cauldron, and you lose its essential character.

Cities are generative forces precisely because they are imperfect, inefficient, and to some extent ungovernable. The greatest cities facilitate serendipity, perpetual flux, and productive disarray from which innovation continually emerges. Like vibrant mixed neighborhoods, the most sustainable cities are best shaped not by overarching blueprints but by accretion over time - the unscripted interplay of innumerable individual decisions.

Before enshrining sustainability as a global design agenda, let us ask what exactly we aim to sustain. Efficient resource use is critical, of course, as is resilience to climate impacts. But cities are more than just physical and infrastructural systems to be optimized. They are dynamic human ecologies, pulsing socio-cultural life-worlds best understood as spontaneous orders.

The paradox of planning is that by attempting to impose an ideal urbanism, we risk extinguishing the very generative capacity that makes great cities so vibrant and productive. Perhaps the most sustainable approach is to resist the totalizing conceit altogether. To humbly accept that the city's essence is and will forever remain partially opaque, impossible to fully administer or rationalize.

While aspects like infrastructure and services are amenable to purposeful design, in our quest for sustainable cities we must never lose sight of the unofficial processes, informal systems, and unplanned interactions that breathe life into the urban experience. To flourish, the smart city of the future must ultimately make room for improvisation, overlap, and even a little chaos.
