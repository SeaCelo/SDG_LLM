Here is a detailed newspaper article about Sustainable Development Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), written from the perspective of Fast Company magazine:

Building the Cities of the Future: How SDG 11 is Shaping Urban Innovation

By mid-century, nearly 70% of the world's population will reside in citiesâ€”a staggering statistic that both inspires visionary thinking and sounds a clarion call for urgent action. The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 11 couldn't be timelier, acting as a blueprint to "make cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable." This ambitious initiative is sparking a revolution in how cities approach everything from housing and transportation to green spaces and disaster preparedness.  

At the vanguard of this urban metamorphosis is a cadre of civic leaders, urban planners, and social innovators who recognize that creating thriving, future-proof cities requires holistic, human-centered design thinking. They're pioneering novel solutions that upend longstanding assumptions about city life. Take Sidewalk Labs' trailblazing work in conceiving a "city from the internet up." Their proposed smart city development in Toronto goes beyond mere technology integration, envisioning mobility ecosystems, adaptable spaces, urban innovations for sustainability and affordability.

While futuristic metropolises capture our imagination, innovation is percolating in established cities too. Barcelona's revolutionary superblocks reclaim vast swaths of public space for pedestrians and greenery. By diverting cars to a perimeter road system, the city transformed dense neighborhoods into enviable semi-car-free zones. With similar ambition, Paris aims to create a "15-minute city," where amenities like schools, parks, stores, and offices are just a short walk or bike ride away for all residents.

Participatory urban planning has become de rigueur, with city leaders realizing top-down approaches are outmoded. In Mexico City, the government collaborated with a civic tech lab to crowdsource input for a new constitution, capturing insights from diverse neighborhoods. And in Buenos Aires, youth-led neighborhood meetups directly shaped the city's first Climate Action Plan. Cities have an unprecedented opportunity to elevate previously marginalized voices and build inclusive communities from the bottom up.

Beyond physical spaces, some cities are rethinking foundational infrastructure with circular economy principles. Amsterdam's doughnut-shaped Circular Economy roadmap strives to create an urban ecosystem that is regenerative by design. Greenhouse gas emissions are being ratcheted down while renewable energy, water recycling, and zero waste strategies move front and center. The Dutch capital is repurposing infrastructure, eliminating waste streams, and stimulating entrepreneurship to achieve prosperity without compromising the environment.

Of course, resiliency underpins any vision of sustainable cities. Urban areas from New York to Jakarta are stress-testing sea walls, revising evacuation protocols, and exploring ways to future-proof water and power grids against climate impacts. In Bangladesh, an innovative municipality installed portable flood-proof breeding areas to help river communities protect livestock. Such grassroots innovations show the resourcefulness needed to adapt to escalating climate risks.

With their unparalleled potential for innovation, cities stand at the fulcrum of achieving SDG 11 and securing humanity's shared urban future. From smart city districts and reimagined streetscapes to green infrastructure and participatory governance models, tomorrow's cities are taking shape in inspiring ways. As engines of economic growth and opportunity, cities have an outsized role in creating a sustainable world for generations to come. The revolution in urban transformation has begun.
