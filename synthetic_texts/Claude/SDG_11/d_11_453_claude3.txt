WaterAid, a leading international non-profit organization dedicated to ensuring access to clean water, sanitation, and hygiene, presents this analytical report on the progress and challenges associated with Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11): "Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable."

As the global population continues to surge, with an estimated 68% expected to reside in urban areas by 2050, ensuring sustainable and inclusive urbanization has become a paramount concern. SDG 11 recognizes the pivotal role that cities play in driving economic growth, social progress, and environmental sustainability.

One of the primary challenges in achieving SDG 11 lies in the rapid and often unplanned expansion of urban informal settlements, commonly referred to as slums or favelas. These densely populated areas lack adequate housing, basic services, and infrastructure, posing significant risks to the health, safety, and well-being of their inhabitants. Addressing this issue requires a multi-faceted approach that encompasses affordable housing initiatives, upgrading informal settlements, and promoting inclusive urban planning and governance.

Access to safe and affordable housing is a fundamental human right, yet millions of urban dwellers worldwide struggle to secure decent living conditions. Innovative solutions such as the promotion of sustainable building materials, energy-efficient designs, and inclusive financing mechanisms are crucial to addressing this challenge. Partnerships between governments, private sector entities, and civil society organizations can drive the development of affordable housing projects that meet the diverse needs of urban communities.

Sustainable urban mobility is another critical aspect of SDG 11. As cities continue to grow, the demand for efficient and environmentally friendly transportation systems intensifies. Investing in public transportation, promoting non-motorized modes of transport (such as walking and cycling), and integrating land-use and transportation planning can significantly reduce urban emissions, congestion, and air pollution, thereby improving the quality of life for city residents.

Resilience to natural disasters and climate change impacts is a pressing concern for urban areas worldwide. Many cities, particularly those located in coastal regions or along major waterways, are vulnerable to the effects of sea-level rise, flooding, and extreme weather events. Strengthening disaster risk reduction strategies, implementing early warning systems, and promoting ecosystem-based adaptation measures are essential for safeguarding urban communities and infrastructure.

Effective waste management is a crucial component of sustainable urbanization. As cities grow, so too does the volume of waste generated, posing significant environmental and public health risks. Implementing comprehensive waste management systems that prioritize reduction, reuse, recycling, and proper disposal is vital for mitigating these risks. Innovative approaches such as waste-to-energy technologies, community-based recycling initiatives, and the promotion of a circular economy can contribute to a more sustainable urban environment.

Achieving SDG 11 also requires fostering inclusive and participatory urban governance. Empowering local communities, particularly marginalized groups such as women, youth, and persons with disabilities, in decision-making processes related to urban planning and development is essential for ensuring that cities are equitable and responsive to the needs of all residents.

Partnerships and collaboration are crucial for realizing the vision of sustainable and inclusive cities. By leveraging the expertise and resources of diverse stakeholders, including national and local governments, international organizations, civil society groups, and the private sector, we can accelerate progress towards SDG 11 and create cities that are truly resilient, sustainable, and inclusive for all.
