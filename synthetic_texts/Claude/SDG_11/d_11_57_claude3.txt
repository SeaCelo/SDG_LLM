Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), written from the perspective of demographer and social commentator Bernard Salt:

Making Cities Livable: A Demographic Perspective on SDG 11 

As a keen observer of social trends and population movements, I've long been fascinated by the challenges and opportunities presented by urbanization. The relentless growth of cities worldwide represents one of the defining phenomena of the modern era. And with over half the world's population now residing in urban areas, ensuring these cities are sustainable, equitable, and livable has never been more critical. This is the heart of Sustainable Development Goal 11 – making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable.

At its core, SDG 11 reflects the fundamental truth that cities are ultimately defined by their residents. The built environment, infrastructure, and services all exist to enable and enhance human thriving within these dense population hubs. Too often, however, the priorities of urban planning have been technocratic, driven more by engineering imperatives than an understanding of how people truly live, work, and build communities.

Fortunately, we are witnessing a demographic awakening when it comes to urban design. There is a growing realization that creating livable cities requires a granular, almost anthropological insight into the lives, behaviors, and aspirations of diverse resident cohorts. This latest wave of urbanization isn't just about accommodating more people – it's about serving the distinct needs of millennials, families, aging populations, minorities, and countless other subgroups. 

The demographic makeup of a city powerfully shapes its cadence, energy levels, infrastructure burden, and collective personality. In cities with younger populations, like many of those in developing nations, the demand for employment, entertainment, public transport, and start-up ecosystems is paramount. Older cities must grapple with different priorities – healthcare services, mobility solutions, community engagement to prevent social isolation. Multicultural cities require an enlightened approach to public spaces, community services, and social cohesion. 

Pioneering cities like Copenhagen, Vancouver, and Melbourne have been at the vanguard of this resident-centric approach to urban planning and policy. They have confronted issues like affordable housing shortages, traffic gridlock, social exclusion, and environmental degradation through policies founded on deep insights about their populace. Everything from cycling infrastructure and childcare provision to green spaces and work hubs has been purposefully designed around how people truly live.

Indeed, the provision of adequate, affordable housing lies at the heart of SDG 11. Shelter is the primordial human need, and all too many cities are afflicted by a dearth of housing stock, overpopulated slums, distorted property markets, and entrenched homelessness. Smart cities are getting ahead of the curve through urban planning policies that encourage affordable, sustainable housing developments, public-private partnerships, and legislative reforms to tenancy and ownership laws.

Of course, even the most livable cities can be perilously vulnerable to external shocks – economic crises, extreme weather events, health pandemics. Enhancing urban resilience is therefore another key thrust of SDG 11's agenda. Cities must be proactive in areas like disaster preparedness, robust infrastructure and utilities, climate adaptation and mitigation, crime prevention, and social support networks. Cultivating strong community bonds and social capital is indispensable to withstanding turbulence.

As the world continues its inexorable march towards urbanization, the stakes could not be higher. Cities concentration of population, economic productivity, and resource consumption means their ecological footprint is immense. Car-centric urban sprawl, greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity loss, air pollution, and waste volumes all threaten the long-term sustainability and livability of cities worldwide. 

Yet within this challenge lies immense opportunity. Cities are also crucibles of innovation, progressive policymaking, green industries, and cultural evolution. If we can get urbanization right through principles like compact urban form, walkable neighborhoods, green buildings, renewable energy, and closed-loop waste systems, then cities can be the catalyst for planetary sustainability.

At a time of such profound disruption – from pandemics and climate change to demographic stress-tests and geopolitical realignments – it's apt that SDG 11 spotlights the importance of making cities resilient and future-proof. After all, it is the world's burgeoning city populations who will bear the brunt of these 21st century trials, while simultaneously being wellsprings of solutions. Cities are where the battle for a sustainable human civilization will be won or lost.

From the favelas of Rio to the global megacities of Tokyo, Lagos and Mexico City, cities mirror humanity itself – hardship and struggle co-existing with vibrant opportunity and perpetual reinvention. By resolving to make these urban expanses more inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable through policies grounded in demographic foresight, we aren't just honoring the lives of this generation's city dwellers. We are investing in the worldwide human habitats that will shape the fate and flourishing of generations to come.
