Here is a long academic article about SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), written from the perspective of Leonard Pitts, a renowned American commentator and author:

Sustainable Development Goal 11 - A Vision for Just, Inclusive and Resilient Cities

By Leonard Pitts

The challenge of sustainable urban development stands as one of the defining issues of our time. As the world's cities swell with an ever-increasing human tide, we find ourselves at a crossroads - one path leading towards a dystopian future of overcrowded slums, crumbling infrastructure and environmental degradation, the other beckoning us towards an urban renaissance defined by inclusivity, resilience and harmony with nature.  

The choice we make will echo across generations to come.

The United Nations' SDG 11 represents a bold, visionary framework aimed at nurturing livable cities and communities – places where all people can thrive in safety, affordability and dignity. Its targets call for universal access to adequate housing, sustainable transport systems, inclusive urbanization, protection of cultural/natural heritage, disaster risk reduction, and more.  

Implicit in this agenda is a profound rethinking of how we design, build and inhabit the urban spaces that have become the anthills of the human species in the 21st century. For too long, the prevailing models of city development have been shaped by short-term profiteering rather than long-term sustainability and equity.

The result? A proliferation of cities riven by inequality, with the wealthy segregated in enclaves of privilege while the poor are relegated to underserved, high-risk areas beset by inadequate housing, sanitation, mobility, public safety and environmental health. From the sprawling favelas of Brazil to the dingy tenements of Dhaka, urban marginalization has become a moral crisis on a global scale.

Thankfully, SDG 11 defies this age-old injustice by centering the human right to an adequate standard of living for all. It demands cities be built not as engines of exclusion and displacement, but as equitable communities where multi-generational families can lay down roots, cultural traditions are honored, and public spaces bloom with vibrancy.  

The pathway illuminated by SDG 11 prioritizes dense, transit-oriented development that reduces car dependency and urban sprawl. It calls for climate-resilient infrastructure and housing that withstands the escalating perils of floods, heatwaves and other extreme weather. It envisions cities rich in green spaces that serve as the lungs of the urban organism.

Underpinning this sustainable development paradigm is a powerful recognition: that cities are far more than just agglomerations of concrete, steel and glass. They are, at their core, expressions of the human experience, the canvases upon which the drama of civilization unfolds. Their forms should elevate the poetry of shared spaces and spontaneous connections, of art and architecture enmeshed with nature's choreography.

As humankind's greatest creations, cities deserve to be crafted not through the myopic pursuit of growth and extracted resources, but through a holistic understanding of how the built environment impacts human and environmental flourishing. Sustainable, resilient cities are living ecosystems that metabolize resources through restorative cycles, allowing their diverse residents to move, breathe, create and dream in symbiotic harmony.

SDG 11 reminds us that urbanization is not an imposed condition, but an unprecedented opportunity to manifest societies of true inclusion, opportunity and transcendent beauty. I can envision cities that are sculpted as humanistic masterpieces - vibrant cultural districts honoring indigenous heritage, thriving local economies rooted in circular production, resilient housing cooperatives fostering intergenerational solidarity.

Yet there can be no illusions about the immense challenges ahead. Vested interests, policy inertia and the seductive allure of unsustainable growth will vigorously resist this transformative urban agenda. Vast investments in equitable public services, clean energy and climate adaptation will be required.

Most critically, achieving the SDG 11 vision will demand a revolution of human consciousness. We must shed the blind, ego-driven impulses that have ravaged our planetary home and elevate the ethos of global solidarity and intergenerational stewardship. For in the end, the path to sustainable cities is also a path to sustainable souls.

So let this be the rallying call of an awakened humanity: that our cities no longer be cathedrals of alienation, but luminous sanctuaries where the human journey finds its highest expression and deepest reverence. This is the sublime truth echoing through SDG 11 – that in building just, sustainable and resilient cities, we are in fact building the better angels of our nature.
