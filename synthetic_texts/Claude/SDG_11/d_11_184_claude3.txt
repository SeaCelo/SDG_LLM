Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 11 on sustainable cities and communities, presented from the perspective of Dennis Prager:

There is perhaps no greater threat facing humanity than the unsustainable path of development undertaken by the world's cities and urban areas. As population growth continues unabated and more of the world's masses flock to cities chasing economic opportunity, the unbridled expansion and poor planning of human settlements poses an existential risk to our way of life. 

Already, we see the early manifestations of this urbanization crisis playing out in cities across the developing world. Overcrowding, lack of adequate housing, crippling traffic congestion, air pollution, crumbling infrastructure, rising poverty and inequality - these are just some of the woes plaguing the rapidly growing cities of Africa, Asia and Latin America. From the sprawling slums of Mumbai to the traffic-choked streets of Mexico City, the unchecked growth of these cities without proper foresight and sustainable planning has rendered them unlivable, their residents subjected to inhumane conditions utterly unbecoming of the modern era.

The developed world is not immune to these issues either. Even relatively well-planned cities in North America and Europe face immense strains as their aging infrastructure buckles under the pressures of growing populations and the emergence of new socioeconomic challenges. Gentrification, affordable housing crises, persistent pockets of urban poverty and decaying inner cities serve as stark reminders that sustainable urbanization requires steadfast commitment to proactive planning and upholding universal truths about community, judicious use of resources and respect for the environment.

At the root of the ubiquitous challenges facing cities worldwide is a fundamental disconnect between human civilization and its Judeo-Christian underpinnings. As humankind has drifted from its moral foundations, erected on the universal values of rationality and restraint as prescribed by the great philosophers and religious thinkers, we have embraced a culture of excess, greed and wanton exploitation of the earth's finite resources. Thisideological shift, fueled by human arrogance and hubris, is the genesis of our unsustainable path - the impetus behind the reckless overdevelopment of cities with little regard for prudent management or livability.

Returning to a sustainable trajectory requires cities to realign development practices with eternal truths. Time-honored principles of judicious urban planning rooted in human scale design, conservation of resources, environmental protection and community cohesion must be rediscovered and upheld. Every new project, new building, new community must be developed through the lens of how it enhances the human experience, not merely through the myopic prism of GDP growth and real estate profits.

Concurrently, we must rein in the human impulses of excess that drive overconsumption, waste and unchecked emissions. Left unbridled, these vices will only intensify the existential risks facing cities from climate change, pollution and dwindling natural resources needed to sustain human civilization. Embracing reason and temperance on an individual and societal level is essential to reversing the deeply troubling trajectories already set in motion.

Underpinning this entire paradigm shift is a restoration of the traditional family unit, a pillar of civilized society that nurtures moral consciousness from a young age. With strong families united around transcendent values and religious truths, younger generations will internalize sustainability principles that translate organically into sustainable lifestyles and mindsets. Re-established family values chains will thus fuel a grassroots movement powerful enough to compel cities toward sustainable development pathways.

Of course, affecting behavioral change on such a monumental scale will not be easy. Progress will face immense inertia and backlash from entrenched special interests profiting from the unsustainable status quo. Corporate greed, political corruption, ideological obstructionism and apathy will all threaten to derail efforts to create "Cities for Life" that realize the noble vision set forth by the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.  

Yet as daunting as the challenges may appear, we must not shrink from this moral calling. The human spirit contains boundless wells of fortitude and determination, as evidenced by the innumerable triumphs of faith and reason throughout history. If we rekindle the eternal wisdom of our Judeo-Christian ethos and harness it in service of sustainable cities, no obstacle is too formidable to overcome. The same values and code of conduct that built the great cities of antiquity and the modern world can guide humanity toward a brighter urban future.  

Achieving the transformative change prescribed by SDG 11 will be an inter-generational endeavor requiring steadfast commitment. But the Herculean effort is a moral imperative vital to human flourishing and existence in the face of grave and unprecedented threats. With fidelity to timeless truths and the courage to demand sustainable urban living, cities can once again become beaâ€‹cons of human civilization.
