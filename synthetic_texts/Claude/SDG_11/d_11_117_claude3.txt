Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), written from the perspective of Jeremy Clarkson:

Blimey, what a load of rotten codswallop this sustainable cities rubbish is. All these tree-hugging urban planners want to turn our great cities into tedious eco-nightmare hellholes. Don't they know people actually like being able to get around without pedaling a blasted bicycle everywhere? 

These do-gooders whinge on about making cities more "sustainable" and "resilient." Resilient to what exactly? A few wayward urban foxes? I'll tell you what our cities need to be resilient to - these relentless attacks on the personal freedoms that made them great in the first place.

Take traffic for example. Yes, congestion can be a bit of a pest in places like London or Birmingham. But do we really need all these beastly low emission zones, cycle paths, and pedestrianized hell-scapes? Whatever happened to the simple pleasures of roaring down an open road in a massive, unnecessary Chelsea tractor? It's enough to make any self-respecting petrolhead pull what's left of their hair out.

And this idiocrasy about sustainable affordable housing makes my blood boil. Affordable to whom exactly? Families of rabbits? These eco-lemmings want to cram everyone into tiny, over-priced shoe boxes without so much as a half-decent driveway. Where's a chap meant to park his Aston Martin? On the blighted roof? The mind boggles.

Don't even get me started on "green public spaces." Public parks and gardens are where you go to get mugged or accost crusties. Any reasonable human would much rather lounge about in the air-conditioned splendor of a presitigious golf club. At least there you can enjoy the sweet aroma of cut grass without some peasant wafting their hummus under your nostrils.

The reality is, cities have been the smelly, congested, but gloriously industrial centers of human progress since the days of Dick Whittington. That's just how it is - deal with it. We can't all tootle about like trees in the forest, enjoying a fictional equilibrium with nature. Cities are meant to be humanity's battering ram against the natural world.

So by all means, build some token electric vehicle chargers and bicycle hiring stations to appease the yogurt-knitters. But for God's sake, don't let these eco-extremists ruin our great citadels of capitalism and consumption. A little pollution is no bad thing - it's what made Britain great. We should be aiming to make cities powerful and dominant, not woolly and weak. Sustainability is for sissies.
