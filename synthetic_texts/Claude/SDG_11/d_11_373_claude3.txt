The International Red Cross recognizes that sustainable cities and communities, as outlined in Sustainable Development Goal 11, are pivotal to building a more equitable and resilient world. Our extensive field operations across diverse contexts have provided us with a nuanced understanding of the multifaceted challenges and opportunities associated with this goal.

Rapid urbanization, particularly in developing nations, has outpaced the capacity of many cities to provide adequate housing, infrastructure, and essential services. Informal settlements, often characterized by overcrowding, lack of basic amenities, and precarious living conditions, have become a harsh reality for millions. The absence of secure tenure and the constant threat of forced evictions exacerbate the vulnerability of these communities, perpetuating cycles of poverty and marginalization.

Compounding these challenges, the increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters and the adverse impacts of climate change disproportionately affect urban populations, particularly those residing in high-risk areas or substandard housing. Extreme weather events, such as floods, heat waves, and storms, have devastated communities, disrupted livelihoods, and strained already overburdened urban systems.

Recognizing the urgency of these issues, the International Red Cross has actively engaged in promoting inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable urban development. Our interventions span a range of initiatives, from disaster risk reduction and emergency response to community-driven slum upgrading and participatory urban planning.

In the aftermath of natural disasters, our teams have worked tirelessly to provide immediate relief, shelter, and essential services to affected urban populations. However, we have also prioritized long-term recovery and resilience-building efforts. By collaborating with local authorities, community organizations, and urban planners, we have advocated for risk-informed urban development strategies that integrate climate change adaptation measures and strengthen the capacity of communities to withstand and recover from shocks.

Furthermore, we have actively championed the principles of inclusive and participatory urban governance. Through our work in informal settlements, we have facilitated community-driven slum upgrading initiatives that empower residents to actively shape the development of their neighborhoods. By engaging with local stakeholders, we have fostered inclusive decision-making processes that prioritize the needs and aspirations of marginalized groups, ensuring that no one is left behind in the pursuit of sustainable urban development.

Recognizing the interconnectedness of SDG 11 with other global goals, the International Red Cross has adopted a holistic approach that addresses the multidimensional aspects of sustainable cities and communities. For instance, our efforts to promote safe and affordable housing are inextricably linked to improving access to basic services, such as water, sanitation, and healthcare, as well as creating economic opportunities and fostering social cohesion.

As we look ahead, the International Red Cross remains committed to supporting the global agenda for sustainable urban development. We will continue to leverage our extensive operational experience, local partnerships, and humanitarian expertise to drive innovative solutions and catalyze transformative change. By fostering resilient, inclusive, and sustainable cities and communities, we can pave the way for a more equitable and prosperous future for all.
