Here is a draft newspaper article about Sustainable Development Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), as if written for The Washington Post:

A Sustainable Future for the World's Cities

By 2050, over two-thirds of the global population will reside in urban areas, making the quest for sustainable cities one of the defining challenges of our era. The united nations' Sustainable Development Goal 11 aims to "make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable" - an imperative that will require transformative solutions across multiple fronts.

At the crux of this goal lies the notion that cities should be vectors of opportunity and prosperity for all, rather than vectors of inequality and degradation. Yet in many urban centers today, residents face a constellation of interrelated threats: unchecked sprawl, inadequate housing, traffic gridlock, hazardous pollution levels, crumbling infrastructure, rising poverty and social stratification.

"We can't continue building cities in a way that leaves millions marginalized and entire neighborhoods cut off from economic opportunity," said Karen Seto, a Yale geographer. "SDG 11 recognizes urbanization's potent capacity to accentuate societal divides when poorly managed." 

Experts emphasize holistic urban planning that embeds equity, environmental resilience and economic inclusion into the DNA of city development. This means investing in affordable housing stock integrated with public transit networks, ensuring equal access to green spaces, building resilience to climate change impacts like rising seas and extreme heat, and cultivating sustainability-aligned job growth sectors.

Some cities offer blueprints for this approach. In Medellin, Colombia, public transportation projects like cable cars and green railways have connected isolated hillside slums to the urban core's educational and economic opportunities. Copenhagen achieved a Renaissance-level reinvention by pedestrianizing its urban villages and encouraging biking, now accounting for over 60% of work commutes.

"The 'smart city' paradigm is more than just flashy technology," explains Sameh Wahba, global director of the World Bank's urban practice. "It's fundamentally rethinking the form, flow and functions of cities in a sustainble and inclusive way."

This requires mobilizing new financing models and public-private partnerships. Innovations like green municipal bonds, social impact investment vehicles, and multilateral development bank lending can unlock capital for transformative projects. Critically, these initiatives must incorporate community input and distribute benefits equitably to avoid exacerbating uneven development.

Ultimately, realizing SDG 11 requires cultivating a shift in the public consciousness. Instead of urban areas being perceived as loci of unchecked growth and inequality, they must be positioned as vibrant hubs of sustainable living and opportunity for all. With two-thirds of humanity projected to call cities home by mid-century, this is a existential imperative that will shape the fate and futures of generations to come.
