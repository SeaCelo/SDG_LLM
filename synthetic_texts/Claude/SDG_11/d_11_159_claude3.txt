Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 11 on sustainable cities and communities, written from the perspective of Thomas Friedman:

The Urbanization of Everything: How to Build Resilient, Inclusive Cities 

By Thomas L. Friedman

When I think about the challenge of sustainable development in the 21st century, nothing looms larger than the breakneck pace of urbanization we are witnessing across the planet. The world has experienced a great "re-lording" - as peasants fled rural areas over the last century, the global population re-clustered into cities, creating an urbanized world with all its complexities. This mass movement of people towards dense human settlement is the key force shaping development in our era.

We are now a predominantly urban species - over half the world's population resides in cities, and that proportion continues to grow rapidly. By 2050, it's projected that 7 out of every 10 people will be city dwellers. The populations of urban areas in Africa and Asia in particular are exploding. This staggering urbanization represents one of the biggest inflection points in modern history - a revolutionary reordering of human civilization on a scale unseen since the Neolithic transition to settled agriculture. 

The challenge before us is to successfully navigate this Urban Century - to channel these masses of people concentrating in cities in ways that promote sustainability, equity, resilience and shared economic progress. We need nothing less than a re-conception, re-engineering and re-building of cities themselves to align with sustainable development principles. How we urbanize will be the determining factor in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and shaping the fate of both people and planet.

In many ways, cities already embody the greatest promise and peril of sustainable development. They are radiant nodes of economic dynamism, creating over 80% of global GDP. The density of cities produces powerful agglomeration effects and economies of scale - diverse labor markets, knowledge spillovers, efficient sharing of resources and infrastructure. When cities are properly structured, nothing is more galvanizing for human potential and innovation. Great cities are catalytic crucibles that drive humanity forward.

Yet cities also concentrate poverty, pollution, inequality and heightened exposure to natural disasters in brutal ways. Overcrowded urban slums without basic sanitation reek of systemic policy failure. Poorly managed, disorderly urbanization sows the seeds of civic dysfunction - from gridlocked roads to compromised health to intensified climate vulnerabilities. Roughly 1 billion people today live in informal settlements and urban squalor without reliable access to electricity, clean water or adequate housing. That is 1 billion lives being crushed by deprivation in the midst of economic vibrancy.

These contrasting urban realities represent the competing gravitational forces tugging at sustainable development. The imperative of SDG 11 is to harness urbanization's enormous positive potential while neutralizing the toxic side effects. In short, we need to create cities that are inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable: durable engines of opportunity for all people while minimizing harmful environmental impacts.

Making cities more sustainable and future-proof involves tackling thorny, interconnected challenges across multiple dimensions - from affordable housing and public transportation to participatory urban planning and disaster preparedness. It requires holistically re-imaging cities as confluences of physical systems and digital capabilities - a meshwork of "human software" for governance and policies layered over "hardware" infrastructure and engineered environments. Above all, urban sustainability demands patient investments in human capital to build shared prosperity from the bottom up.

Financing is a major bottleneck. By some estimates, the world will need to invest $3.3 trillion annually towards sustainable urban infrastructure to accommodate the projected growth in urban populations by 2050. Fiscal constraints and budgetary gaps consistently hobble cities seeking to install mass transit systems, public spaces, efficient water utilities, resilient housing and other vital frameworks for sustainable communities. Overcoming chronic underinvestment in urban infrastructure, particularly in developing countries, will require both public and private capital, innovative funding pipelines, and multilateral cooperation between cities and financing partners.

Fundamentally though, sustainable cities are about people - ensuring every person is afforded the dignity and opportunity to thrive, while collectively safeguarding the ecological systems we all depend upon. This means inclusive cities that expand affordable housing and access to public services, even as the relentless crush of urbanization threatens to create entrenched zones of exclusion. It means resilient cities that stand bulwarked against the shocks of climate change, natural disasters and other systemic risks by investing in redundancies, upgrading informal settlements and implementing robust adaptation measures. And it means pioneering cities pioneering solutions to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation by transitioning to clean energy, designing efficient buildings, advancing green mobility options and implementing policies to reduce waste.

The cities that embrace these imperatives won't just be more livable, they will be forging a sustainable future for humanity itself. Because unless we rapidly reimagine human habitats as engines for regenerating societies and replenishing ecosystems, the accumulating collateral damage of unbridled urbanization could ultimately unravel the modern world we've spent centuries building.

Our modern era began with humans first congregating in cities and complex societies taking shape. But this Urban Century will be the most profound test yet of our species' ability to advance prosperity and opportunity without destroying nature's delicate equilibrium. Sustainable cities must become arks for carrying civilization into a resilient, equitable future on a survivable planet. In the end, SDG 11 distills into a unifying call for making urbanization itself an uplifting human achievement instead of a dark, dystopian endgame.
