Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), written from the perspective of Brendan O'Neill:

The Unsustainable Agenda Behind 'Sustainable Cities'

By Brendan O'Neill

The UN's Sustainable Development Goal 11 calls for making cities "inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable." On the surface, this seems reasonable â€“ who doesn't want safer, cleaner cities? However, upon closer inspection, SDG 11 takes an ominously technocratic and expansive approach that threatens individual freedom and democratic values in the name of environmental sustainability. 

At its core, SDG 11 embraces the elitist, anti-human ideology of sustainable development that views cities primarily through the blinkered lens of their environmental impact. Its targets for reducing cities' environmental footprint call for "sustainable urbanization" through "integrated policies" on issues like housing, transport, disaster risk reduction, air quality, waste management, and public spaces. This top-down, command-and-control vision transforms cities into tightly managed spaces micromanaged by unelected experts and regulators obsessed with curbing humanity's interaction with the natural world.

The SDG's call for "participatory, integrated and sustainable human settlement planning and management" may sound benign, but in practice it legitimizes an updated version of the utopian urban planning tradition of figures like Le Corbusier. Just as that earlier breed of urban visionaries sought to design ideal "rational" cities from scratch, the new sustainable urbanists view existing cities as messy, disorderly spaces in need of radical, expert-led interventions to be made green, clean and sustainable at all costs.

This is clear in SDG 11's insistence on making cities more "resilient" to disasters through "holistic disaster risk management." While precautions against natural disasters are warranted, this rhetoric provides justification for placing more areas of urban life under the control of risk management professionals, emergency planners and other unelected technocrats. We have already seen how the rhetoric of resilience has been used to centralize power during Covid, with the imposition of authoritarian lockdown measures in many cities.  

SDG 11 also explicitly calls for expanding public transport and restricting private vehicle use to reduce emissions, improve air quality and make cities more "sustainable." This war on private vehicle use threatens the hard-won freedom and mobility enjoyed by millions while creating more dependency on substandard, underfunded public transit systems micromanaged by bureaucrats rather than responding to users' actual needs. It reflects a disdain for individual choice and a lack of faith in people's ability to make smart environmental decisions for themselves.

The SDG's emphasis on urban green spaces and "safeguarding the world's cultural and natural heritage" also raises concerns over expropriating public land and property in the name of environmental preservation. In many cities, we have already seen how greening initiatives and conservation efforts have disproportionately harmed the poor and working classes by pricing them out of housing markets near newly gentrified green spaces. SDG 11's implicit endorsement of these strategies threatens to exacerbate such iniquities.

Perhaps most troubling is SDG 11's call for "access to safe, inclusive and accessible green public spaces, particularly for women and children, older persons and persons with disabilities." While public spaces should be safe for all, specifying that green spaces must be designed with certain demographic groups in mind over others opens the door to the disturbing possibility of segregated, identity-group specific urban planning. Do we want the architects and designers (unelected, of course) who plan our cities to parse public space through the toxic prism of group identities?

Underlying all these concerning elements is SDG 11's astounding lack of faith in humanity's ability to build functional, sustainable cities through free cooperation and voluntary exchange. Its proponents treat urbanization as something that must be tightly controlled by experts rather than a spontaneous, organic process of free people pursuing their enlightened self-interest. In truth, market-driven urbanization incentivizes cities to adopt efficient, sustainable practices to attract investment and skilled residents. The cleanest, most dynamic cities tend to be those that embrace economic freedom and voluntary action.

Sustainable Development Goal 11 reflects an unsettling zeal to reshape and control cities through coercive policies justified through the banner of environmental sustainability. It channels the paternalistic spirit of the elitist urban planning tradition, augmented with frightening modern elements of identity politics and resilience authoritarianism. In the name of taming the perceived chaos and disorder of organic urbanization, SDG 11 imperils the rights, liberty and voluntary cooperation that are the true sources of human flourishing and environmental progress. We should firmly reject its agenda.
