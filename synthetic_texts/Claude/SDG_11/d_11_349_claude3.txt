Sustainable cities and communities – the cornerstone of SDG 11 – have emerged as a critical imperative in the global development agenda. As the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, our commitment to this goal is unwavering, driven by a deep understanding of the intricacies and nuances that shape urban landscapes worldwide.

At the heart of our approach lies the recognition that cities are not mere physical constructs but dynamic ecosystems, intrinsically linked to the well-being of their inhabitants and the health of the planet. We acknowledge the intricate interplay between urbanization, economic growth, social inclusion, and environmental sustainability, and strive to address these interconnected challenges holistically.

Our efforts are guided by a comprehensive framework that encompasses urban planning, infrastructure development, housing, and public services. We collaborate closely with local authorities, civil society organizations, and private sector partners to co-create solutions tailored to the unique contexts of each city.

One of our key priorities is ensuring access to adequate, safe, and affordable housing for all. We recognize that housing is not just a physical structure but a fundamental human right, interwoven with dignity, security, and social cohesion. Our interventions range from supporting inclusive housing policies and financing mechanisms to promoting innovative construction techniques and sustainable building materials.

Alongside housing, we place equal emphasis on the provision of reliable and efficient public transportation systems. Sustainable mobility is not only a catalyst for economic development but also a means to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and enhance accessibility for marginalized communities. Our initiatives encompass investments in public transit infrastructure, promotion of non-motorized transport modes, and the integration of smart mobility solutions.

Underpinning our efforts is a strong commitment to urban resilience and disaster risk reduction. As the world grapples with the escalating impacts of climate change and natural disasters, we work tirelessly to strengthen the adaptive capacity of cities. This involves supporting risk assessment and early warning systems, promoting climate-resilient infrastructure, and fostering community-based disaster preparedness and response.

Central to our strategy is the recognition that sustainable urbanization cannot be achieved without addressing the persistent challenges of inequality, social exclusion, and marginalization. We prioritize the empowerment of vulnerable groups, such as women, youth, persons with disabilities, and informal settlement dwellers, ensuring their voices are heard and their needs are met in urban development processes.

Furthermore, we place a strong emphasis on the preservation and promotion of cultural heritage and urban identity. Cities are not merely physical spaces but repositories of rich cultural traditions, histories, and diverse narratives. Our initiatives aim to strike a delicate balance between modernity and heritage, fostering a sense of pride and belonging among urban dwellers.

To catalyze transformative change, we leverage the power of innovation and technology. We support the development of smart city solutions, leveraging digital technologies and data-driven approaches to enhance urban governance, service delivery, and citizen engagement. At the same time, we remain cognizant of the potential risks and challenges associated with technological advancement, striving to ensure that innovation is inclusive, ethical, and aligned with local contexts.

Underpinning our efforts is a robust monitoring and evaluation framework, grounded in evidence-based decision-making and continuous learning. We employ a range of tools and methodologies to track progress, measure impact, and identify areas for improvement, ensuring that our interventions are adaptive and responsive to evolving needs and realities.

Ultimately, our vision for sustainable cities and communities extends beyond the physical infrastructure and encompasses a holistic approach to human well-being, economic prosperity, and environmental stewardship. We recognize that the path towards urban sustainability is a complex and multifaceted journey, requiring collaboration, innovation, and a relentless commitment to leaving no one behind.
