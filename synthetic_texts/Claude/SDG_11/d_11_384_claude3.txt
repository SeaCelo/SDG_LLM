As the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, I am compelled to shed light on the critical nexus between Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11) – Sustainable Cities and Communities – and the multifaceted challenges faced by displaced populations worldwide. The pursuit of inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable urban environments is inextricably linked to the well-being and dignity of refugees, internally displaced persons (IDPs), and stateless individuals.

Urbanization is a defining phenomenon of our era, with an estimated 68% of the world's population projected to reside in cities by 2050. Concurrently, the global refugee population has reached staggering levels, with over 89.3 million individuals forcibly displaced as of 2022. This convergence of trends presents both opportunities and obstacles in realizing SDG 11's aspirations.

Forced displacement often converges in urban spaces, where refugees and IDPs seek safety, economic opportunities, and access to essential services. However, the influx of displaced populations frequently exacerbates existing pressures on housing, infrastructure, and public services, straining the capacities of host communities. In cities like Amman, Jordan, and Kampala, Uganda, the rapid influx of Syrian and South Sudanese refugees, respectively, has strained resources, heightened competition for scarce job opportunities, and exacerbated social tensions.

Ensuring access to adequate, safe, and affordable housing is a paramount challenge. Refugee settlements and informal urban settlements frequently lack basic amenities, such as clean water, sanitation, and electricity, exposing residents to health hazards and compounding their vulnerabilities. The lack of secure tenure and the threat of forced evictions further undermine refugees' sense of safety and stability, impeding their integration and self-reliance.

Moreover, the environmental impact of forced displacement cannot be overlooked. The establishment of refugee camps and the strain on urban resources can contribute to deforestation, soil degradation, and pollution, undermining efforts to create sustainable and resilient communities. In Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, the influx of Rohingya refugees from Myanmar has led to widespread deforestation and environmental degradation, exacerbating the risks of natural disasters and climate change impacts.

Addressing these challenges requires a holistic and collaborative approach, integrating humanitarian and development interventions. Promoting inclusive urban planning and participatory decision-making processes that involve displaced populations is crucial to fostering social cohesion and sustainable urban development. Initiatives like the Global Compact on Refugees and the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CRRF) provide frameworks for burden-sharing and fostering sustainable solutions, including facilitating refugees' access to housing, employment, and public services.

Innovative solutions and partnerships are also essential. For instance, the Kalobeyei Settlement in Kenya has embraced an integrated approach, combining traditional refugee camps with urban planning principles, fostering economic opportunities, and promoting self-reliance among refugees and host communities. Similarly, the Urbanization and Municipal Development Project in Lebanon aims to enhance service delivery and infrastructure in areas hosting Syrian refugees, benefiting both displaced and host populations.

Ultimately, the realization of SDG 11 hinges on our collective commitment to addressing the complex challenges faced by refugees and displaced populations. By fostering inclusive, resilient, and sustainable urban environments, we can uphold the fundamental rights and dignity of those forced to flee their homes, while contributing to the broader goal of creating thriving and prosperous communities for all.
