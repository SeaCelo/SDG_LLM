Here is a detailed and comprehensive response in the form of a long academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 11 from the perspective of renowned Canadian commentator Rex Murphy:

Make Sustainable Cities a Reality, Not Just an Ideal on Parchment

Ah, the Sustainable Development Goals - that Utopian laundry list the United Nations crafted amid self-congratulation and idealistic fervor. A sweeping catalog of aspiration the world's urbane set adores applauding, if not substantively addressing. When it comes to Goal 11 - making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable - this former Newfoundlander must call an unsettling reality check.  

Behind the bureaucratic vernacular lies an undertaking soberingly gargantuan. The human parade has been rudely ushering itself into cities much faster than civic planners can rationally prepare. As I record these words over 55% of the global population resides in urban areas, with that fraction forecasted to balloon to a staggering 68% by 2050. That's an extra 2.5 billion urban dwellers needing sustainable services like sturdy housing, sanitation, transportation, and green spaces. All while ruthlessly curbing pollution, degradation, and the profligate consumption of finite natural resources.

The developing world illustrates the daunting proportions. Calcutta and Mumbai remain mired in blight and squalor generations after the British flitted away. Dhaka teems with informal settlements - entire communities unconnected to civic electricity or water systems and bereft of social services. Even China, for all its grandiose infrastructure blitzes, is buckling under the crush of urban migration and gaping riches/poverty divides. 

Shall I spare words elaborating the challenges beleaguering the teeming, dysfunctional warrens euphemistically branded "slums?" Where every available inch is enveloped in makeshift shelters lacking basic utilities? Streets flooded with raw sewage and trash, air choked with particulates, disease inevitably rampant. This is the grim reality Goal 11 aims to eradicate - and make no mistake, its magnitude is civilizational.

The West is hardly spared its urban sustainability woes. Years of under-investment and mismanagement have left U.S. transit systems like MARTA, SEPTA, and D.C. Metro in advanced decrepitude. Once-mighty metropolises turned hollowed-out shells. Flint's tainted water supply demonstrated America's third-world amenities in forgotten, impoverished quarters. And while Canadian urbanites congratulate themselves for Vancouverism, Toronto's intensification, and Montreal's new urbanism,  skyrocketing housing costs and crumbling infrastructure betray their cities' livability conceits.

Climate change, furthermore, will viscerally undermine urban durability and prosperity - a cruel paradox, as cities concentrate both the causes and solutions for environmental resilience. Catastrophic coastal inundation, intensifying weather extremes, escalating resource scarcities; these incipient menaces threaten to sabotage sustainable development worldwide. Perhaps most unnerving is the "tragedy of the urban commons" - the collective action crises arising as population densities soar exponentially while municipal governments dither.     

So farcical are these impediments that one cannot fault cynicism. The notion of achieving inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable human settlements by 2030 feels Sisyphean against such ubiquitous obstacles. The financing gaps yawn cavernous, public planning flails haplessly behind the demographic curves, the scale of need outstrips resources and political willpower. Without gritty realism replacing lofty rhetoric, Goal 11 is doomed to wistful irrelevance.  

Yet even this grizzled social commentator feels audacious rejecting the ideals. For all my skepticism toward grandiose global targets, I've glimpsed the urban renaissance fortifying local communities. Smart city innovations leveraging digitization, the circular economy, public-private partnerships. Citizen empowerment shattering bureaucratic inertia. Grassroots perseverance breathing vivacity into blighted spaces. 

When civic leaders eschew faddish tokenism and actually consult inhabitants, sustainable solutions materialize organically. Slum neighborhoods revitalized by affordable housing policies respecting livelihoods and cultural heritage. Public realms animated through equitable access to green spaces, pedestrianized boulevards, inclusive recreational facilities. Seamless, sustainable mobility systems incentivizing multi-modal commutes over car dependencies. Human-centric urban design invigorating municipal identity, social capital, and environmental custodianship.

Such tangible illustrations prove Goal 11's premise realizable - if we summon the moral clarity and civic resolve. Local champions, imbued with grit and humanity, can seed virtuous cycles enmeshing economic opportunity, social inclusion, and ecological integrity. When these grassroots visions are nurtured and scaled by enlightened policymakers and financiers, the utopian aspiration materializes into lived reality.

So yes, I lambast the UN's grandiloquent SDGs as too-often degenerating into fatuous box-ticking. Sustainable urban development will never be some triumphal finish line, but an unending, gnarled process of progress catalyzed by perspicacious pragmatism. It demands relentless experimentation, customized innovation accounting for every local idiosyncrasy, and a bottomless reserve of civic grit. Blind idealism buys us merely fleeting photo-ops, while only grounded tenacity forges durable human settlements we might blissfully inhabit for generations.

Goal 11 isn't a whimsical postulation, but an existential imperative as our urban world goes hurtling toward ecological disaster and civic alienation. To foster inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities is arguably the greatest duty our age demands. We will build this equitable, vibrant urban tomorrowland over the doubters' rebuttals - though the trail will be arduous and circuitous, its obstacles Herculean. But what arduous quest wasn't worth perspicaciously pursuing?
