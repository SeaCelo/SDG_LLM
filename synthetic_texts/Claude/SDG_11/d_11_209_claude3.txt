Sustainable Cities and the Deep Roots of Urban Inequality

By Daron Acemoglu

The quest for sustainable and resilient cities, as encapsulated in the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 11, is inextricably linked to the persistence of spatial and regional inequalities both within and across urban areas. These inequalities are not mere transitory phenomena, but rather reflect the deep historical roots and entrenched institutional frameworks that have shaped the urban landscape over generations. To make meaningful progress toward SDG 11, we must confront these path dependencies head-on and recognize cities as complex systems whose trajectory is heavily influenced by their economic histories and prior institutional choices.

At the core of my analysis is the recognition that urban development does not occur on a level playing field. Cities emerge and thrive based on their differential geographic endowments, their timing of emergence relative to industrial and technological waves, and most crucially, the economic institutions and urban policies that either empower or constrain their potential for innovation, productivity growth, and inclusive prosperity. The great divergence we observe in the fortunes of cities across the world directly reflects these critical institutional differences.

Consider the contrasting trajectories of urban giants like New York, London, and Tokyo versus many cities across the developing world grappling with rapid informal urbanization. The former emerged as preeminent commercial and industrial centers when their national economies were institutionalizing an institutional matrix – encompassing secure property rights, entry barriers for new business formation, flexible labor markets – conducive to entrepreneurial investment and the agglomeration of skilled labor. This very same matrix catalyzed self-reinforcing processes of capital accumulation, human capital formation, and technological change that solidified these cities' economic pre-eminence. 

In stark contrast, many cities across Africa, Asia and Latin America were burdened from the outset by institutional constructs ill-suited for private investment and urbanization increasing living standards. Urban policies encouraging excessive regulations and entry barriers stifled the growth of manufacturing and entrepreneurship. Dysfunctional housing policies created sprawling slums lacking basic public services. And the pervasive influence of extractive political and economic elites monopolized urban spaces, preventing the emergence of an inclusive middle class with secure property rights and bargaining power over city development.

These divergent historical trajectories cast long shadows over the present-day challenges toward realizing SDG 11. Institutionally advantaged cities must still grapple with rising inequality, energy inefficiency, infrastructural strains, and environmental degradation fueled by their very economic success. But the challenges facing institutionally disadvantaged cities are even more daunting – lack of affordable housing, proliferation of slum dwellings, inadequate public transportation, poor sanitation and waste management systems, and heightened vulnerability to disasters and climate change.  

Furthermore, these urban inequities often reflect and reinforce pre-existing spatial inequalities across rural-urban divides and between cities advantaged or disadvantaged by geography, climate, and historical contingencies. A sustainable development agenda for cities must be cognizant that in many nations, resources and investment disproportionately concentrate in a few prosperous urban centers, while poorer cities and rural hinterlands fall into cyclical traps of underdevelopment.

Unlocking greater sustainability for all cities necessitates dismantling these entrenched inequalities at their root, rather than relying on urban policies and short-term interventions operating on the periphery. We need bold institutional reforms equalizing access to housing, infrastructure, and economic opportunity within urban areas. But equally crucial are reforms upgrading national institutional underpinnings – bolstering property rights, reducing entry barriers, and empowering urban residents to hold municipal authorities accountable. 

Only by tackling the deep historical origins of urban disparities can we clear the path for cities worldwide to become truly "inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable" as envisioned by SDG 11. Sustainable urbanization is fundamentally intertwined with equitable and innovation-driven economic development writ large. Realizing the goal of sustainable cities requires mobilizing cities as hubs of human creativity, entrepreneurial dynamism, and upward social mobility. This will remain an elusive quest without confronting the institutional sources of urban inequality once and for all.
