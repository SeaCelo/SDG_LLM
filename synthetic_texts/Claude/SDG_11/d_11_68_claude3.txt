Making Cities Work for All: A Clarion Call for Just, Inclusive and Resilient Urbanization

By Michele Landsberg

The relentless march of urbanization is one of the defining megatrends reshaping our world. More than half the global population now resides in cities, and that proportion is projected to swell to nearly 70% by mid-century. Concentrated centers of human activity, cities are paradoxically both hubs of economic growth and innovation, yet also crucibles of inequity, environmental degradation, and social malaise. How we plan, develop, and govern these urban areas will be pivotal in determining whether we catalyze transformative sustainable development or catalyze deepening crises on multiple fronts.  

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have rightly placed a spotlight on the centrality of sustainable urbanization through SDG 11 - making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. This ambitious agenda reflects a stark reality: cities, while engines of progress, are also vectors of social injustice, economic exclusion, and environmental harm. The lofty goals of eradicating poverty, protecting the planet, and fostering shared prosperity all hinge on how we address this quintessential challenge of our rapidly urbanizing world.

Too many cities globally remain scarred by spatial and economic segregation, inadequate and unaffordable housing, crumbling infrastructure deficits, unchecked urban sprawl, vulnerability to climate impacts, and lack of inclusive participation. Favelas in Rio, slum districts in Mumbai, decaying public housing projects in Chicago - these are just visceral symptoms of the urban divide separating the haves from the have-nots. Behind the glittering skyscrapers and chic neighborhoods lies a reality of marginalization, alienation, and lack of access to core rights and services.  

There is nothing natural or inevitable about this bifurcation. Rather, it is the product of political economy forces, governance failures, and ingrained biases borne of structural inequities linked to income, gender, race, ethnicity, disability, and age. For too long, urban planning has been dominated by profit motives, land speculation, and development interests over the public good. City decision-making processes frequently shut out the voices of the urban poor, minority groups, and other vulnerable populations. Exclusionary zoning, lack of affordable housing, and privatization of public spaces reflect the imbalanced power dynamics at play.

But we have the knowledge, resources and moral conviction to reimagine urbanization as a Great Equalizer rather than perpetuating it as a Machine of Division. SDG 11 provides a holistic framework and catalyst for pioneering inclusive, equitable cities that work for all people and harmonize with environmental imperatives.

At its core, it demands accessible, sustainable housing and basic services as a human right, not a privilege. It calls for comprehensive affordable and sustainable transport systems, compact and integrated settlements, inclusive public spaces, safeguards for cultural and natural heritage, disaster resilience, and participatory planning and management engaging all segments of society.

When realized, SDG 11 unlocks a virtuous cycle of positive urban transformation. Appropriate zoning and densification mitigates urban sprawl over farmlands and ecosystems. Green buildings and green spaces enhance sustainability and climate resilience. Affordable housing and integrated neighborhoods counter segregation and isolation. Reliable public transit lessens air pollution, congestion, and carbon emissions. Involving all stakeholders, especially marginalized groups, fosters cohesion and shared ownership over the city's future trajectory.  

Critically, SDG 11 cannot be viewed in isolation but must cohere with the entire 2030 Agenda. Realizing sustainable cities hinges on progress across the interconnected social, economic and environmental dimensions - eradicating poverty and hunger, securing decent jobs, achieving gender equality, ensuring clean energy access, addressing climate vulnerabilities, and more.

This daunting, multi-faceted challenge will require unprecedented cooperation across all societal actors - municipal and national governments, private sector, civil society, grassroots movements, and engaged urban citizenry. Innovative public-private partnerships, participatory planning and budgeting, and cross-jurisdictional coordination are vital. Financing gaps for urban sustainable infrastructure must be bridged through traditional and catalytic sources like municipal bonds, development banks, public-private partnerships, and resource pooling at metropolitan scales.

Critics may dismiss SDG 11 as an utopian flight of fancy, while real estate and development lobbies may perceive it as a threat to profit-driven business models. Change of any kind, let alone transformation on this scale, provokes resistance. But we have before us an ethical and practical imperative - to hit the reset button on our urbanization trajectory before it is too late. Inaction courts dystopian risks of climate chaos, resource depletion, social unrest, and economic stagnation that will make our cities unlivable for all but the privileged few.

The path we take is up to us. As Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres declared, "The future will be won or lost in our cities." With social capitalism running rampant worldwide, sustainable urbanization might be our last best hope to salvage human dignity, equitable prosperity, and ecological balance. The failure of stewardship to SDG 11 is a moral lapse with catastrophic consequences we cannot risk.

This is our clarion call for a new era of inclusive cities premised on just, sustainable, and resilient development that leaves no person and no community behind. We have a fleeting but critical window to translate SDG 11 from aspiration into implementation. The roadmap is clear, the need undeniable; what remains is mustering and focusing the civic resolve and multilateral action to make this urban vision reality for all.
