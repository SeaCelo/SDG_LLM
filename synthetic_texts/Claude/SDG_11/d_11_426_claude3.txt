The Lamia Afghan Foundation's report on Sustainable Development Goal 11 – Sustainable Cities and Communities – paints a sobering picture of the challenges faced by urban areas globally, while also highlighting pockets of progress and innovative solutions being implemented across diverse contexts.

Afghanistan's urban landscape stands as a microcosm of the broader issues plaguing cities worldwide. The rapid influx of internally displaced persons and returning refugees, coupled with a lack of sustainable urban planning and inadequate housing policies, has led to the proliferation of informal settlements on the outskirts of major cities like Kabul, Herat, and Mazar-i-Sharif. These densely packed, underserviced communities lack access to basic amenities such as clean water, sanitation, and reliable energy sources, exacerbating public health concerns and perpetuating cycles of poverty.

The Foundation's field research in Kabul's informal settlements reveals a dire situation, with families residing in makeshift dwellings constructed from scavenged materials, often in precarious locations prone to natural disasters like flooding and landslides. The lack of secure tenure and the constant threat of eviction further compound the vulnerabilities faced by these marginalized communities.

However, the report also highlights glimmers of hope, drawing attention to grassroots initiatives that are tackling these challenges head-on. In the Khair Khana district of Kabul, a women-led cooperative has emerged, leveraging traditional Afghan craftsmanship to create eco-friendly construction materials from recycled waste. These innovative building materials not only provide a sustainable alternative to conventional construction methods but also generate income opportunities for the local community.

The report also underscores the importance of inclusive urban planning and participatory decision-making processes. In the city of Herat, a collaborative effort between local authorities, civil society organizations, and community representatives has led to the development of a comprehensive urban renewal strategy. This initiative focuses on revitalizing historical neighborhoods, preserving cultural heritage sites, and fostering sustainable tourism – a potential economic driver for the region.

Globally, the report draws parallels with cities like Medellin, Colombia, where innovative urban planning and investment in public transportation, green spaces, and community infrastructure have transformed once-marginalized neighborhoods into thriving, inclusive communities. The report highlights the potential for such approaches to be adapted and scaled in Afghan cities, fostering social cohesion and environmental sustainability.

The report also delves into the critical role of data and technology in fostering sustainable urbanization. It showcases examples from cities like Amsterdam and Singapore, where smart city initiatives and the integration of digital technologies have optimized resource management, improved public services, and enhanced disaster preparedness.

Ultimately, the Lamia Afghan Foundation's report serves as a clarion call for concerted action and a paradigm shift in how we approach urban development. It emphasizes the need for a holistic, multi-stakeholder approach that prioritizes the needs of the most vulnerable while also promoting environmental sustainability, economic opportunities, and cultural preservation. By drawing upon global best practices and adapting them to local contexts, the report envisions a future where Afghan cities can become beacons of resilience, inclusivity, and sustainable development.
