The struggle to make cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable is at the heart of Sustainable Development Goal 11. As an economist and development practitioner, I have witnessed firsthand the transformative power of thoughtful urban planning and the devastating consequences of neglecting our built environments.

Cities are engines of growth, hubs of innovation, and melting pots of culture. Yet, the world's urban areas are also breeding grounds for inequality, pollution, and social unrest. The way we design, build, and manage our cities will shape the trajectory of human development for generations to come.

Through my work with the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL), I have seen how evidence-based policymaking can catalyze positive change in urban settings. Take, for instance, our efforts to improve public transportation in Accra, Ghana. By conducting randomized evaluations of different fare structures and route optimizations, we were able to identify interventions that increased ridership, reduced commute times, and lowered emissions – all while making the system more financially sustainable.

This approach, grounded in rigorous data collection and analysis, is essential for tackling the multifaceted challenges posed by rapid urbanization. Too often, well-intentioned policies fail to deliver their intended benefits due to unforeseen consequences or a lack of contextual understanding. By embracing an experimental mindset and iterating based on empirical evidence, we can design interventions that are tailored to local realities and responsive to evolving needs.

Take, for example, the issue of informal settlements – a pervasive challenge in many developing cities. Conventional wisdom might suggest that slum clearance and resettlement is the best solution, but our research has shown that such top-down approaches can be counterproductive, disrupting social networks and economic opportunities that are crucial for the livelihoods of the urban poor.

Instead, we have found that incremental upgrading strategies, which involve investing in basic infrastructure and services within existing settlements, can yield far better outcomes. By working closely with community members and leveraging their deep knowledge of local conditions, we can craft interventions that improve living standards while minimizing the disruption of established social and economic systems.

Of course, addressing the SDG 11 targets is not solely about physical infrastructure and housing. We must also grapple with the social dimensions of urban development, such as access to public spaces, exposure to crime and violence, and the preservation of cultural heritage.

Here, too, a data-driven approach can yield insights that challenge conventional wisdom. For instance, our work on urban crime prevention has shown that initiatives like neighborhood watch programs and street lighting can be effective in reducing violence, but only when implemented in concert with broader community engagement strategies that build trust and social cohesion.

Ultimately, achieving the vision of sustainable cities and communities will require a holistic, multidisciplinary approach that draws upon the best available evidence and leverages the knowledge of diverse stakeholders. It is a daunting challenge, but one that we must embrace with urgency and creativity.

As we grapple with the complexities of urbanization, we must remain steadfast in our commitment to rigorous research and data-driven policymaking. Only by constantly questioning our assumptions, testing our interventions, and adapting to new insights can we hope to build cities that are truly inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable.
