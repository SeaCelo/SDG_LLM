Addressing the complexities of Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11) – "Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable" – requires a multifaceted approach that acknowledges the intricate web of challenges and opportunities interwoven within the global urban landscape. As a leading humanitarian organization, Mercy Corps has been at the forefront of promoting sustainable and inclusive urban development, drawing upon decades of on-the-ground experience and a deep understanding of the intricate socio-economic dynamics that shape cities worldwide.

The rapid pace of urbanization, particularly in the Global South, has exacerbated the strain on already-fragile urban systems, leading to a proliferation of informal settlements, inadequate housing, and insufficient access to basic services. Mercy Corps' interventions have focused on empowering marginalized communities through integrated approaches that address the multidimensional aspects of urban poverty, from improving access to safe and affordable housing to fostering inclusive economic opportunities and enhancing disaster preparedness.

One of the organization's flagship initiatives is the "Resilient Cities" program, implemented in partnership with local governments, community-based organizations, and the private sector. This program adopts a holistic approach to urban resilience, recognizing that the challenges facing cities are inextricably linked to broader issues of poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation.

Through this program, Mercy Corps has pioneered innovative solutions tailored to specific urban contexts. In rapidly growing cities like Nairobi, Kenya, and Port-au-Prince, Haiti, the organization has worked to upgrade informal settlements, providing essential infrastructure such as access to clean water, sanitation facilities, and secure tenure. Simultaneously, it has facilitated skill-building and entrepreneurship opportunities for residents, enabling them to break the cycle of poverty and actively participate in the economic life of the city.

Recognizing the disproportionate impact of urban crises on marginalized groups, Mercy Corps has also focused on promoting inclusive and participatory urban governance. In cities like Erbil, Iraq, and Beirut, Lebanon, where rapid influxes of displaced populations have strained resources and exacerbated tensions, the organization has facilitated dialogue between host communities and displaced populations, fostering social cohesion and promoting the co-creation of sustainable solutions.

Moreover, Mercy Corps has been at the forefront of integrating climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction into its urban programming. In cities like Sittwe, Myanmar, and Monrovia, Liberia, where coastal communities are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, the organization has implemented nature-based solutions, such as mangrove restoration and community-based early warning systems, to enhance resilience and protect livelihoods.

Central to Mercy Corps' approach is the recognition that sustainable urban development cannot be achieved through top-down solutions alone. Instead, the organization has prioritized community-driven initiatives that leverage local knowledge, resources, and capacities. By fostering inclusive governance structures and empowering community-based organizations, Mercy Corps has enabled local stakeholders to be active agents in shaping the future of their cities.

Furthermore, Mercy Corps has been a strong advocate for data-driven decision-making and evidence-based programming in the urban context. The organization has developed robust monitoring and evaluation frameworks, leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as remote sensing and geospatial analysis to track progress and inform adaptive programming.

While significant progress has been made, the challenges facing urban areas remain daunting. As cities continue to grow and grapple with the compounding effects of climate change, conflict, and economic volatility, the need for innovative and holistic solutions becomes even more pressing. Mercy Corps remains committed to advancing SDG 11, collaborating with partners across sectors and disciplines to co-create sustainable, inclusive, and resilient cities that offer dignity and opportunity for all.
