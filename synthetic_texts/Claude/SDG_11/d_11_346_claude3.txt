The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) represent a global call to action to eradicate poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all. Goal 11, "Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable," is at the heart of this ambitious global agenda.

At the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID), we recognize that cities are true engines of economic growth, social progress, and innovation. However, they also face unprecedented challenges, such as rapid population growth, resource scarcity, environmental degradation, and growing inequality. Making our cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable is therefore essential to the success of the 2030 Agenda.

In this context, AECID has intensified its efforts to support partner countries in implementing SDG 11. Our approach is based on three fundamental pillars: inclusive urban planning, affordable and accessible housing, and sustainable mobility.

Inclusive urban planning is essential to ensure that our cities are livable spaces for all, regardless of age, gender, disability, or socioeconomic status. We work closely with local authorities and communities to develop participatory urban plans that promote social integration, universal accessibility, and the preservation of cultural heritage.

Regarding affordable and accessible housing, we strive to provide innovative solutions to address the housing deficit and improve the living conditions of the most vulnerable populations. We support projects for the construction of social housing, programs for upgrading informal settlements, and sustainable urban renewal initiatives.

Finally, sustainable mobility is key to achieving cleaner, more efficient, and climate-resilient cities. We promote the implementation of high-quality public transport systems, infrastructure for pedestrians and cyclists, and smart mobility solutions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality.

Our interventions are grounded in a comprehensive approach that recognizes the interconnections between the SDGs and promotes long-term sustainable solutions. We work closely with governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector to maximize the impact of our actions.

Ultimately, the success of SDG 11 depends on our collective ability to rethink and transform our cities. At AECID, we are committed to continuing to lead these efforts and contributing to the creation of more inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities for present and future generations.
