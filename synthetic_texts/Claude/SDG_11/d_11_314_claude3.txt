Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11), focused on "Making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable," is a cornerstone for socioeconomic and environmental progress. In the Chilean context, this goal holds critical importance due to rapid urbanization, environmental challenges, and persistent inequality in urban areas.

Despite significant progress in reducing poverty and improving the quality of life, Chilean cities still face major challenges in sustainability and inclusion. The lack of integrated urban planning, a shortage of affordable housing, environmental pollution, and socio-spatial segregation are among the main issues threatening the achievement of SDG 11.

One of the greatest challenges lies in addressing inequality in access to basic services and economic opportunities. While Chile has experienced sustained economic growth in recent decades, this progress has not been equitably distributed across urban areas. Marginalized neighborhoods and informal settlements, such as "poblaciones" in Santiago, lack adequate infrastructure, access to public services, and job opportunities, perpetuating cycles of poverty and social exclusion.

Another key challenge is enhancing the resilience of cities to the impacts of climate change and natural disasters. As a highly seismic country with significant climatic diversity, Chile must prioritize building resilient infrastructure and implementing climate change mitigation and adaptation measures. Recent droughts in cities like Santiago and Valpara√≠so underscore the urgency of addressing sustainable water resource management and protecting urban ecosystems.

Additionally, sustainable urban mobility is a crucial factor in achieving more inclusive and resilient cities. While Chile has made progress in developing public transport systems, such as Transantiago in the capital, challenges remain regarding accessibility, efficiency, and modal integration. Reducing air pollution caused by vehicular traffic and promoting non-polluting transportation modes, such as cycling and walking, are key priorities.

To tackle these challenges, adopting a multidimensional and intersectoral approach is essential, involving all key stakeholders, including the government, private sector, civil society, and local communities. The Chilean Agency for International Cooperation, in collaboration with international organizations and NGOs, can play a pivotal role in promoting innovative initiatives and best practices for sustainable urban development.

Priority actions could include strengthening regulatory frameworks and urban planning, investing in green and resilient infrastructure, promoting affordable housing, and implementing community empowerment and training programs. Furthermore, fostering citizen participation and collaborative governance is crucial to ensuring that the voices of marginalized and vulnerable groups are heard and incorporated into decision-making processes.

In summary, achieving SDG 11 in Chile requires a holistic and transformative approach that addresses the multidimensional challenges of cities, promoting social inclusion, environmental resilience, and economic sustainability. Only through intersectoral collaboration and coordinated action at national and local levels can Chile advance toward a more just, resilient, and sustainable urban future for all.
