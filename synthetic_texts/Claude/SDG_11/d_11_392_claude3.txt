Sustainable cities and communities, the eleventh Sustainable Development Goal, lie at the heart of ActionAid's mission to address the multifaceted challenges of rapid urbanization, rising inequalities, and environmental degradation. Our analysis paints a sobering picture of the current state of affairs, but also highlights promising pathways for transformative change.

The relentless influx of people into urban areas, particularly in the Global South, has outpaced the capacity of local authorities to provide adequate housing, infrastructure, and basic services. The result is a proliferation of informal settlements, characterized by overcrowding, substandard living conditions, and lack of access to clean water, sanitation, and affordable energy sources. This urban poverty trap perpetuates cycles of deprivation, exacerbating health risks and limiting economic opportunities for millions of residents.

Compounding these challenges is the growing threat of climate change, which disproportionately impacts the most vulnerable populations living in precarious urban environments. Rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and environmental degradation pose existential risks to coastal cities and low-lying settlements, while also straining already overburdened infrastructure and exacerbating resource scarcity.

ActionAid's on-the-ground assessments reveal a troubling trend of forced evictions and displacement, often driven by unchecked urban development and gentrification. These practices not only violate fundamental human rights but also disrupt communities, erode social cohesion, and perpetuate cycles of poverty and marginalization.

However, our analysis also highlights innovative solutions and best practices that offer hope for a more sustainable and equitable urban future. Participatory urban planning processes that meaningfully engage diverse stakeholders, including marginalized communities, have proven effective in fostering inclusive decision-making and tailoring interventions to local contexts. Initiatives such as community-led slum upgrading, decentralized renewable energy solutions, and grassroots waste management programs have demonstrated the potential for empowering residents and promoting resilient, self-sustaining communities.

Furthermore, ActionAid's research underscores the critical role of data-driven policymaking and evidence-based advocacy. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies and collaborating with academic institutions, civil society organizations, and local governments, we can better understand the complex dynamics shaping urban environments and design targeted interventions that address the root causes of inequalities and environmental degradation.

Ultimately, our analysis emphasizes the inextricable link between sustainable cities and communities and the broader global agenda for sustainable development. Achieving progress on SDG 11 is not only a moral imperative but also a strategic necessity for realizing other interconnected goals, such as poverty alleviation, gender equality, climate action, and economic growth.

As we forge ahead, ActionAid remains committed to amplifying the voices of the urban poor, advocating for inclusive and participatory governance, and fostering cross-sectoral partnerships that drive transformative change. By embracing innovative approaches, leveraging local knowledge, and mobilizing collective action, we can create cities and communities that are resilient, equitable, and sustainable for generations to come.
