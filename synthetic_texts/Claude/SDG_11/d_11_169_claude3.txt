There's a crisis unfolding in our cities that often flies under the radar – a silent tsunami of urbanization that is threatening to undermine our progress on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As an op-ed columnist for The New York Times, I've witnessed firsthand the stark realities of this challenge in the world's rapidly expanding informal settlements, where makeshift shelters of tarpaulin and scrap metal serve as homes for millions.

SDG 11 – centered on "making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable" – is a rallying cry to confront head-on the mounting pressures of urbanization. By 2050, nearly 70% of the global population will reside in cities, with 90% of this urban growth occurring in developing countries ill-equipped to handle such an influx.

In the slums of Mumbai, I've seen families of six or more cramped into 10x10 foot rooms, with little access to clean water, sanitation, or basic services. Children play amidst open sewers, at risk of waterborne diseases like cholera. Women face the constant threat of gender-based violence in the absence of safe public spaces. Residents live under the perpetual specter of eviction, their homes and livelihoods perpetually at risk.

This is the harsh reality for an estimated 1 billion slum dwellers worldwide – a reality that violates the core principles of SDG 11: ensuring access to affordable housing, upgrading slum settlements, providing access to safe and inclusive green spaces, and safeguarding our cultural and natural heritage.

We cannot achieve the SDGs without prioritizing the needs of our burgeoning urban poor. Slums are not just a blight on our cities – they are incubators for social unrest, economic stagnation, and public health crises that reverberate far beyond their boundaries.

The path forward requires a multi-pronged approach: investing in affordable housing solutions that incorporate green building principles, upgrading informal settlements with basic services and secure land tenure, and championing inclusive urban planning that amplifies the voices of the marginalized.

In Medellin, Colombia, I witnessed a shining example of this holistic approach. The city's pioneering Metrocable system – a series of aerial cable cars – has transformed isolated hillside slums into vibrant, connected communities. By seamlessly integrating public transit, affordable housing, and social services like schools and health clinics, Medellin has uplifted its most vulnerable citizens while reducing its carbon footprint.

We need more cities to embrace such innovative, people-centered solutions – solutions that recognize that sustainable development is inextricably linked to human dignity and equal opportunity.

As we work to achieve SDG 11, we must also confront the reality that urbanization is both a driver and consequence of climate change. Cities consume over two-thirds of the world's energy and account for more than 70% of global carbon emissions. Yet they are also on the frontlines of climate impacts, from rising sea levels to extreme weather events.

Building resilience means future-proofing our cities through investments in green infrastructure, disaster risk reduction, and climate-smart urban planning. It means empowering local governments and communities to lead the charge in adapting to our changing world.

In Rotterdam, for instance, I witnessed innovative flood management strategies like water plazas that double as public spaces during dry periods, and parking garages designed to temporarily store excess rainwater.

Such forward-thinking approaches are vital as we strive to create cities that are truly sustainable – cities that nurture human potential while safeguarding our planet's finite resources.

At its core, SDG 11 is a reminder that cities are more than just concrete jungles – they are the crucibles of human civilization, the engines of economic growth, and the incubators of art, culture, and progress. When we invest in our cities, we invest in our collective future.

But that investment must be equitable, inclusive, and grounded in the principles of human rights and environmental stewardship. We cannot leave anyone behind, whether in the slums of Nairobi or the public housing projects of New York City.

As we chart a course towards a more sustainable urban future, let us be guided by the timeless wisdom of Jane Jacobs, who famously proclaimed: "Cities have the capability of providing something for everybody, only because, and only when, they are created by everybody."

It's a call to action we must heed – to build cities that are truly for all, by all. Only then can we unlock the transformative potential of SDG 11 and create a more just, resilient, and prosperous world for generations to come.
