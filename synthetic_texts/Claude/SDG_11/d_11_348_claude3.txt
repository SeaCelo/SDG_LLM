Cities and communities around the world face extensive challenges in achieving sustainable development. As a leading actor in Swedish international development cooperation, it has become imperative for us to pay special attention to Goal 11 of the 2030 Agenda – to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable.

Urbanization is advancing at a rapid pace, with nearly 60% of the world’s population now living in cities, a figure expected to rise to 68% by 2050. This demographic shift brings both opportunities and challenges for sustainable development. Cities are hubs for economic growth, social interaction, and cultural exchange, but their growing populations place increasing pressure on infrastructure, housing, basic services, and natural resources.

Inefficient urban planning has resulted in alarming numbers of people living in informal settlements and slums where sanitation, access to clean water, and basic services fall far below acceptable levels. Moreover, the high population density increases vulnerability to natural disasters, pandemics, and other crises, highlighting the need for inclusive and resilient cities.

To promote sustainable cities, we must adopt a holistic approach that integrates economic, social, and environmental aspects. This includes investments in efficient and inclusive urban planning, accessible and sustainable transport infrastructure, adequate and affordable housing, and the protection of cultural heritage and green public spaces. Strengthening local governments is also essential to better manage rapid urbanization and its effects.

Another crucial aspect is fostering the benefits of functional urban areas through urban-rural linkages. Cities are deeply interdependent with their surrounding rural areas, and seamless interaction between them is critical. This involves investing in sustainable food and energy systems, integrated waste management, and infrastructure that connects urban and rural areas. In this way, cities can become hubs of sustainable development that benefit both urban and rural populations.

In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the resilience and preparedness of cities for crises have come into sharp focus. We must invest in disaster risk reduction, health preparedness, and community services that ensure cities are resilient to global threats. Digitalization and innovative solutions, such as smart cities, can provide tools for efficient resource management, sharing economies, and broad societal participation.

A key aspect is also integrating a gender equality and equity perspective. Discrimination and marginalization prevent many from fully participating in and benefiting from urban development. Inclusive decision-making, investments in affordable housing, safe public spaces, and equitable mobility are essential for cities that work for everyone.

Finally, financing and inclusive partnerships are critical to achieving sustainable cities. Both domestic and international resources, including from the private sector, must be mobilized. This requires coordination and accountability at all levels – local, national, and global. Only through active participation by all stakeholders can we shape cities that are inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable for both present and future generations.
