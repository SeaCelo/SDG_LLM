Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), written from the perspective of controversial conservative Australian political commentator Piers Akerman:

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals are little more than a thinly-veiled globalist power grab dressed up in environmentalist rhetoric. Of the 17 goals, arguably none is more insidious than SDG 11 which deals with cities and communities under the Orwellian title of making them "inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable."  

Let's start with the notion of an "inclusive" city. What the UN socialists really want is open borders and the free movement of peoples across the world into Western nations. They couch it in harmless-sounding language about providing "access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems" and "universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible green public spaces." But their true agenda is unleashing a flood of migrants from the Third World into our booming metropolises like Sydney and Melbourne.  

The results of this enforced inclusivity and diversity are there for all to see â€“ soaring crime rates, ethnic ghettos, declining social cohesion, and the inexorable transformation of our society into a balkanized tribal patchwork. Just look at the immigrant-heavy suburbs in Western Sydney or the African enclaves of Melbourne to see where this UN plan leads. Law-abiding Australians increasingly find themselves imprisoned in their own homes, afraid to go out after dark.

As for making cities "safe," this is more UN newspeak. What the democracy-undermining bureaucrats really want is to load our burgeoning urban centers with more surveillance cameras, facial recognition technology, and draconian police powers - all under the guise of boosting "public safety" through smart cities and e-governance initiatives. It's the slippery slope to an omnipresent big brother police state.

Then there's the hopelessly vague and ominous goal of enhancing "resilience." The green extremists use this as a catch-all justification for economically disastrous climate policies and environmental regulations. Think carbon taxes, forced rezoning, and restrictions on property rights in the name of emissions reduction, conservation, and "sustainable urban planning." When did Australia sign up to impoverish its productive base with this sort of eco-insanity?  

Underpinning all of this is the Marxist conception of sustainable development itself - the idea that Western societies like Australia must be starved of growth and progress in order to facilitate wealth redistribution to the Third World. Our success is portrayed as the cause of global poverty, rather than a beacon of inspiration. The SDGs are a recipe for civilizational decline wrapped up in a shiny human rights bow.

As long as these noxious goals are being advanced by un-elected UN functionaries and foreign leaders like Socialist comrades Jacinda Ardern and Justin Trudeau, commonsense Australians must stand in full-throated opposition. Our national sovereignty, identity, and way of life is under threat from these borderless globalists who seek to undermine democracy using shrill appeals to equity, diversity, and climate alarmism. 

We must reject SDG 11 and the broader UN agenda it represents. Our major cities should serve the interests of Australians first and remain unapologetic meritocratic hubs of opportunity, economic growth, and Western democratic values. Not globalist experimentation zones for cultural self-flagellation and radical social engineering. If you want a glimpse of the UN's ideal "sustainable city," just look at the dysfunctional, high-crime, ethnic powder kegs that now fester in the grim outer suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne.
