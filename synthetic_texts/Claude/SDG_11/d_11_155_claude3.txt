Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 11 on sustainable cities and communities, written from the perspective of op-ed columnist Maureen Dowd:

Mirror, Mirror on the Mall: America's Urban Identity Crisis

President Biden talks a big game about building back better and greener, but are our cities even poised for the kinds of transformative changes needed to make them sustainable bastions of 21st century life? I have my doubts, given the crumbling state of our nation's urban infrastructure and the ways our metropolises remain plagued by inequality, pollution, and flagrant environmental injustices.

Let's look at the harsh reality: From the buckled sidewalks of Washington D.C. to the traffic-clogged arteries of Los Angeles, our cities are groaning under the weight of past neglect and lack of foresight. Pothole-pocked roads are more common than leafy pedestrian malls. Toxic Superfund sites fester in low-income neighborhoods while the privileged withdraw into their gated eco-enclaves. And is there any American who hasn't sighed in frustration at the maddeningly inadequate public transit options offered by most municipalities?

Even a vibrant city like New York still has boarded-up storefronts and long-neglected housing projects overshadowed by new luxury condo high-rises catering to the ultra-wealthy. Tale of two cities, indeed. We're recreating a modern-day version of the cramped, filthy urban ghettos that plagued Dickensian London in the Victorian era - only now the marginalized are increasingly being pushed out rather than just contained.

Climate change poses yet another existential threat to our urban areas. With rising seas and escalating extreme weather events, the very sustainability of coastal megacities like Miami and New Orleans is being called into question. And with suburbs continuing their ravenous outward sprawl, even inland cities are paving over the greenspaces needed to absorb rainfall and mitigate heat islands.  

You'd think city planners would have taken heed of Jane Jacobs' impassioned cries decades ago to build denser, more pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods designed around human scale and community needs rather than catering to the automobile. But too often the modernist ethos of poor public housing towers or massive urban renewal projects clearcutting diverse neighborhoods still holds sway.

There are glimmers of hope, like New York's inspired High Line park project reclaiming abandoned rail infrastructure as an urban greenway. And cities like Copenhagen, long at the vanguard of walkable, bikeable urbanism, puts most American counterparts to shame in pioneering green city design. But the sad reality is that most of our hubs are still sprawling concrete jungles ill-equipped for the challenges of the 21st century.

We Americans have always had a dysfunctional relationship with cities. The pioneering ideal of loners staking their claims on the frontier persists, with ex-urbanites fleeing to the burbs at the first sign of urban grit. And white flight has perpetuated a vicious cycle of disinvestment in minority communities. Even among the urban bourgeoisie, there's a stubborn resistance to adopting the kinds of progressive density policies and transit-oriented lifestyles that could make our cities truly sustainable and equitable. 

It's telling that among Biden's signature policies, urban planning and design aren't really on the radar. The president is leaning instead on expanding green energy incentives and investments - important for sure, but not a real panacea for the intractable structural issues plaguing our metropolitan areas. Maybe his team should take a field trip to Tokyo, Seoul or Mexico City - places where city living is truly an art embraced by rich and poor alike, where mass transit systems put our own to shame, and where human scale and green space are seamlessly woven into the urban fabric.

Rethinking our haphazard, siloed approach to cities and their role in society is imperative for America to meet the daunting sustainable development goals we've committed to. It's not just about bold new construction projects or high-tech infrastructure. We need to overhaul our entire mindset. Cities are the past and the future - not merely economic engines but cultural and environmental bellwethers. It's time we start treating them as such.
