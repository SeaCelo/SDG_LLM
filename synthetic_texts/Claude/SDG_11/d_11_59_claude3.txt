Building Sustainable Cities and Communities: A Contrarian Perspective by Judith Sloan

The 11th Sustainable Development Goal, aimed at creating sustainable cities and communities, has garnered widespread support from policymakers, urban planners, and environmentalists alike. However, as an economist with a contrarian bent, I find myself questioning the underlying assumptions and feasibility of this ambitious endeavor.

At the outset, it is important to recognize that urbanization is a natural consequence of economic development and industrialization. As countries progress and incomes rise, people inevitably flock to cities in search of better opportunities and a higher standard of living. This phenomenon has been observed across the globe, from the Industrial Revolution in Europe to the rapid urbanization of emerging economies like China and India.

While the proponents of SDG 11 seek to make cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable, their vision often clashes with economic realities and individual preferences. The notion of "affordable housing," for instance, is a laudable goal, but it raises questions about the trade-offs between affordability and market forces. Artificially suppressing housing prices through rent controls or subsidies can distort market signals, leading to shortages, inefficient resource allocation, and a deterioration of housing quality in the long run.

Similarly, the emphasis on public transportation and reduced reliance on private vehicles may align with environmental objectives, but it fails to account for the convenience, flexibility, and personal preferences that drive many individuals to choose private modes of transportation. Attempting to force behavioral changes through draconian policies or excessive taxation could backfire, reducing economic productivity and individual freedom.

Moreover, the pursuit of sustainable cities often overlooks the unintended consequences of well-intentioned policies. Stringent zoning regulations, for instance, can stifle housing supply and drive up prices, exacerbating the very affordability issues they seek to address. Likewise, overly restrictive environmental regulations can hinder economic growth, impeding the very resources needed to invest in sustainable infrastructure and technologies.

It is also worth noting that the concept of sustainability itself is inherently subjective and open to interpretation. What one group deems sustainable may be viewed as unsustainable by others. The trade-offs between environmental concerns, economic growth, and individual liberties are complex and context-dependent, defying a one-size-fits-all solution.

Rather than adhering to a rigid, top-down approach, policymakers should embrace a more nuanced and decentralized approach to urban development. Local communities and stakeholders should be empowered to determine their own priorities and trade-offs, tailoring solutions to their unique circumstances and preferences.

Ultimately, sustainable cities and communities cannot be achieved through coercive policies or utopian visions imposed from above. Instead, we must foster an environment that encourages innovation, entrepreneurship, and market-based solutions. By harnessing the power of individuals, communities, and businesses, we can organically cultivate cities that strike a balance between economic prosperity, environmental stewardship, and individual freedom.
