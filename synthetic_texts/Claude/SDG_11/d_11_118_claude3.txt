Sustainability's Urban Frontier: Examining SDG 11 Through an Anthropological Lens

By Robert Crampton, PhD

As an anthropologist, I find the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11) – "Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable" – to be a fascinating confluence of socio-cultural, economic, and environmental factors. Cities, those dense nuclei of human activity, represent both the greatest challenges and opportunities for achieving sustainable development.

At the heart of SDG 11 lies a fundamental tension: the need to accommodate the inexorable growth of urban populations while minimizing the associated environmental degradation and social inequalities. This tension is particularly acute in the rapidly urbanizing regions of the Global South, where informal settlements and slums proliferate, straining already overburdened infrastructure and services.

Anthropologically, the concept of "inclusive" cities is a tantalizing one. It speaks to the age-old struggle of marginalized groups – whether defined by ethnicity, class, or other markers of identity – to stake their claim in the urban milieu. The right to the city, as Henri Lefebvre famously articulated, is not merely a question of physical access but a deeper assertion of the right to shape and participate in the production of urban space.

Yet, inclusivity is often thwarted by the very forces that drive urbanization: the relentless pursuit of economic growth and the commodification of land and housing. Gentrification, displacement, and the privatization of public spaces are all manifestations of this tension, as cities become increasingly stratified along socio-economic lines.

The notion of "safe" cities is another complex and culturally contingent concept. Safety is not merely a matter of physical security but also encompasses psychological and emotional well-being. In many cities, particularly those plagued by high levels of violence and crime, the very act of navigating public spaces can be a source of profound anxiety and trauma, disproportionately affecting already marginalized groups.

Here, the anthropological lens reveals the intricate web of cultural norms, power dynamics, and structural inequalities that shape perceptions of safety and risk. The policing of urban spaces, for instance, is often laden with biases and discriminatory practices, perpetuating cycles of mistrust and alienation between communities and law enforcement.

Resilience, too, is a multifaceted concept that demands careful unpacking. Resilient cities are not merely those that can withstand acute shocks, such as natural disasters or economic crises, but also those that can adapt and transform in the face of chronic stresses, such as climate change, demographic shifts, and global economic restructuring.

Anthropologically, resilience is inextricably linked to the social and cultural fabric of communities, their ability to mobilize collective resources, and their capacity for innovation and adaptation. Traditional knowledge systems, community networks, and local governance structures often play a vital role in enhancing resilience, yet these are frequently overlooked or undermined by top-down development initiatives.

Finally, the notion of "sustainable" cities is perhaps the most challenging and contentious aspect of SDG 11. Sustainability is not merely a technical or environmental concern but a deeply political and ethical one, requiring a fundamental rethinking of our relationship with the natural world and a recalibration of our economic and social priorities.

Anthropologists have long grappled with the tensions between Western notions of development and the diverse cosmologies and worldviews of indigenous and traditional communities. The imposition of a particular conception of sustainability, one rooted in Western modernity and capitalist logic, risks perpetuating the very patterns of exploitation and marginalization that have contributed to the current environmental crisis.

As we strive to realize the vision of SDG 11, we must embrace the complexity and richness of human experience, acknowledging the diverse ways in which communities conceive of and negotiate their relationship with the urban environment. Only by cultivating a truly inclusive and culturally-sensitive approach can we hope to create cities that are truly sustainable, resilient, and just.
