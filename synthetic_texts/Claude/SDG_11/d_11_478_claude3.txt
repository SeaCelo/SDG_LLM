Here is a detailed newspaper article about Sustainable Development Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), written as if for The Wall Street Journal:

Urban Metamorphosis: The Sustainable Cities Imperative  

By 2050, nearly 70% of the world's population will reside in cities, exerting immense strain on infrastructure, housing, basic services and the environment. The sustainable development of human settlements has therefore emerged as one of the most pressing challenges of the 21st century. 

Rapid urbanization, particularly in developing nations, has triggered a plethora of interconnected issues - proliferating informal settlements, inadequate affordable housing, overburdened municipal resources, crippling traffic snarls, unchecked pollution levels and heightened vulnerability to climate change impacts and natural disasters. Urban areas currently account for over 70% of global carbon emissions, while generating a mere 30% of GDP. Clearly, "business-as-usual" urban development is economically inefficient and environmentally catastrophic.

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11) calls for cities and human settlements to be inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable by 2030. Achieving this audacious target necessitates a paradigm shift - from the traditional view of cities as economic engines and population clusters, to an integrated, holistic perception of cities as complex, dynamic ecosystems.

At its core, SDG 11 envisions cities as vibrant, livable spaces that afford dignified access to adequate housing, green public spaces, safe mobility options and affordable basic amenities for all residents, irrespective of economic status. Crucially, it underscores cities' role as vectors for social inclusion and equal opportunity.  

Embedding circularity and resource efficiency into urban infrastructure design and service delivery is imperative to curtail cities' environmental footprints. Bold innovations like decentralized renewable energy grids, sustainable construction materials, smart traffic management, and closed-loop waste recycling must be aggressively scaled. Investment in disaster risk mitigation strategies and early warning systems is vital to bolster urban resilience against climate shocks.

Critically, SDG 11 emphasizes participatory, integrated urban planning policies that factor in the needs of marginalized groups like slum-dwellers and the informal workforce. Its targets enshrine equitable access to affordable housing, upgraded informal settlements and expanded public transport networks. Fundamentally, it envisions cities as catalysts for socioeconomic mobility and sustainable industrialization.

Financing the staggering costs of urban revamps poses a formidable challenge, particularly for cash-strapped developing nations. However, realigning municipal budgets, leveraging green financing instruments, structuring public-private partnerships and instituting incentives for sustainable practices could catalyze the necessary investments while fostering inclusive economic growth.

Vanguard cities like Copenhagen, Singapore and Curitiba have demonstrated that strategic foresight, cross-sectoral coordination and stakeholder involvement can indeed transform urban landscapes into crucibles of sustainability and opportunity. Their successes offer a template for cities worldwide to emulate, while customizing solutions to contextual idiosyncrasies.  

The sustainable urbanization agenda underpins mankind's collective ability to mitigate existential climate threats, generate shared prosperity and cultivate social resilience in an increasingly urbanized world. Prioritizing SDG 11 is therefore an economic and moral imperative - not a choice, but a necessity for our planetary future.
