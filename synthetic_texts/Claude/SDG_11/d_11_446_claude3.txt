Swissaid, a prominent international development organization, presents this analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11): "Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable." Drawing upon our extensive field experience and research, we delve into the multifaceted challenges and opportunities surrounding sustainable urbanization.

Rapid urbanization poses a formidable challenge, with projections indicating that by 2050, nearly 70% of the global population will reside in cities. This unprecedented growth exerts immense pressure on urban infrastructure, housing, transportation systems, and basic services, threatening to exacerbate inequalities, environmental degradation, and social exclusion. Addressing these issues is imperative for achieving sustainable development and ensuring a prosperous future for all.

Inclusive and equitable cities are the cornerstone of SDG 11. Alarmingly, one in four urban residents worldwide resides in informal settlements or slums, lacking access to adequate housing, clean water, sanitation, and other essential services. Overcoming this challenge requires a multi-pronged approach that encompasses affordable housing initiatives, slum upgrading programs, and the recognition of informal settlements as integral parts of the urban fabric. Successful examples can be found in initiatives like the Participatory Slum Upgrading Program in Khulna, Bangladesh, which involved community-driven planning and the provision of basic services, resulting in improved living conditions for over 100,000 residents.

Urban mobility is another critical aspect of sustainable cities. Congestion, air pollution, and inefficient transportation systems hamper economic productivity, public health, and quality of life. Swissaid's interventions in cities like Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, have demonstrated the transformative potential of integrated urban mobility solutions, including the expansion of public transportation networks, the promotion of active modes like walking and cycling, and the adoption of intelligent transportation systems. These initiatives not only improve accessibility and reduce emissions but also foster social inclusion by connecting marginalized communities to employment opportunities and essential services.

Building resilience to disasters and climate change impacts is a pressing concern for cities worldwide. With urban areas increasingly vulnerable to natural hazards, such as floods, earthquakes, and heatwaves, proactive measures are essential. Swissaid has been actively involved in initiatives like the Resilient Cities Asia-Pacific program, which advocates for risk-sensitive urban planning, the implementation of early warning systems, and the strengthening of disaster preparedness and response capabilities. Integrating climate change adaptation strategies into urban development plans is crucial, as exemplified by our work in coastal cities like Semarang, Indonesia, where we have supported the development of resilient infrastructure and the restoration of mangrove ecosystems as natural buffers against sea-level rise and storm surges.

Sustainable and inclusive urbanization also necessitates the preservation and promotion of cultural heritage and public spaces. Cities are not merely physical structures but repositories of diverse cultural identities, traditions, and social interactions. Swissaid's projects in historic cities like Bhaktapur, Nepal, have showcased the potential of participatory conservation efforts, where local communities are empowered to safeguard their cultural heritage while generating sustainable livelihoods through responsible tourism initiatives. Additionally, the creation and revitalization of public spaces, such as parks, plazas, and pedestrian zones, foster social cohesion, promote active lifestyles, and enhance overall well-being.

Achieving SDG 11 requires multidisciplinary collaboration, innovative financing mechanisms, and the meaningful participation of all stakeholders, including local communities, civil society organizations, and the private sector. Swissaid advocates for inclusive governance models that foster participatory decision-making processes, empowering citizens to shape the future of their cities. We also recognize the importance of leveraging technology and data-driven solutions to optimize urban planning, service delivery, and resource management.

Furthermore, the interconnectedness of the Sustainable Development Goals demands a holistic approach. Sustainable urbanization is inextricably linked to other goals, such as poverty alleviation (SDG 1), access to clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), affordable and clean energy (SDG 7), sustainable consumption and production patterns (SDG 12), and climate action (SDG 13). By addressing these interlinkages, we can unlock synergies and accelerate progress towards a more sustainable and equitable future for all.

In conclusion, SDG 11 represents a call to action to reimagine and transform our cities into inclusive, resilient, and vibrant hubs of sustainable development. Swissaid remains committed to supporting this ambitious yet crucial endeavor, leveraging our expertise, partnerships, and innovative solutions to create cities that work for everyone, leaving no one behind.
