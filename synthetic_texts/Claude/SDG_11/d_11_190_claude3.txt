Here is a detailed academic response about Sustainable Development Goal 11 on sustainable cities and communities, written from the perspective of Ben Shapiro:

The 11th Sustainable Development Goal laid out by the United Nations is fundamentally misguided in its premises and solutions. The idea that we must make cities and human settlements "inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable" sounds benign on its surface. But the reality is that this entire goal is underpinned by a radical left-wing ideology that seeks to subvert traditional urban planning practices under the guise of equity and environmental consciousness. 

The core concept of inclusivity is a Trojan horse for the forced integration of communities against the free choices of citizens. By demanding that housing and basic services be made "affordable" for all, the planners are arguing for top-down interventions into property rights and fee-based urban services like public transit. This strips away economic incentives for productive economic activity and neighborhood development.

The safe and resilient aspects of SDG 11 rely on fearmongering over climate change to justify ceding greater control over urban areas to unelected bureaucrats. The calls to reduce "per capita environmental impact" of cities are little more than blind opposition to economic growth, industrialization, and upward mobility in the name of debunked climate alarmism. The focus on "green public spaces" also prioritizes central planning over organic community development.

Perhaps most pernicious is the sustainability component, which serves as a catch-all for any left-wing policy agenda item cloaked in environmental rhetoric. From "resource efficiency" to "sustainable urbanization" to "integrated policies," we see open-ended language that can be interpreted as a blank check for globally-coordinated intervention into local decision-making over housing, land use, fossil fuels, and more.

Nowhere in SDG 11 do we see any respect for freedom of association, property rights, democratic governance, or basic free market economics. It is a brazen power grab by advocates of the eco-socialist agenda to subvert thriving cities in America and westernize urban areas around the world in their own radical image.  

Proponents may point to fast-growing cities, strained municipal services, and real environmental challenges as alleged justifications. But these issues are best handled at the local level through community dialogue, public-private cooperation, and harnessing the innovative potential of capitalism - not through centralized international scheming.

Some may think SDG 11 has benign intentions, but the reality is it represents a Trojan horse to undermine national sovereignty, American civil liberties, and free market prosperity in cities worldwide. We must vehemently reject this UN overreach if we care about the right to develop our communities democratically and sustainably.
