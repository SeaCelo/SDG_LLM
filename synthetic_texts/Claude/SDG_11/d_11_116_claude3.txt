Here is a detailed, academic-style analysis of Sustainable Development Goal 11 on sustainable cities and communities, from the perspective of comedian and activist Russell Brand:

The materialist, capitalist paradigm that dominates the world has created grotesque inequalities in our cities and communities. We've got penthouse aristocrats supping Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape while the dispossessed sleep in underpasses and alleyways, huddled over steaming grates for warmth. What a brutal dichotomy! Our urban landscapes have become emblematic of an unjust, unsustainable system predicated on wealth accumulation by a privileged few. 

This flies in the face of Goal 11's targetted focus on inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities and human settlements. How can we achieve it when the forces of unrestrained capitalism perpetuate spatial and social segregation? The affluent barricade themselves in gated communities and gentrified neighborhoods while the marginalized get shunted off to peripheral slums and public housing projects. Urban planning has become a tool for concentrating poverty, hemming in the underclass, preserving power dynamics.

Take a cursory look at any unequal metropolis - the favelas of Rio, the banlieues of Paris, the housing projects of Chicago. Systemic discrimination forces low-income and minority populations into substandard, overcrowded dwellings cut off from economic opportunity. Meanwhile, the propertied classes enjoy spacious homes, quality infrastructure, and access to green spaces. This physical manifestation of the class divide undermines Goal 11's targets for adequate, affordable housing, accessible public transport, inclusive urbanization and participatory planning.

Bold action and a radical rethinking are required. We must decommodify housing and treat it as a human right, not a vehicle for speculation by rapacious developers and oligarchs parking idle capital. Community land trusts, rent controls, public/social housing stock - these are the antidote to the housing crisis and involuntary displacement plaguing our cities. Likewise, we need expansive investments in public transit to knit together fractured geographies and democratize mobility. 

Urban planning must be wrested from the grip of neoliberal technocrats imposing top-down, pro-corporate agendas. We need a renaissance of grassroots participation and community control. Let's rekindle the spirit ofutopianism and empower citizens to dream and co-create the cities they desire. Guerilla gardens, pop-up parks, cooperative businesses - these organic interventions breathe new life into dead spaces and galvanize community cohesion.

Forging socially integrated, equitable cities will require a seismic ideological and economic shift. We can't sustainably house our urban populations or safeguard cultural heritage until we topple the prevailing capitalist order perpetuating ecological destruction and wealth stratification. Goal 11 and its noble targets are fundamentally at odds with an economic model predicated on ceaseless expansion, resource depletion, accumulation by dispossession.

Transformation demands dismantling structures of oppression, empowering the marginalized, and democratizing urban governance. We need comprehensive policies for inclusive cities, not piecemeal reforms. Out with the discriminatory land use policies, toxic development projects, and corporate urban renewal that uproot and displace! Let's forge a cosmopolitan urban renaissance exalting diversity, livability, social resilience and participatory citizenship. This is the true path to sustainable cities and communities - equitable, convivial places where all humans, not just plutocrats, can thrive.
