Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), an international humanitarian organization renowned for its commitment to providing medical aid in crisis zones, has closely monitored the progress of Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11), which aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. As a frontline organization witnessing the devastating impacts of conflict, displacement, and natural disasters on urban populations, MSF offers a unique perspective on the challenges and opportunities presented by SDG 11.

The rapid urbanization witnessed in recent decades has exacerbated existing vulnerabilities and inequalities within cities, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Informal settlements, often characterized by inadequate housing, lack of basic services, and precarious living conditions, have become breeding grounds for disease outbreaks, violence, and environmental degradation. MSF's operations in these settings have highlighted the urgent need for inclusive and sustainable urban development strategies that prioritize the needs of the most marginalized communities.

Access to safe and affordable housing remains a critical challenge in many urban areas, contributing to the proliferation of slums and informal settlements. MSF has witnessed firsthand the devastating consequences of inadequate housing, including heightened risks of communicable diseases, exposure to environmental hazards, and increased vulnerability to exploitation and violence. Addressing this issue requires concerted efforts from governments, urban planners, and civil society organizations to develop affordable and inclusive housing solutions, while also addressing the underlying socioeconomic factors that drive urban poverty and inequality.

Moreover, the increasing frequency and severity of natural disasters and climate-related events have disproportionately impacted urban populations, particularly those residing in informal settlements and coastal areas. MSF has responded to numerous emergencies in cities devastated by earthquakes, hurricanes, and flooding, providing critical medical aid and supporting efforts to build resilient infrastructure and early warning systems. Achieving SDG 11 necessitates a holistic approach that integrates disaster risk reduction strategies, climate change adaptation measures, and sustainable urban planning principles.

Urban violence and insecurity, often fueled by poverty, social exclusion, and weak governance structures, pose significant challenges to the well-being of urban populations. MSF teams have witnessed firsthand the devastating consequences of urban violence, including injuries, psychological trauma, and disruptions to essential services and livelihoods. Addressing this issue requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the root causes of violence, strengthens law enforcement and justice systems, and fosters social cohesion and inclusive urban governance.

Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical importance of resilient and sustainable urban health systems. MSF's response to the pandemic in densely populated urban areas has highlighted the vulnerabilities of overburdened and underfunded healthcare facilities, as well as the disproportionate impact on marginalized communities with limited access to healthcare and basic services. Achieving SDG 11 necessitates investing in robust and equitable urban health infrastructure, enhancing disease surveillance and emergency preparedness, and addressing the social determinants of health in urban settings.

As MSF continues to provide humanitarian aid and medical assistance in urban contexts worldwide, the organization remains committed to advocating for inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities. This requires a multidisciplinary approach that addresses the interrelated challenges of inadequate housing, urban poverty, environmental degradation, disaster risk, and social inequalities. By leveraging its operational expertise and collaborating with local communities, governments, and international partners, MSF aims to contribute to the realization of SDG 11 and ensure that no one is left behind in the pursuit of sustainable urban development.
