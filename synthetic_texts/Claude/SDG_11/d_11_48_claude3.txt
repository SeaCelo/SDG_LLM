Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), written from the perspective of renowned economist Henry Ergas:

The pursuit of "sustainable cities and communities" as encapsulated in SDG 11 raises profound questions about the meaning of sustainability, the drivers of urban development, and the role public policy can productively play. As an economist steeped in public choice theory, I am inherently skeptical of grandiose schemes to centrally re-engineer complex societal phenomena through bureaucratic diktat. Cities are spontaneous orders that emerge from the decentralized decisions of millions of individuals pursuing their disparate ends through the market mechanism and voluntary association. This evolutionary process rewards the commercial acumen, aesthetics, and social technologies that align individual and group interests most fruitfully.

Historically, the great urban success stories - from ancient Athens to 19th century Manchester - blossomed organically with minimal top-down planning beyond the provision of basic public goods like security and contract enforcement. Misguided government interventions to artificially accelerate or redirect such development have repeatedly led to suboptimal outcomes, from the tenement overcrowding spawned by urban growth boundaries to the criminogenic wastelands of high-rise public housing projects. Even outwardly appealing precepts like increasing residential density often overlook negative spillovers like congestion, attenuated social capital, and loss of urban amenity. Attempting to engineer all this from above is a conceit of arrogant minds that inevitably collides with the dispersed, tacit information constraints that stymie the "fatal conceit" of centralized economic planning.

Rather than micromanaging the urban form through rigid zoning codes, growth boundaries, and prescriptive design standards, policymakers would do better to focus on establishing a reliable institutional framework that empowers bottom-up innovation and entrepreneurial discovery. This means ensuring secure property rights, flexible land-use regulations, dependable contract enforcement, and freedom of movement. It means eliminating regulatory barriers to new housing development, commercial dynamism, and transportation infrastructure provisioning. And it means undistorted pricing of road access, water, electricity, and municipal services to allocate urban resources efficiently while raising revenue for essential public goods.

By relentlessly expanding the domain of market-based negative feedback loops and private problem-solving, urban development can flexibly equilibrate the diverse and ever-shifting demands of residents, businesses, workers, visitors, and communities. Spontaneous clustering of amenities, workplaces, residences, and cultures emerges to satisfy preferences across the heterogeneity of needs and tastes. Walkability, vibrancy, housing affordability, household formation, and environmental amenities are endogenously provided in the proportions people demonstrably value rather than arbitrarily decreed from on high.

Of course, enabling decentralized urban coordination is not a panacea. All the traditional issues of market failure - public goods undersupply, tragedy of the commons, information asymmetries, uninternalized externalities - must still be carefully husbanded through targeted state interventions. The goal is judicious application of mechanisms like Pigovian taxes, cap-and-trade schemes, private property extensions, and delineation of quasi-market mechanisms for public services where appropriate. These focused tools sculpt the incentives of private actors to steer spontaneous urban development along paths reconciling economic expansion with environmental sustainability and communal thriving. They achieve far better results than naive faith in government's epistemic command over an ever-evolving metropolis.

Ultimately, the most sustainable cities are those that flexibly capitulate to the revealed preferences of empowered urbanites rather than forcing conformity with utopian visions. By fully harnessing the power of decentralized problem-solving and market processes, urban areas will dynamically realign into the diverse nexuses of commerce, culture, and community their residents genuinely favor. This is sustainability of a far richer and more organic vintage than the top-down micromanagement that SDG 11 suggests. Letting liberal democracy, economic freedom, and social dynamism flourish is the true font of prosperous, vibrant, and sustainable cities.
