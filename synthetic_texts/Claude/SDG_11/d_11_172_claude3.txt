Here is a detailed, comprehensive response in the form of a long academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 11 written from the perspective of Steve Lopez, an award-winning columnist known for his insightful commentary on urban issues in Los Angeles:

Sustainable Cities and Communities: The Elusive Quest for Dignity
By Steve Lopez

In the congested heart of Mexico City, the stench of open-air defecation hangs thick on Calle Soledad, where thousands cram into ramshackle tenements without basic sanitation. Nearly a thousand miles north, the sidewalks of Skid Row teem with the banished souls of Los Angeles, our nation's homeless capital. And from the slums of Mumbai to the favelas of Rio, human misery festers amid crumbling infrastructure and civic neglect.

Such is the wretched common denominator uniting the world's great cities in the 21st century. For all our technological marvels and material abundance, an exploding tide of urban dwellers – soon to encompass two-thirds of humanity – subsists without dignified shelter, clean water, reliable energy or physical safety. This simmering crisis of sustainable development defies borders, cultures and political ideologies. And it mocks humanity's collective failure to deliver on even the most basic promises of modern civilization.

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 11 calls for cities to provide access to safe, resilient and affordable housing, basic services, green spaces and sustainable transport systems for all by 2030. Yet around the world, local leaders strain under the pressures of unchecked growth, crumbling civic infrastructure, urban sprawl, climate change and scarce public funding. From Karachi to Kinshasa to Kuala Lumpur, the hard-knock reality on the streets belies the glossy images of gleaming towers and aerodynamic superhighways coating the urban planning brochures.

In my decades roaming Los Angeles as a journalist – engaging with the homeless, immigrant families in slum housing, and activists fighting for environmental justice – I've witnessed up close the immense challenges and competing tensions complicating the quest for sustainable cities. Equal parts tantalizing dream and maddeningly complex knot of human obstacles.

Take Downtown LA's burgeoning renaissance as a cautionary tale. A flood of eyecatching residential construction brought an influx of trendy shops, art galleries and hipster bars – revitalizing forlorn neighborhoods but driving up costs. As landlords rushed to cash in, rents skyrocketed and evictions of long-term low-income tenants spiked, fueling homelessness. The revitalized streetscapes with their glitzy highrises now harbor thousands sleeping rough mere blocks away. Progress and misery advancing in perverse lockstep.

Sustainable urbanization demands tackling generational cycles of poverty, discrimination, corruption and lack of political will. It requires forward-thinking investment in affordable housing, reliable public transit, green spaces, renewable energy and water infrastructure – all while mitigating displacement of vulnerable communities. Not to mention addressing creeping environmental perils like rising seas, droughts and wildfires intensified by climate change.

From dense African capitals to sprawlscapes of the Americas to booming Asian megacities, the challenges are at once universal and uniquely local. In Delhi or Dhaka, air pollution chokes the skies, a public health calamity born of fossil fuels, industrial grime and inadequate public transit. Indonesia's sinking Jakarta must grapple with rising oceans, coastal flooding and the forced exodus of millions. Lagos, Mexico City and São Paulo battle epic traffic gridlock and crumbling road networks as urbanization outpaces infrastructure.        

My city of Los Angeles offers a microcosm of the immense complexities in creating sustainable, equitable urban communities. Despite grand ambitions like the Sustainable City pLAn and past leadership on enviornmental action, grim realities temper optimism. The Dickensian divide between glittering condos and affluent enclaves versus the festering blight and despair of Skid Row and slums like Pico-Union and Westlake yields a jarring, soul-crushing contrast.

LA's inadequate public transportation and paralyzing car culture, its proliferation of oil refineries and smog, its paucity of public green spaces, and above all its enduring affordable housing crisis – all undermine noble intentions. Like many cities worldwide, accelerating climate change magnifies threats like drought, wildfires and sea level rise.  

Yet I've also witnessed the power of grassroots activism – environmental justice groups safeguarding communities from industrial toxins, housing advocates battling rapacious developers, and bold citizens' campaigns expanding public transit to underserved swaths of the metropolis. Progress can feel tantalizingly within reach when neighborhoods band together. 

One need only look to Seoul's bold urban greenscape transformation or Copenhagen and Amsterdam's innovative cycling infrastructures to glimpse the possibilities. Curitiba, Brazil's wildly successful affordable public transit system and Medellin, Colombia's pioneering slum revitalization inspire hope.

But such achievements remain exceptional bright spots amid a sea of daunting obstacles worldwide. From Mumbai to Manila to Mexico City to Miami – cities bursting at their seams grapple with the intertwined crises of slumlords and sprawl, transportation chaos, extreme climate vulnerability and societal upheaval as frustrated young generations seek dignity and opportunity. It's become dismayingly common to witness entire communities – sometimes millions strong – marginalized and left behind amid the churn of urban development run amok.

Building sustainable cities, by the UN's definition, means ensuring "access to safe and affordable housing, and upgrade slum settlements." This imperative feels increasingly like an intractable global emergency when one bears witness to places like Dhaka's Korail slum, where a staggering million-plus people are packed into squalid, sewage-soaked hovels between putrid canals. An entire megacity's population lingering in abject desperation.

Or consider the sheer human scale of housing scarcity in Mexico City, Manila, Lagos and Mumbai – where desperate families routinely erect shanties on traffic medians and sidewalks after being driven from settlements razed to clear space for new developments. These heart-rending scenes of urban cleansing in furtherance of "progress" play out on a daily basis across the global south.

Even in relatively affluent Los Angeles, an estimated 60,000 souls languish on the streets and tens of thousands more live crammed into sub-standard housing – despite an ostentatious real estate boom enriching developers and shelter remaining eminently affordable relative to other world capitals. The collective failure to utilize resources and political will to provide basic shelter spotlights the twisted human dimensions of the crisis.

Achieving SDG 11's target of upgrading slums while ensuring affordable housing for all remains a formidable generational challenge. From Los Angeles to Lima to Lagos, it will require overcoming speculative predations of luxury developers, instituting rent control and public housing at meaningful scale, and empowering communities to guide sustainable urban policies and investments. Those tasked with urban planning and civic stewardship must prioritize human dignity and social equity over hollow, top-down "revitalization." Community-led slum upgrading, grassroots activists remind us, is central to inclusive urbanization.

For all its complexities and maddening paradoxes, realizing the dream of sustainable cities fundamentally hinges on the most basic human ideals: promoting dignity, equality, inclusion and justice for every person irrespective of socioeconomic status. As UN Secretary General António Guterres noted, "There is a pervasive crisis of urban inequality, with intense disparities across cities and within cities."

Any hope of sustainable urban development requires tackling those disparities head on. Rectifying the injustices, institutional corruption and ingrained inequities fueling slum proliferation, housing unaffordability, inadequate transit, and environmental degradation.

Not just building public housing and homeless shelters – but empowering residents and promoting community land trusts as a bulwark against displacement and predatory developers. Not just constructing bike lanes and subways–but designing infrastructure to maximize accessibility for underserved neighborhoods while mitigating pollution hotspots. 

And urbanization strategies must proactively account for climate change risks. The most vulnerable communities worldwide consistently bear the brunt of intensifying extreme weather, droughts, floods, wildfires and heatwaves brought by global warming. Building resilience from Jakarta to Johannesburg demands investing in green infrastructure, renewable power, public cooling centers, emergency readiness and other adaptive measures to safeguard the poor.

Forging sustainable cities ultimately requires dismantling entrenched societal imbalances – boldly reforming housing policies, transit planning, regulatory schemes and public funding models to uplift the dispossessed. It necessitates embedding the ethos of environmental justice and human rights into the DNA of how cities develop and function. This transformation will not emerge through lofty resolutions or the beneficence of the elite. It will be catalyzed by the collective action of urban social movements demanding their rightful stake and empowerment in shaping more equitable cities.

The road ahead brims with formidable obstacles at every turn – greed, political inertia, finite resources and rising climate peril all loom large. Yet recent history shows sustainable urbanization is eminently achievable when communities rally around a shared vision of dignity and justice for all.

So let us draw inspiration from the slum dwellers' movement of Mumbai which fought for secure tenure and basic services. From the determined souls who secured Medellin's innovate slum upgrading. From environmental justice warriors in "toxic touring" Los Angeles neighborhoods like Wilmington who took on big oil's blight and forced a reckoning.

Meeting the immense urban challenges of our era may feel Sisyphean at times. But when civic engagement ignites and communities coalesce around a moral cause, even the most intractable ills can yield to human perseverance. That spirit of solidarity amid adversity – of demanding progress measured not by skyscraper forests but in real human development – must light the path forward.

For sustainable cities ultimately emerge not through blueprints and PowerPoints, but from grassroots movements asserting the moral right to habitable environments, shelter, civic resources and human dignity for all. With that collective embrace of justice as the true measure of sustainability, our cities – and our shared human condition – stand a chance of transcending the anguishing disparities of our modern urban age. The quest for sustainable cities is inseparable from the eternal struggle to realize our highest ideals of equality and opportunity for all.
