As the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency, we are committed to driving progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11), which aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. Our approach is multifaceted, involving collaboration with various stakeholders, implementation of innovative strategies, and a deep understanding of the unique challenges faced by urban areas in Turkey and the broader region.

One of our primary focus areas is addressing the rapid urbanization and population growth experienced in many Turkish cities. This phenomenon has exacerbated issues such as inadequate housing, strained infrastructure, and environmental degradation. To tackle these challenges, we are actively promoting inclusive urban planning and participatory decision-making processes. By engaging local communities, civil society organizations, and relevant authorities, we ensure that development projects are tailored to the specific needs and aspirations of the people they serve.

Moreover, we recognize the importance of affordable and sustainable housing solutions. Our initiatives in this domain range from facilitating access to affordable mortgages and rental assistance programs to promoting sustainable construction practices and energy-efficient housing designs. By fostering public-private partnerships and leveraging innovative financing mechanisms, we aim to make quality housing accessible to all segments of society, including marginalized and vulnerable groups.

Ensuring access to safe, affordable, and sustainable transport systems is another key priority. We are actively supporting the development of integrated public transportation networks, encouraging the adoption of non-motorized modes of transport, and promoting the transition towards clean and renewable energy sources in the transportation sector. These efforts not only contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution but also enhance urban mobility and connectivity, ultimately improving the quality of life for residents.

Resilience is a central pillar of our approach to sustainable urban development. We are actively working to strengthen the capacity of Turkish cities to withstand and adapt to the impacts of climate change, natural disasters, and other shocks and stresses. This involves implementing robust disaster risk reduction strategies, enhancing early warning systems, and promoting the development of resilient infrastructure and sustainable land-use practices.

Furthermore, we recognize the importance of preserving and promoting cultural heritage and diversity in urban areas. Our initiatives in this domain range from supporting the revitalization of historic districts and the preservation of cultural landmarks to promoting inclusive public spaces and fostering intercultural dialogue and understanding. By celebrating the rich cultural tapestry of Turkish cities, we aim to foster a sense of belonging, social cohesion, and pride among residents.

Underpinning all our efforts is a strong commitment to data-driven decision-making and evidence-based policymaking. We actively engage in research and analysis to better understand the complex dynamics of urbanization, identify emerging trends and best practices, and monitor progress towards SDG 11 targets. This knowledge is then disseminated to relevant stakeholders, informing policies and interventions at the local, national, and regional levels.

In conclusion, our approach to SDG 11 is holistic and multidimensional, addressing the interlinked challenges of urbanization, housing, transportation, resilience, and cultural preservation. By fostering partnerships, leveraging innovative solutions, and promoting inclusive and participatory processes, we strive to create cities and human settlements that are truly sustainable, resilient, and equitable â€“ ensuring that no one is left behind in Turkey's urban transformation.
