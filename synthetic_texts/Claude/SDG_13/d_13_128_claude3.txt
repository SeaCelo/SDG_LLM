Here is a long academic article about SDG 13 (Climate Action), written from the perspective of controversial British columnist Richard Littlejohn:

The Luddite Loonies Want to Save the Planet? What a Joke!

Listen up, you na√Øve ninnies and eco-mentalists. I've had it up to here with your climate change codswallop. This whole man-made global warming malarkey is the biggest con since the Renewable Heat Incentive scheme.

The pipsqueaks at the UN have set themselves another grand ambition with their Sustainable Development Goal 13 - taking "urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts." More like Unsustainable Development Gaffe if you ask me.

These johnny-foreigner jobsworths want us to spend billions sorting out the world's problems while hard-working Brits struggle to heat their homes. All to appease the ecological warriors and their unsubstantiated scare stories about rising temperatures, melting ice caps, and extinction rebellions.

They trot out the same old photographs of impoverished villages being washed away and polar bears stranded on tiny icebergs. Yet when was the last time the iceberg non-migrants could be spotted from the icy shores of Skegness? It's all smoke and mirrors, my friends.

These climate change cultists see the weather as their religion, chanting their secular mantra of "the science is settled." Well, I've got a lump of coal for the scientists peddling such apocalyptic propaganda. 

Remember the great hurricane drought? The same experts predicted Superstorm Sandy would become the new normal. Four years without a major hurricane hitting the US, and tumbleweeds blow through the UN's best-laid plans.

Then they hit us with rising sea levels. Any beachcomber worth their seawater can tell you the tides have been coming in and out for centuries. I'll believe it when I see Blackpool Beach welcoming surfers instead of donkeys.

As for their obsession with reducing emissions, I'll remind them that plants need carbon dioxide to survive. Are they anti-photosynthesis now? Next, they'll be taxing us for every breath we take.

The reality is, these environmentalist eco-bigots are using climate change as an excuse for a hysterical outburst of anti-capitalist, anti-growth, anti-Western political agenda-peddling. With big business in their sights, they'd have us all living in yak-skin yurts, breaking wind into plastic bags for our energy needs.

Thank Moses we still have some sensible folk left in this country. People who see these virtue-signalling climate zealots for what they really are - a bunch of ray-ban revolutionary bourgeois liberals, hair-shirtingly terrified of a balmy weekend in Bognor Regis.

They want us feeling guilty for keeping warm, travelling on holiday, and eating foods that don't crunch like the IPCC's latest report. But if you fall for their chicken-littling and junk science, you're frankly as potty as their climate predictions.

Time to stop pandering to these entrail-readers of the environmental apocalypse. Put away the sackcloth and ashes, pause Netflix's latest eco-drama, and join me in giving two metaphorical fingers to the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 13. Mother Nature will be just fine without their interference.

So bah, humbug, and toodle pip to that!
