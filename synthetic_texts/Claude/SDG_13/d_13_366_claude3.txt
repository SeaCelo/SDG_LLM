The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) recognizes the grave threat posed by climate change to the sustainable development of Latin America and the Caribbean. As a region particularly vulnerable to the impacts of rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and sea-level rise, concerted action is imperative to address Sustainable Development Goal 13 (SDG 13): Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.

The IDB's strategy for SDG 13 is multifaceted, encompassing both mitigation efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation measures to enhance resilience and preparedness. Central to our approach is the promotion of low-emission and climate-resilient development pathways, which involves transitioning towards renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, and promoting sustainable transportation and urban planning.

One of the IDB's flagship initiatives is the Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA) Facility, which supports the implementation of transformational, country-led climate change mitigation actions. Through this facility, the IDB has provided technical and financial assistance to countries such as Mexico, Colombia, and Peru for the development of sustainable urban mobility systems, energy-efficient housing, and renewable energy projects.

Recognizing the critical role of the private sector in driving climate action, the IDB has also launched initiatives to catalyze private investment in low-carbon and climate-resilient technologies and infrastructure. The Green Bond Transparency Platform, for instance, aims to enhance transparency and accountability in the green bond market, promoting sustainable finance and channeling investment towards climate-friendly projects.

Adaptation measures are equally crucial, particularly for small island developing states and coastal communities that are disproportionately affected by sea-level rise, hurricanes, and other climate-related hazards. The IDB has supported the development of coastal resilience strategies, early warning systems, and climate-smart agriculture practices to enhance the region's preparedness and adaptive capacity.

Furthermore, the IDB has prioritized the integration of climate change considerations into its broader lending portfolio, ensuring that all projects and programs are screened for climate risks and incorporate appropriate mitigation and adaptation measures. This mainstreaming approach extends across sectors, including infrastructure, energy, agriculture, and urban development.

Recognizing the cross-cutting nature of climate change, the IDB has also fostered regional cooperation and knowledge-sharing platforms to facilitate the exchange of best practices, promote policy harmonization, and coordinate climate action efforts across borders. The Regional Policy Dialogue on Climate Change, for instance, provides a forum for policymakers, experts, and stakeholders to collaborate on climate-related challenges and solutions.

Underpinning the IDB's climate change strategy is a strong emphasis on capacity-building and technical assistance. Through regional training programs, knowledge products, and advisory services, the IDB aims to strengthen the institutional and technical capacities of its member countries to design, implement, and monitor climate change policies and initiatives effectively.

The IDB's approach to SDG 13 is grounded in the principle of just transition, ensuring that climate action is inclusive, participatory, and benefits all segments of society, particularly the most vulnerable and marginalized communities. This entails promoting gender equality, engaging with indigenous peoples and local communities, and fostering social and economic opportunities in the transition towards low-emission and climate-resilient development pathways.

While progress has been made, the IDB recognizes the immense challenges that lie ahead in addressing climate change in Latin America and the Caribbean. Continued efforts are needed to mobilize finance, strengthen institutional frameworks, enhance regional cooperation, and promote behavioral and cultural shifts towards more sustainable patterns of production and consumption.
