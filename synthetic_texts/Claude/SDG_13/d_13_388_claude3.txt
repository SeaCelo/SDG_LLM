The World Food Programme (WFP) recognizes that climate change poses an existential threat to global food security and sustainable development. As the largest humanitarian organization addressing hunger worldwide, we are deeply committed to SDG 13 - Climate Action - and understand its profound implications for our mission and beneficiaries.

Climate change is a root cause of hunger, poverty, and displacement, with devastating impacts already visible across the regions where we operate. Rising temperatures, erratic rainfall patterns, and increasing frequency of extreme weather events are diminishing agricultural yields, degrading arable land, and compromising livelihoods, especially for smallholder farmers and pastoralists in the Global South. The convergence of climate shocks, conflict, and economic instability has created a perfect storm, pushing millions to the brink of famine.

In 2022 alone, the WFP assisted over 123 million people across 116 countries and territories, a staggering increase driven primarily by climate-related disasters, compounded by the fallout from COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine. From drought emergencies in the Horn of Africa and Sahel region to floods in Pakistan and Bangladesh, our operations are increasingly focused on responding to climate-induced crises.

Recognizing the urgency of this challenge, the WFP has integrated climate action into our programmatic approach and long-term strategy. We are working to enhance the climate resilience of vulnerable communities, leveraging our expertise in food assistance, early warning systems, and supply chain logistics. Our climate risk management tools, such as the Integrated Climate Risk Management (ICRM) approach, help communities anticipate, adapt to, and mitigate the impacts of climate change on food security.

Moreover, the WFP is collaborating with partners to promote climate-smart agriculture techniques, including drought-resistant crop varieties, water harvesting, and sustainable land management practices. In Rwanda, for instance, our Greenhouse Farming initiative has empowered over 3,000 smallholder farmers to adopt sustainable greenhouse technologies, boosting yields and incomes while reducing vulnerability to climate shocks.

Recognizing the interconnected nature of the SDGs, our climate action efforts are closely aligned with SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 1 (No Poverty), SDG 5 (Gender Equality), and SDG 15 (Life on Land). By promoting climate-resilient agricultural practices, we not only enhance food security but also support sustainable livelihoods, empower women, and protect ecosystems.

Furthermore, the WFP is committed to minimizing our environmental footprint and transitioning to sustainable energy sources. Our efforts include investing in renewable energy solutions for our operations, optimizing supply chains, and reducing food waste. In Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, for example, we have installed solar energy systems in refugee camps, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and mitigating deforestation.

While significant progress has been made, daunting challenges remain. Climate change is a threat multiplier, exacerbating existing vulnerabilities and inequalities, and disproportionately impacting the world's poorest and most marginalized communities. Addressing this crisis requires a collective and coordinated response from all stakeholders, including governments, civil society, the private sector, and international organizations.

The WFP remains steadfast in our commitment to climate action and will continue leveraging our expertise, resources, and partnerships to build resilience, promote sustainable food systems, and support communities on the front lines of climate change. Only through concerted global efforts can we achieve the ambitious targets of SDG 13 and create a more sustainable, equitable, and food-secure future for all.
