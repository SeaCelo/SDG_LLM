Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 13 (Climate Action) as if written by renowned New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd:

Losing Our Marbles to Climate Change

The planet is burning, yet our leaders continue fiddling while Rome goes up in smoke. Their negligent dithering on climate change is condemning future generations to a global apocalypse. We're approaching a scorching point of no return that could leave Earth as charred and desolate as the dark side of the moon.

A surreal miasma of climate change denial still lingers over Washington, exacerbated by fossil fuel plutocrats and obstructionist Republican Luddites. They mock the science and sneer at climate change believers, all while raking in money from ExxonMobil, Chevron, and other dirty energy behemoths. Their denialism may soon lead to more drought, flood, famine, and wildfire catastrophes ravaging the planet. Wake up and smell the carbon emissions!

Meanwhile, Donald Trump's verbal Chernobyl has unleashed a toxic cloud of anti-environmental lies, even pulling out of the Paris climate agreement. Could he really be so clueless and self-absorbed to accelerate these cataclysmic risks just to spite Obama's legacy? The answer is a depressing yes.

Trump's environmental policies embrace negligence on a planetary scale. He appointed former Coal Lobbyist Andrew Wheeler to gut Obama-era emissions standards at the EPA. His administration relentlessly pushed to increase fossil fuel extraction on public lands. That myopic greed is setting the stage for more destructive natural disasters and mass human suffering.

The latest UN climate report painted a grim picture, warning that rising ocean levels could submerge coastal cities and low-lying islands within the century. Deadly heatwaves, water shortages, and crop failures could destabilize the developing world. Food insecurity resulting from climate change could exacerbate immigration crises and armed conflicts.

The apathy and myopia from political class is disturbing. They rant about taking their country back while climate change might one day take our planet back -- resetting the scorched Earth to prehistoric conditions.

We can't let that happen. More carbon taxes and cap-and-trade systems are needed, as are aggressive investments in renewable energy and carbon capture technology. Our future is at stake; to ignore climate change is to embrace collective suicide on a global scale.

What will it take for the world's leaders to wake up, before rising temperatures cook coastal metropolises and extreme weather topples nation-states? Do Republicans think thoughts and prayers will save Miami or Shanghai when the polar ice caps melt?

If Republican deniers won't budge, then it's time for bold democratic leadership. We must treat carbon emissions as an existential threat to humanity, mobilizing whatever resources are required. I want to see a green revolution, a new generation of climate change shock troops pressuring politicians through strikes and relentless activism.

It's 2022, and we're running out of time to act before the Doomsday Clock strikes midnight. The perils of complacency are omnipresent, with the planet facing civilizational catastrophe. So let's throw out the climate deniers already! The future of life on Earth depends on seizing this crisis by the throat, and not letting go until the carbon monster is slayed.
