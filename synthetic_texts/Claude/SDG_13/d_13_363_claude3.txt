As the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), we recognize the urgent need to combat climate change and its devastating impacts, which are inextricably linked to Sustainable Development Goal 13 (SDG 13): Climate Action. Our commitment to this goal is unwavering, and we are steadfast in our efforts to mobilize resources, foster innovation, and catalyze transformative change across our regions of operation.

The challenges posed by climate change are multifaceted and far-reaching, affecting every aspect of our societies and economies. From intensifying natural disasters and rising sea levels to disruptions in food and water supply chains, the consequences are dire and require immediate and coordinated action. As a multilateral development bank, we understand the pivotal role we play in addressing these challenges and supporting our countries of operations in their efforts to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change.

At the EBRD, our approach to SDG 13 is multidimensional, encompassing a range of strategies and initiatives. We prioritize the integration of climate considerations into our lending and investment decisions, ensuring that our projects are aligned with sustainable practices and contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Through our dedicated Green Economy Transition (GET) approach, we actively promote the adoption of low-carbon and climate-resilient technologies, fostering the transition towards a greener and more sustainable future.

One of our key focus areas is the promotion of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency measures. We invest in cutting-edge technologies such as solar, wind, and geothermal power, enabling our countries of operations to diversify their energy mixes and reduce their reliance on fossil fuels. Additionally, we support the development of smart grids and energy storage solutions, enhancing the resilience and reliability of energy systems in the face of climate-related disruptions.

Recognizing the importance of adaptation and resilience, we also prioritize investments in infrastructure and urban development projects that are designed to withstand the impacts of climate change. This includes the construction of flood defenses, the implementation of sustainable water management practices, and the development of climate-resilient transportation networks. By strengthening the adaptive capacity of our countries, we aim to minimize the social, economic, and environmental costs associated with climate-related disasters.

Furthermore, we actively engage with the private sector, fostering public-private partnerships and leveraging innovative financing mechanisms to catalyze climate action. Our dedicated climate finance instruments, such as green bonds and carbon finance facilities, provide incentives for businesses to adopt sustainable practices and invest in low-carbon technologies. We also collaborate with local financial institutions, building their capacity to assess and manage climate-related risks, ensuring that climate considerations are integrated into their lending practices.

Recognizing the importance of knowledge-sharing and capacity-building, we prioritize the dissemination of best practices and the transfer of expertise across our regions of operation. Through technical assistance programs, training initiatives, and policy dialogues, we empower our stakeholders with the knowledge and skills necessary to develop and implement effective climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies.

Complementing our operational activities, we actively engage in policy dialogue and advocacy efforts, leveraging our role as a trusted partner to influence climate-related policies and regulations. We collaborate with national governments, international organizations, and civil society to promote coherent and ambitious climate action plans, ensuring that our countries of operations are aligned with global commitments and targets, such as the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

In our pursuit of SDG 13, we also acknowledge the interconnectedness of the Sustainable Development Goals. Climate change is a cross-cutting issue that impacts various aspects of sustainable development, including poverty alleviation, food security, access to clean water and sanitation, and the protection of biodiversity. As such, our efforts to combat climate change are intrinsically linked to our broader commitment to promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth across our regions.

Looking ahead, we recognize the need for continued innovation, collaboration, and unwavering commitment to address the challenges posed by climate change. As the impacts of climate change intensify, so too must our efforts to mitigate and adapt to its consequences. We remain steadfast in our commitment to SDG 13, leveraging our expertise, resources, and partnerships to drive transformative change and create a more resilient and sustainable future for generations to come.
