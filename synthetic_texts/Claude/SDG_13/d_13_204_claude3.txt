Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 13 (Climate Action) written from the perspective of conservative columnist George Will:

The Existential Threat of Climate Change Inaction

By George F. Will

My fellow conservatives, it is time we faced the reality of anthropogenic global warming and the profound risks posed by a failure to take urgent and robust action. For too long, we have stuck our heads in the sand, dismissing the growing scientific consensus as a liberal conspiracy or leftist fear-mongering. But the empirical evidence can no longer be ignored - climate change poses an existential threat to human civilization as we know it. 

Ideological blinders must be cast aside in service of harsh pragmatism. Already, we are witnessing the devastating effects through rising seas, intensifying natural disasters, droughts, famines, forced migrations, and the accelerating collapse of ecosystems upon which we depend. Time is rapidly running out to alter this catastrophic trajectory while meaningful mitigation and adaptation remains possible.

As conservatives, we pride ourselves on sober risk analysis grounded in data rather than emotion or partisan tribalism. The data points are now clear - additional warming of even 1.5°C stands to disrupt the delicately balanced climatic patterns that have allowed human societies to flourish over millennia. Worse, beyond 2°C, we face a calamitous global tipping point threatening mass extinction, collapsed agricultural systems, resource wars, and generalized social and economic upheaval engulfing the entire world in perpetual chaos.  

Do these risks outweigh transitional economic costs and temporary dislocations? Of course not. A degree of sacrifice will be required, as with any intergenerational investment for the common good. However, inaction will ultimately prove an orders-of-magnitude greater risk, both economically and existentially.  Prudent risk management necessitates taking out an insurance policy now while preventative options remain.

So let us put aside ideological fetters and culture war signaling. Turning away in denial will avail us nothing - the laws of physics remain stubborn and uncompromising, impervious to spin or political maneuvering. As the self-proclaimed "reality-based community", conservatives have a moral imperative to eschew cowardice and intellectual dishonesty in confronting one of the greatest challenges our species has ever faced. Posterity will not judge kindly those who fiddled while the planet burned.

What policies can avert this looming precipice?  Economy-wide carbon pricing, stringent emissions regulations, massive public investment in clean technologies, nature-based climate solutions, transformational agricultural reforms - all tools must be robustly wielded. Think of the monumental mobilization witnessed during World War II; we must undertake this global endeavor with greatest urgency and purpose. Any lesser effort will court unprecedented catastrophe.

Some ideologues may cry "socialism", but the market has already failed catastrophically on climate through a crisis of multi-generational externalities. Only decisive government intervention and international cooperation can reimmit us on a sustainable trajectory.  Perhaps we can productively consider market-based policy approaches, but half-measures born of political compromise will avail us nothing against this existential adversary.

Moreover, those most impacted - and yet who contributed least to the crisis - are the world's most impoverished nations. We bear a moral imperative as wealthy custodians to enact a Global Climate Marshall Plan to assist developing nations leapfrog onto clean development pathways while bolstering adaptation and resilience efforts.  Not out of charity, but cold self-interest - for making chasms of our world uninhabitable only ensures perpetual migration crises, state failures, and resource conflicts into our prosperous oases.

Conservatism rightly prizes societal stability, incremental change, and protection of civilizational inheritance. What could destabilize human civilization more thoroughly than sowing the whirlwind of unrestrained climate catastrophe? We must awaken to the direness of this challenge and take up eternal vigilance against this existential peril. History venerates those who stare frankly into oblivion and summon the courage to match it.  As ever, I remain cautiously confident in the resiliency of the conservative mind to navigate this existential inflection point with pragmatic wisdom once partisan fevers break.
