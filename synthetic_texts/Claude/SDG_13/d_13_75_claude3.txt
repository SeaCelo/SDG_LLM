Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 13 (Climate Action) from the perspective of Mark Steyn:

The Unsustainable Utopian Folly of the Climate Doomsters

By Mark Steyn

The great utopian dream of the modern secular supranational elite is to use the pretext of climate change to arrogate unto themselves vast powers over the lives of every citizen. Under the banner of confronting a supposedly "existential threat" from mild planetary warming, they seek to extinguish individual liberty, economic freedom, and national sovereignty.  

The "science" underpinning the climate apocalypse is laughably unsettled and rife with uncertainty, contradiction, and data torturing. Yet from this shaky foundation has emerged a climate dogma more puritanical and inflexible than the most severe religions of yore. We are instructed to regard anthropogenic global warming as the original sin of the modern age - caused by prosperous Western societies burning fossil fuels to power their industry, heat their homes, and enable their dynamic market economies. 

The proposed penance for this sin is nothing less than the entire reordering of human civilization. The high priests of climatism demand we put millions out of work, shutter entire industries, ration energy supply, halt economic development, cease travel, cease consumption, and return to an un-modernized buck-naked existence on the planet - with their top-down dictates controlling every aspect of our pathetically climatically-correct lifestyles.

To believe their apocalyptic prophecies requires a degree of faith inversely proportional to one's attachment to facts, data, history, and human progress. Warming is not about to render the earth uninhabitable for our species that has spread to the hottest and coldest regions of the planet. No, this is a massive ideological hustle by malign forces seeking to destroy capitalism and transfer power permanently to unaccountable supranational bodies.

Previous eco-doomsday prophesies of mass starvation, resource depletion, and population apocalypse have utterly failed to materialize. The Malthusians underestimated the ingenuity of human innovation. So too will the current coterie of climate bedwetters be exposed as mere carnival barkers peddling ideological extremism masquerading as science.  

The very undeveloped nations the climatists purport to be aiding with their regressive energy agenda will be most severely impacted - deprived of the cheap, reliable power sources required to raise living standards and life expectancy. Denying the world's poorest people access to affordable electricity is a form of quasi-genocidal misanthropy in service of an anti-human ideology.

Far from being an "existential threat," moderate warming and increased carbon dioxide levels have rendered the planet greener and vastly more conducive to plant life. The greatest threat of climate change, as always, will be humanity's ability to adapt and innovate technological solutions as needed, an imperative the alarmists actively obstruct with their constrictive policy prescriptions.

The very nations most aggressively pursuing this unsustainable utopian agenda are steadily falling into unsustainable debt, demographic decline, institutional sclerosis, and civilizational malaise. The doomed green fantasy of de-industrializing and impoverishing the few remaining productive centers of human accomplishment will not save the planet. It will merely accelerate the West's slide into brooding societal senescence, economic stagnation, and conflict with rising superpowers like China, Russia, and India unwilling to sabotage their own national interests on the altar of climate mammon.

The ultimate solution to environmental challenges will be found not through top-down coercion, but the inexorable march of human ingenuity unleashed by respecting economic freedom, property rights, and national sovereignty. What is truly unsustainable is the current ideological confiscation of individual liberty in service of a scientistic eschatology. History's dustbin awaits those who would subordinate the flourishing of the human condition to the oppressive climate cult.
