The International Red Cross is deeply committed to addressing the pressing challenges posed by climate change, as encapsulated in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 13 (SDG 13): "Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts." Our organization recognizes that the adverse effects of climate change are inextricably linked to humanitarian crises, exacerbating existing vulnerabilities and creating new ones, particularly for marginalized and disaster-prone communities.

Climate change is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires a comprehensive and coordinated response from various stakeholders, including governments, civil society organizations, and the private sector. The International Red Cross, with its global network of National Societies and extensive experience in disaster risk reduction and response, plays a crucial role in mitigating the impacts of climate change and supporting communities in their adaptation efforts.

One of the key areas of our work is enhancing climate resilience through community-based initiatives. We collaborate closely with local communities to understand their specific contexts, vulnerabilities, and capacities, and develop tailored strategies to address their unique needs. This approach enables us to leverage indigenous knowledge, empower communities, and foster a sense of ownership over the solutions implemented.

Our climate resilience programs encompass a range of interventions, including disaster preparedness, early warning systems, sustainable resource management, and green livelihood diversification. For instance, in drought-prone regions, we promote water harvesting techniques, drought-resistant crop varieties, and efficient irrigation methods to bolster food security and mitigate the impact of water scarcity. In flood-prone areas, we work with communities to establish evacuation plans, construct safe shelters, and implement nature-based solutions such as mangrove restoration to reduce coastal erosion and protect against storm surges.

Furthermore, the International Red Cross recognizes the inextricable link between climate change and human mobility. As climate-related disasters become more frequent and severe, an increasing number of people are forced to leave their homes, either temporarily or permanently. We provide humanitarian assistance and protection to those displaced by climate-related events, advocating for their rights and ensuring their safe and dignified movement, if necessary.

Crucially, our approach to climate action is grounded in the principles of humanitarian neutrality and impartiality. We strive to address the needs of the most vulnerable populations, regardless of their political or social affiliations, and advocate for equitable and inclusive climate policies that prioritize the needs of marginalized communities.

Recognizing the interconnectedness of climate change with other global challenges, we collaborate closely with various stakeholders, including governments, international organizations, and other non-governmental organizations (NGOs). We actively participate in global climate negotiations and policy discussions, advocating for ambitious and fair climate action that aligns with the principles of the Paris Agreement and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.

To further strengthen our climate action efforts, the International Red Cross invests in capacity-building and knowledge-sharing initiatives. We provide training and resources to our staff and volunteers, equipping them with the necessary skills and expertise to effectively address climate-related challenges. Additionally, we facilitate the exchange of best practices and lessons learned among our National Societies, fostering a culture of continuous learning and innovation.

Moreover, we recognize the importance of mobilizing resources and forming strategic partnerships to scale up our climate action efforts. We actively engage with donors, governments, and the private sector to secure funding and leverage their expertise and resources. By working collaboratively, we can amplify our impact and contribute to the broader global efforts to combat climate change and its devastating consequences.

In conclusion, the International Red Cross is at the forefront of addressing the challenges posed by climate change, aligning our efforts with SDG 13. Through our comprehensive approach, which encompasses community-based initiatives, humanitarian assistance, advocacy, capacity-building, and strategic partnerships, we strive to build resilience, mitigate risks, and support those most affected by the impacts of climate change. Our commitment to climate action is unwavering, and we stand ready to collaborate with all stakeholders to create a more sustainable and equitable future for all.
