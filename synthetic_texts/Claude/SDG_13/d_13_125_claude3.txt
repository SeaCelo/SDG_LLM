Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 13 (Climate Action), written from the perspective of the polemical journalist and social critic Peter Hitchens:

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 13 calls for "urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts." Yet in examining this nebulous objective, one is struck by the sheer scale of the challenges it glosses over, and the alarming ideological biases that underpin it. 

At its core, SDG 13 rests upon the increasingly dogmatic belief in anthropogenic global warming - the notion that human activities, chiefly the burning of fossil fuels, are dangerously altering the climate. The theoretical models and predictions made by advocates of this view have become increasingly extreme, ranging from rising sea levels that will submerge coastal cities to Europe's Mediterranean regions becoming arid deserts. Never has so much been predicted on so little empirical evidence.

Certainly, there are periodic fluctuations in weather patterns and temperatures that can have dramatic local impacts. The great freezes and scorching summers experienced in parts of North America in recent years may well be manifestations of such variations. But to extrapolate these into a looming planetary climate catastrophe is wholly unwarranted. It ignores the immense complexity of global climate systems that our crude computer models cannot begin to replicate or predict with any accuracy. 

Moreover, it continues the long tradition of Western liberal elites projecting their own misanthropic fears and prejudices onto the natural world. From Thomas Malthus' farrago of inaccurate predictions about population growth to Paul Ehrlich's utterly discredited claims about resource depletion and mass starvation in the 1970s, environmental doomsters have an unbroken record of being utterly wrong in their shrill apocalyptic warnings. Yet each time reality fails to conform to their bleak ideological models, they simply move the goalposts and make even more excessive predictions for the future.

One suspects that the motivating force behind climate alarmism is a deep-seated Western cultural pessimism, a nihilistic conviction that human intervention in the natural world can only lead to destruction. In Christianity's fading twilight, the environmental movement has become the predominant secular religion of our age, drawing affluent city-dwellers with a pastoral mysticism and hatred of industrial modernity that borders on the millenarian.

This is evident in the fundamentalist fervor with which climate activists attack any dissenting perspective with the modern-day equivalent of cries of "heresy!" Those of us who retain healthy skepticism about such secular prophecies of ecological doom are angrily denounced as "climate deniers" guilty of obstructing the utopian dream of a planned low-carbon global society. Scientific facts are subordinated to ideological fervour as the self-anointed climate priesthood steadily abandon the core Enlightenment principle of free inquiry in pursuit of their millennial vision.

Nowhere is this more apparent than in the extraordinary aims and rhetoric surrounding SDG 13, which calls for the mass indoctrination of students into climate fears through "education" programs as well as the final eradication of fossil fuels from the world economy - a move that would inevitably trigger economic regression, mass poverty and social unrest on an epic scale. 

Even more bizarrely, it urges the "integration of climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning." This monomaniacal insistence that every aspect of human activity be subordinated to the dogma of climate crisis provides a window into the quasi-religious zeal of the movement, now entirely detached from reasoned analysis and debate. Like the dreams of earlier totalitarian creeds, the global reconfiguration of society envisioned by climate activism could only ever be pursued through compulsory authoritarian controls tantamount to totalitarianism.

In the end, SDG 13 simply provides the latest illustration of the West's diseased obsession with self-flagellating environmentalism, rooted in a deeper cultural pathology that views human ingenuity and endeavor as something vulgar and destructive. The insatiable appetite for ascetic piety and misanthropic renunciation persists, having simply migrated from Christianity into the new secular cult of climate apocalypse. We would be wise to confront the irrational fears and ideological biases that underpin it, before the regressive policy prescriptions take even greater hold.
