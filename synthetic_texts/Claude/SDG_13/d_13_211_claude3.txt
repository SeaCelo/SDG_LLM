Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 13: Climate Action, from the perspective of economist John List:

The existential threat posed by climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing humanity. As an economist, I am concerned not just with the staggering potential costs of inaction, but also with identifying innovative policy solutions to drive substantive progress on this global issue. The 2015 Paris Agreement was a promising step, representing an unprecedented international commitment to combat climate change through emissions reductions and adaptation measures. However, current national pledges remain woefully inadequate for achieving the agreement's goal of limiting global temperature rise to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. Bolder, more ambitious actions grounded in economic principles are urgently needed.

A key consideration from an economics perspective is the tragedy of the commons dynamics inherent in climate change. Since the atmosphere is a shared global resource, the negative externalities of emissions disproportionately impact those who had no part in producing them. This misalignment of incentives results in excessive emissions in the absence of policies to correct the market failure. Applying standard economic theory, implementing a global price on carbon emissions, whether through a tax or cap-and-trade system, could realign incentives for firms and households to internalize the social costs. Leveraging insights from the literature on public goods games, I have explored using experimental economics methods to test alternative carbon pricing schemes and identify those most effective at inducing cooperation.

However, implementing an optimal global carbon price faces considerable political and economic challenges. There are concerns about emissions leakage and loss of competitiveness for economies that act unilaterally. There are also distributional impacts, as carbon pricing disproportionately burdens low-income households that spend a larger share of income on energy. Therefore, I have examined how trade policies and redistribution mechanisms could be structured to facilitate adoption of carbon pricing while addressing these equity concerns.

In addition, I have drawn upon behavioral economics to analyze why individuals often fail to adopt cost-effective energy efficiency measures, identifying sources of bias like inattention, uncertainty about future costs, and computational constraints. Using field experiments, I have evaluated different interventions like simplification, salience, and nudges to drive greater investment in home energy retrofits, fuel-efficient vehicles, and other emission-reducing technologies and behaviors.

Importantly, effective climate policy must extend beyond just pricing emissions, as technological innovation will be vital for developing affordable clean energy alternatives and removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. As an innovation economist, I have studied optimal R&D incentives and technology adoption policies to accelerate this critical innovation process. This includes not just pricing emissions, but funding basic research, supporting commercialization through targeted deployment subsidies, implementing standards and mandates to overcome market entry barriers, and facilitating international technology transfer.

Overall, I believe that economic analysis offers a rigorous framework for systematically evaluating potential climate policies, identifying opportunities for efficient, equitable, and politically-viable interventions. Through judicious use of market-based incentives, behavioral "nudges", public investments, and international coordination, we can harness the power of economics to drive the innovations and individual actions needed for achieving SDG 13. Climate change represents an unparalleled challenge – but also an opportunity to demonstrate the immense value that environmental economics can create for society.
