Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 13 (Climate Action) from the perspective of conservative commentator Cal Thomas:

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 13 calls for "urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts." As a conservative commentator and author, I have long been skeptical of the climate change agenda pushed by liberal elites and alarmists. However, after extensively researching this topic over the past year, I have come to some surprising conclusions that my fellow conservatives may find challenging to accept.

From a theological perspective, there is a strong precedent in Judeo-Christian teachings for environmental stewardship and protecting God's creation. Genesis 2:15 instructs humanity to "work and watch over" the Garden of Eden. If we truly believe the Earth is a divine gift, we have a moral obligation as conservatives to preserve it for future generations. Neglecting this duty would be an affront to our Creator.  

Scientific data makes it increasingly difficult to deny the reality that human activity is having a profound impact on the climate. Air pollution levels, rising temperatures, melting ice caps, and other measurable factors point to tangible consequences that can no longer be ignored or dismissed as a cyclical phenomenon. We must approach this objectively as conservatives valuing empirical facts over political rhetoric. Sticking our heads in the sand benefits no one.

That said, I remain deeply concerned about the solutions proposed by environmental activists on the political left. Their approaches relying on wealth redistribution, expansive government intervention, and economic stagnation are modern day cures worse than the disease. Their doomsday prophecies lack pragmatism and innovation.

Fortunately, principled conservative policies rooted in free market capitalism, profit incentives, and technological advancement offer a better way forward on climate action. We can drive renewable energy development not through liberal social engineering schemes, but by harnessing American ingenuity and realigning economic incentives.

Private sector competition and price signals are vastly more effective than command-and-control mandates from bureaucrats. Fossil fuel companies can become leaders in developing renewable alternatives when properly incentivized. After all, profit motivation is what fueled the American shale oil and gas revolution that has made us energy independent.

Nuclear power must be comprehensively re-evaluated as a viable long-term clean energy source when advanced through private sector innovation and void of regulatory obstructionism. Newer Generation III and IV reactors are exponentially safer than past nuclear plants and can provide abundant emission-free baseload power for our modern society.

Carbon capture, storage, and repurposed technologies represent another promising opportunity driven by capitalistic entrepreneurship, not heavy-handed government interventionism. We should provide targeted tax incentives for companies advancing these types of solutions.

Most importantly from a conservative perspective, we must reject the apocalyptic narrative pushed by climate alarmists that requires forsaking economic growth and individual liberty. Human flourishing and environmental progress are not mutually exclusive pursuits. Our approach adapts through pragmatic resilience, not economy-crushing radicalism.

Internationally, American leadership coupled with free market principles offers a pragmatic counterweight to bloated UN climate bureaucracies and their redistributionist aims masquerading as environmental policies. Pressuring developing countries to embrace affordable, advanced energy technologies is more realistic and impactful than utopian carbon reduction targets.

In confronting climate change as conservatives, we need not abandon our principles or cede the policy debate to liberals. Quite the contrary, aggressively promoting American free market solutions rooted in innovation offers our best path forward on SDG 13 and environmental stewardship more broadly. This is an opportunity to re-engage rather than retreat.
