Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 13 (Climate Action), written from the perspective of the economist Jordi Galí:

The Fight Against Climate Change: A Macroeconomic Perspective by Jordi Galí

The existential threat posed by climate change is undeniable. The rising levels of greenhouse gas emissions, driven primarily by human activity tied to energy production and consumption, transportation, and industrial processes, have already set in motion a series of detrimental environmental changes with severe macroeconomic implications. Unchecked, catastrophic consequences loom on the horizon, including rising sea levels, more extreme weather patterns, loss of biodiversity, food and water scarcity, and environmentally-induced human displacement and conflict. Transitioning to a low-carbon economy resilient to climate impacts is the paramount challenge of our time.  

The failure to internalize the negative externalities stemming from greenhouse gas emissions represents a colossal market failure of global proportions. Short time horizons and misaligned incentives have led to excessive discounting of future climate risks in firms' production and investment decisions. Households underestimate the impending costs as well, favoring policies focused on present consumption. Meanwhile, the uncertainties surrounding the localized impacts of climate change and the diffuse, long-term nature of the costs hamper concerted policy action. In sum, existing market forces alone cannot achieve the needed rapid decarbonization.

Shifting to a comprehensive intertemporal approach focused on dynamic stochastic general equilibrium modeling is imperative for quantifying the costs of climate inaction, analyzing the transmission mechanisms of climate impacts across time and economic sectors, and designing coordinated policy responses. The negative supply shocks precipitated by climate change, ranging from droughts impacting agricultural productivity to hurricanes disrupting global supply chains, risk de-anchoring inflation expectations and necessitate difficult tradeoffs for monetary policymakers.

Computable general equilibrium models that map climate and environmental variables to their microeconomic determinants offer tools to forecast output effects across sectors and regions. Accounting for expectations and uncertainty, they enable policymakers to compare policy costs and evaluate risk management approaches such as emissions pricing, green investment incentives, and environmental regulations against estimated adaptation and climate damage response costs.

On the fiscal front, carbon taxes consistent with the social cost of emissions represent a powerful mechanism to influence firm and household behavior. However, this is merely an opening step—complementary policies will be needed to counteract externalities and accelerate clean technology development and deployment at the scale required to meet environmental targets. Carefully crafted emissions trading schemes and green fiscal stimulus measures offer additional policy levers.

Yet the magnitude of economic transformation required to limit global temperature rise extends beyond the scope of any single nation's actions. An unprecedented level of international policy coordination will be essential. Game theory modeling highlights the risks of non-cooperative equilibria wherein nations prioritize short-term interests, slowing the transition to a low-carbon economy. Credible multilateral policy commitments, such as Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement, are critical for shifting to sustainable long-run cooperative outcomes.

For all countries, climate action must constitute an integral pillar of economic policymaking. Global macroeconomic models accounting for climate and environmental interactions are indispensable for formulating coherent, forward-looking frameworks. A steadfast, economically-literate approach marshalling the full arsenal of fiscal, monetary, and environmental policy tools offers the best path for mitigating climate risks, safeguarding macroeconomic stability, and ensuring a prosperous, resilient future for all.
