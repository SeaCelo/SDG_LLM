Climate change is one of the greatest global challenges of our time, and its impacts are felt across all aspects of society, including the vulnerable communities we work with at CARE. As an organization dedicated to ending poverty and promoting social justice, we recognize the inextricable link between climate action and sustainable development, which is why SDG 13 – Climate Action – is a core priority in our programming.

Our approach to addressing climate change is multifaceted, spanning from on-the-ground adaptation initiatives to advocacy efforts at the policy level. We understand that climate change exacerbates existing inequalities and disproportionately affects marginalized groups, particularly women and girls. Therefore, our interventions are designed to empower these communities, enhance their resilience, and ensure their voices are heard in decision-making processes.

One of our flagship programs is the Climate Resilient Livelihoods and Agriculture (CRLA) initiative, which operates in several climate-vulnerable regions across Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Through this program, we work closely with smallholder farmers, pastoralists, and other rural communities to implement sustainable agricultural practices, such as conservation agriculture, agroforestry, and water management techniques. These practices not only increase food security and income generation but also enhance carbon sequestration and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Furthermore, we recognize the importance of ecosystem-based adaptation approaches, which leverage the natural environment to buffer against climate impacts. For instance, in coastal regions, we support mangrove restoration and sustainable management, which not only protects against storm surges and sea-level rise but also provides vital habitats for marine life and supports local livelihoods.

Complementing our on-the-ground efforts, we actively engage in policy advocacy and knowledge-sharing initiatives to influence climate action at the national and international levels. Our policy experts work tirelessly to ensure that the voices of vulnerable communities are heard in climate negotiations, and that gender considerations are mainstreamed into climate policies and financing mechanisms.

One notable example of our advocacy efforts is our involvement in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process, where we collaborate with like-minded organizations and partners to push for ambitious climate commitments and ensure that adaptation and loss and damage are prioritized alongside mitigation efforts.

In addition to our policy work, we also prioritize capacity building and knowledge dissemination. Our team of climate experts regularly conducts research and publishes technical reports, case studies, and policy briefs to share best practices and lessons learned from our programming. We also organize regional and global forums, facilitating knowledge exchange and fostering cross-sectoral collaborations.

One of the key challenges we face is the need to scale up our interventions and mobilize greater resources to address the magnitude of the climate crisis. Climate finance remains a critical bottleneck, with developing countries still lacking access to adequate and predictable funding streams for adaptation and mitigation efforts. We continue to advocate for increased financial support from developed nations, as well as innovative financing mechanisms that leverage private sector investment and carbon market opportunities.

Moreover, we recognize the importance of addressing the root causes of climate change and promoting a just transition towards a low-carbon economy. Our programming increasingly incorporates elements of sustainable energy access, green entrepreneurship, and climate-smart urban development, ensuring that our interventions contribute to both mitigation and adaptation efforts.

As we look to the future, CARE remains steadfast in its commitment to climate action and the achievement of SDG 13. We will continue to work hand-in-hand with vulnerable communities, leveraging our expertise and global reach to deliver impactful solutions that build resilience, promote social justice, and safeguard our planet for generations to come.
