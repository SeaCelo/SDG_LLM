Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 13 (Climate Action) as if written by the late economist Walter E. Williams:

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 13 calls for "urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts." It's a lofty and admirable aim. However, like many utopian ideas that emerge from the UN and other international organizations, SDG 13 lacks economic reasoning and a respect for personal liberty. The UN's plans for climate action are grounded in an unfounded hysteria and represent a grave threat to property rights, free markets and personal freedom.

The so-called climate crisis is being used as a pretext to increase government control over our lives. The intellectual elite and their media enablers have been peddling doomsday scenarios about the impacts of man-made climate change for decades now. We've been told that by the year 2000, rising sea levels driven by global warming would have submerged large parts of Manhattan and Florida. Of course, that didn't happen. They predicted that climate change would create 50 million refugees by 2010. There's no evidence that occurred either. 

In reality, the temperature data simply do not support the catastrophic projections. Over the past century or so, global average temperatures have risen by around 1Â°C or less. And there's serious debate among scientists as to what proportion of that modest warming can actually be attributed to human emissions versus natural variability. Even the UN's own climate models cannot accurately explain the lack of significant warming over the past two decades.

The costs of the UN's centrally-planned climate policies would be astronomical and devastating for human wellbeing. Their agenda calls for a radical remaking of our energy infrastructure, rapidly transitioning away from reliable and affordable fossil fuels toward expensive and meager sources like solar and wind. This unfounded energy starvation would make it impossible to lift billions more out of poverty through economic growth and development.

Property rights are a cornerstone of prosperity. Yet the UN's climate plans give the green light to heavily restrict property use in the name of curbing emissions. Their policies enable regulatory overreach into every aspect of our lives, from the cars we drive to the buildings we inhabit. It's a recipe for totalitarian control over how we live, work and travel.

To support their agenda, climate activists have waged an Orwellian disinformation campaign, stoking public panic and smearing dissenting scientists who question their apocalyptic forecasts. "The debate is settled" they insist, ironically contradicting the ethos of scientific inquiry which relies on skepticism of orthodoxies. Many prominent scholars have suffered severe professional reputational damage simply for expressing data-driven doubt about catastrophic warming predictions.

A look back at the history of doomsaying reveals a disturbing pattern of manufactured crises to justify increased government control and diminished liberty. From "population bombs" to mass starvation to resource depletion, the elite's predictive record is abysmal. What they lack in forecasting accuracy, they make up for in cynical persistence. After each failed crisis prediction, they simply move the goalposts and rebrand the apocalyptic narrative under a new theme like climate change.

SDG 13 simply represents the latest strain of this centralizing pandemic being pushed on humanity. The UN and global busybody class have made clear they see climate change not as a scientific problem to explore, but as a convenient pretext for their unbridled intervention and control over human actions under the guise of ecological salvation. Self-interested governments and rent-seekers are only too happy to play along, feeding at the trough of climate profiteering.

A civil society of free individuals acting through voluntary arrangements governed by property rights is the only moral and practical way to steward environmental resources. History shows that truly environmental catastrophes, from deforestation to polluted air and water, arise not from too much economic freedom, but too little. It is the absence of well-defined and enforced property rights that incentivizes the overexploitation of resources that aren't actually anyone's private property.

If we are to make intelligent, cost-effective decisions about climate impacts and humanity's role in the complex science of climate dynamics, we must protect the free flow of ideas. We must reject the arrogant certainties and coercive imposed policies of those who would discard freedom, prosperity and human wellbeing to pursue their anti-growth, anti-carbon, anti-development agenda.
