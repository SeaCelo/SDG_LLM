Here is a detailed academic article about the Sustainable Development Goal 13 on Climate Action, drafted from the perspective of comedian and writer Mark Steel:

The Climate Won't Be Denied: A Satirical Look at SDG 13 on Taking Urgent Action  

Let's get real for a moment, shall we? The world's on a bit of a bender when it comes to the climate crisis. We've been knocking back fossil fuels like there's no tomorrow, blissfully ignoring the fact that if we carry on at this rate, there literally may not be a tomorrow for future generations to inherit this mess. It's like we've been out on an all-night rager, drunkenly setting fire to the curtains while insisting to the neighbors that everything is just fine and they should mind their own business.

That's where the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 13 comes in – a desperate bid to get the world to sober up and take some responsibility for the impending climate change hangover of epic proportions. The goal calls for urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts through improved education, disaster risk management, and, you know, actually doing something about those pesky greenhouse gas emissions. 

It's a tall order, I'll give you that. Trying to rally the world's leaders to take meaningful climate action is like trying to gather a gruppe of inebriated lads to have a meaningful discussion about feelings after watching them punch each other outside a nightclub at 3am. The odds aren't great, but we've got to give it a red hot go, haven't we?

Take the US and China for example – the two biggest polluting superpowers currently locked in an bizarre diplomatic dance-off. One minute they're swapping insults about emissions targets, the next they're haggling over trade deals that'll inevitably involve even more carbon-spewing factories. It's like two bickering spouses desperately trying to out-do each other by seeing who can set more things on fire in the kitchen.   

Meanwhile, the smaller island nations are essentially drowning in the rising tides, begging for a life raft from the wealthy countries who got blindingly rich by burning through the world's resources like there was no tomorrow. Oops, did I say that already? Well it bears repeating because the truth is, if we don't get our act together sharpish, there literally won't be a tomorrow for low-lying nations like the Maldives and Tuvalu.

And let's not even get started on the climate denial brigade - ably led by that bafflingly self-assured former leader of the free world who suggested nuking hurricanes to deal with them. You couldn't make it up! Although to be fair, if we let climate change run totally unchecked, chunks of the script might end up writing themselves in the form of catastrophic natural disasters, biblical heatwaves and our children having to live in a barely-habitable post-apocalyptic wasteland. But hey, at least the Nukem-for-Hurricanes guy stuck to his principles of sticking his fingers in his ears and shouting "la la la I can't hear you" in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence.

The sad truth is, SDG 13 shouldn't even need to exist - surely any vaguely intelligent species would have the common sense not to irreparably trash the only home it has? But here we are, merrily burning the curtains while wondering why the neighbors are shouting at us to get our act together. 

I mean, it's not like the climate has been subtle about dropping hints that we need to change our ways. Record-breaking heatwaves, decade-defining droughts, devastating cyclones - it's been lobbing climate catastrophes at us like a belligerent baseball pitcher furious that nobody seems to be paying attention to simple audio-visual aids. Short of physically rocking up and delivering an uppercut to humanity's ignorant jaw, I'm not sure what else the climate can do to get the message across.

So in many ways, SDG 13 represents a last-ditch hail mary to avert climate disaster. A frantic, global multi-lingual screaming session to get the world's drunken frat boys to stop chugging environmental devastation long enough to hear what their soon-to-be-incinerated descendants are yelling at them. Because let's face it, the 'she'll be right' approach hasn't exactly worked out so well so far, has it?

Whether world leaders will actually take the climate action they've promised is anybody's guess. I'm not holding my breath - mainly because at this rate, the air will soon be too choking and toxic to actually breathe in 20 years' time. But for once, it would be nice if the grown-ups in the room could put down the flaming toilet roll, take stock of the smoldering mess they've made of the place, and start taking lessons in basic home maintenance from Greta Thunberg and the other kids at the climate crisis kids' table who have more common sense than the entire ricketty model climate village put together.

The climate won't be denied forever. But if we keep on ignoring the reality slapping us square in the face, that reality will soon have no choice but to slap back with a venegance that'll knock the planet's teeth out and its sunglasses off. So get sober, get a mop, and get to work cleaning up your act before there's nothing left to salvage. The climate is calling time, and those of us with even a rudimentary sense of humankind's self-preservation know the right answer is to simply follow SD-Go 13's lead before it's too late. Or to put it more punchily: sort yourselves out before Mother Nature sorts you out for you.
