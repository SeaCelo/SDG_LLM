The adverse impacts of climate change continue to pose multifaceted challenges across the globe, exacerbating existing vulnerabilities and inequalities, particularly for children and youth in developing nations. As a leading organization dedicated to advancing children's rights and promoting gender equality, Plan International recognizes the imperative of addressing SDG 13 (Climate Action) through a comprehensive and intersectional lens.

The escalating frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as droughts, floods, and heatwaves, have far-reaching consequences for children's well-being, education, health, and safety. In regions grappling with water scarcity and food insecurity, climate-induced stresses compound existing developmental challenges, heightening the risk of malnutrition, disease outbreaks, and disrupted access to essential services. For instance, in the drought-stricken regions of the Sahel, where Plan International operates, prolonged dry spells have devastated agricultural livelihoods, exacerbating food insecurity and heightening the vulnerability of children, particularly girls, to exploitation and early marriage.

Furthermore, climate-related disasters disproportionately impact children and adolescents, often forcing them to relocate or become displaced, disrupting their education, social support systems, and exposing them to heightened risks of violence, exploitation, and psychological trauma. In the aftermath of cyclones and floods, which are becoming increasingly frequent in coastal regions, children face numerous challenges, including damaged infrastructure, disrupted access to clean water and sanitation, and increased vulnerability to waterborne diseases.

Recognizing the intrinsic link between climate change and gender inequality, Plan International prioritizes empowering girls and young women as agents of change in climate action. By fostering leadership skills, promoting climate education, and facilitating their participation in decision-making processes, we aim to amplify their voices and enable them to shape sustainable solutions tailored to their local contexts.

One promising initiative spearheaded by Plan International is the Youth Climate Leaders program, which equips young people with the knowledge, skills, and platforms to advocate for climate justice and drive community-led adaptation strategies. Through this program, we have witnessed remarkable achievements, such as the establishment of climate clubs in schools, where students collaborate on projects to reduce their environmental footprint and raise awareness among their peers and communities.

Additionally, Plan International has partnered with local governments and indigenous communities to integrate traditional ecological knowledge into climate adaptation and mitigation efforts. For instance, in the Amazon basin, we have supported indigenous youth in documenting and preserving their communities' ancestral practices in sustainable forest management, biodiversity conservation, and climate-resilient agriculture. By bridging modern scientific approaches with indigenous wisdom, we aim to foster sustainable livelihoods and enhance the adaptive capacity of vulnerable populations.

Recognizing the interconnected nature of the SDGs, our climate action initiatives intersect with other critical goals, such as SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 5 (Gender Equality), SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), and SDG 15 (Life on Land). By promoting climate education, empowering girls and women, and safeguarding natural resources, we strive to create a virtuous cycle of sustainable development, where progress in one area reinforces advancements in others.

However, addressing climate change requires a collective and coordinated effort involving diverse stakeholders, including governments, private sector entities, civil society organizations, and local communities. Plan International actively engages in advocacy efforts, calling for ambitious climate policies, increased investment in adaptation and mitigation strategies, and the meaningful participation of children and youth in decision-making processes.
