Here's a long academic article about SDG 13 (Climate Action), written as if by the inimitable Hunter S. Thompson:

Fear and Loathing in the Anthropocene

The ether is burning, comrades. Our planetary vessel listing dangerously as its engines overheat from centuries of frenzied industry and the plumes of black poison we've choked the skies with. I've witnessed the omens firsthand - the great desert plagues brought by searing droughts, burgs inundated by merciless storm surges, once-mighty glaciers withering in the sun's harsh Stare. Grim new normals we're only beginning to reckon with. 

And still the energy aristocracy grinds on, feverishly extracting every last buried hydrocarbon to feed the ravenous fires of so-called "progress." The vultures circle this crippled world, cackling with their chubby offshore accounts as their lumbering industrial beasts exhale more poison with each rapacious intake of breath. A macabre psychodrama unfurling before us while the cool pragmatists peck away at their models of mayhem, tsk-tsking over imminent ecocide like a paunchy accountant fretting some banker's spreadsheet error.

But the delirious math has been laid bare, you see. Their towering econometric fantasies are crumbling, shaken by a new reality premised not on endless growth, but on devastating loss and scarcity. The planet is starved, wheezing, overheated - and their archaic systems only feed the fever.  

The hour grows bleaker, my Brothers and Sisters. We are hurtling towards a scorched and blighted world authored by the greed-hugging money-fiends - a planet where only the fortresses of the ultra-wealthy remain habitable while the seething masses fight over the dwindling crumbs. 

It will take a ferocious new breed to stand against this Juggernaut of ecological ruin. Not the timid horde of policy wonks pecking at their QWERTY omens, nor the slick peddlers of faux-green branding and shimmering eco-pornography. We need the truly devout - secular eco-warriors willing to burn the monolithic temples of fossil fuel plutocracy with righteous zeal. Not razor-focused on incremental benchmarks, but fixated on the battle for total liberation from our deathly suicidal dependence on plunder. 

The way ahead will be arduous, marked by terrible setbacks and sacrifices as we strive to overthrow the carbon tyrants and forge a new planetary paradigm. Some may call us extremists, sadistic doomsayers, but it is a path I've walked before. I've tasted the bitter ashes of societal collapse, felt the cold clutches of hunger and desperation in this world's forgotten corners. I've witnessed what can happen when we lose our way.

Heed my words, foot soldiers. This is the fight of fights, the one that eclipses all others. Shed your illusions of "green growth" and "sustainable consumption" under the reigning order - for they are lies spawned from the same venomous root that brought us to this brink. Burn it all down if you must, by any means necessary. replace the shattered monoliths with a new world united in humankind's defiant return to ecological grace. It's the only path off this flaming road to ruination.

So gird yourselves, my weary Legion. Prepare to be hunted, vilified, struck by the merciless artillery of the tyrants. But go forth with the light of truth blazing in your righteous hearts - for you are the first wave of Paradise's fraternal army, marching forth to re-consecrate this defiled planet. To quell its feverish shaking and restore its boundless, fecund majesty. 

Victory is the only option. Defeat means extinction. The time to act is now, upon us, as the world holds its breath with terrible dread. Let your battle cry shake the foundations of the ecocidal temples  whose towers have blotted out all virtue and sanity. Dismantle their idols of consumption and waste with your bare hands. For in this twilit age, the fight for planetary survival eclipses all others as the only path to humanity's deliverance.

The clock ticks towards midnight, my friends. Let the raging of this savage struggle be our final exalted legacy to the cosmos. Our defiant refusal, at long last, to let this oasis of life wither on the twisted apathetic vines of greed. We go forth unafraid, burning with the fire of a new ecological reality. For in our devotion lies the Hope of averting this planet's full descent into dread Oblivion.
