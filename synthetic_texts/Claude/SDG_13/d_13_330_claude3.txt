As Korea's esteemed International Cooperation Agency, we are pleased to present this comprehensive analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 13: Climate Action. Our nation's unwavering commitment to combating the existential threat of climate change is reflected in our strategic initiatives and collaborative efforts on the global stage.

Recognizing the urgency of the climate crisis, South Korea has taken decisive steps to transition towards a low-carbon economy. Our nation's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement outlines ambitious targets, including a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 2018 levels by 2030. This ambitious goal is underpinned by a robust policy framework that promotes renewable energy, energy efficiency, and sustainable transportation.

South Korea's Renewable Energy 3020 Plan, for instance, aims to increase the share of renewable energy in the country's energy mix to 20% by 2030. This ambitious target is being pursued through a combination of policy measures, including feed-in tariffs, renewable portfolio standards, and tax incentives. Moreover, our nation is a global leader in the development and deployment of cutting-edge technologies such as solar photovoltaics, wind power, and energy storage systems.

Complementing our efforts in the energy sector, South Korea has implemented a comprehensive Green New Deal initiative that encompasses various sectors, including transportation, buildings, and industry. The transition to electric vehicles (EVs) is a cornerstone of this strategy, with ambitious targets for EV adoption and the deployment of charging infrastructure. Our nation is also at the forefront of developing hydrogen fuel cell technology, positioning us as a leader in the transition towards a sustainable transportation sector.

South Korea's commitment to climate action extends beyond our domestic efforts. As a responsible global citizen, we are actively engaged in international cooperation and knowledge-sharing initiatives to support developing countries in their climate mitigation and adaptation efforts. Our bilateral and multilateral partnerships focus on capacity-building, technology transfer, and financial assistance, enabling our partners to embark on their own low-carbon development pathways.

One notable example is our collaboration with the Green Climate Fund (GCF), to which South Korea is a major contributor. Through the GCF, we have supported numerous projects in developing countries, ranging from renewable energy deployment to climate-resilient agriculture and disaster risk management. Our nation's expertise in areas such as energy efficiency, smart grids, and water resource management has proven invaluable in these collaborations.

Moreover, South Korea is actively involved in various regional and global initiatives aimed at addressing climate change. We are a founding member of the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), an international organization dedicated to promoting sustainable economic growth and environmental conservation. Through the GGGI, we share best practices, facilitate knowledge exchange, and support capacity-building efforts in developing countries.

Our commitment to climate action is further exemplified by our active engagement in multilateral forums, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). South Korea's representatives play a crucial role in shaping the global climate agenda, advocating for ambitious targets and evidence-based policymaking.

Looking ahead, South Korea remains steadfast in its pursuit of SDG 13, recognizing that climate action is inextricably linked to sustainable development across all sectors. We are committed to strengthening our domestic efforts while expanding our international collaborations, fostering global partnerships, and promoting knowledge exchange to accelerate the transition towards a climate-resilient future.
