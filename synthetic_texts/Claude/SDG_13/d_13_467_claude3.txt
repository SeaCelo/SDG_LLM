Climate Crisis: A Consumer's Survival Guide
By the Consumer Reports Editorial Team

For decades, scientists have sounded the alarm bells about the catastrophic impacts of unchecked climate change. From rising sea levels and intensifying natural disasters to food and water insecurity, the very life support systems that allow humanity to thrive are at risk. And it's consumers who will bear the brunt of these cascading global threats.

We're already witnessing the devastating consequences play out. More frequent and severe heat waves, droughts, wildfires, and flooding events have directly impacted millions worldwide. Insurance rates continue to skyrocket as the costs of climate-related damages mount. Global supply chain disruptions are driving up the prices of consumer goods and basic commodities. The writing is on the wall: climate change poses an existential risk to our way of life as consumers.

So what's a concerned consumer to do? While global policy coordination at the government and corporate level is critical, individual choices and consumer activism can create powerful momentum toward solutions. Here's a road map for how to navigate the climate crisis through an educated consumer's lens:

Transportation
The vehicles we drive have an outsize impact on our carbon footprints. Ditching gas-guzzling SUVs and trucks for electric vehicles (EVs) is one of the biggest climate-fighting actions consumers can take. The latest EVs offer ranges over 300 miles on a full charge, putting mythsaround"range anxiety" to rest. With operating costs 60% lower than gas-powered cars, the top-rated EVs can save consumers up to $15,000over the lifespan of the vehicle.

Greener modes of transportation like public transit, cycling, and walkability should also be high priorities when weighing housing and commuting choices. The latest consumer data analytics allow homebuyers to score neighborhoods based on sustainability metrics like emissions and transit access.

Home Energy
Our homes account for around 20% of greenhouse gas emissions through electricity, heating, and cooling usage. Transitioning to renewable energy sources like residential solar and geothermal heat pumps can effectively eliminate a household's carbon footprint while providing long-term cost savings.

For existing homes, basic weatherization upgrades like insulation and energy-efficient windows offer near-instant returns on investment by reducing energy bills. Smart home devices that automatically optimize energy usage are worth considering as well. From smart thermostats to connected LED light bulbs, these technologies make green living more effortless and affordable.

Food Consumption 
The modern food system is a major driver of deforestation, biodiversity loss, and greenhouse gas emissions. Reducing consumption of meat and dairy products in favor of plant-based alternatives is one of the most impactful dietary shifts consumers can make for the climate.

Today's shoppers have a wealth of high-quality vegan and vegetarian meat substitutes to choose from. Brands like Impossible and Beyond have cracked the code on replicating the taste and texture of beef and chicken using plant-based ingredients. For the eco-conscious consumer, these innovative protein sources offer a seamless path to lowering their carbon foodprint.

Consumer Activism
Ultimately, the climate solutions we desperately need will require policy interventions that discourage further environmental destruction and accelerate the adoption of clean energy and sustainability measures. History has shown that concerted consumer activism can reshape industry practices and drive government action at all levels.

From pressuring public companies to disclose their climate impacts to supporting brands with credible carbon neutrality commitments, organized consumer voices hold tremendous sway. Class-action lawsuits targeting corporate greenwashing and disinformation campaigns have proliferated, levying tangible financial penalties on bad actors. Harnessing social media can also turbocharge activist causes around issues like fossil fuel subsidies and monoculture agriculture.

The bottom line is that for proactive and engaged consumers, myriad tools and strategies exist to safeguard your financial interests and quality of life from the ravages of climate change. We owe it to ourselves and future generations to deploy these tactics and rewrite the collective narrative on environmental stewardship from the ground up.
