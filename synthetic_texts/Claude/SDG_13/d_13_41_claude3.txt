Here is a draft long academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 13 (Climate Action), as if written by Piers Akerman:

The Unsustainable Agenda Behind the UN's Climate Alarmism

By Piers Akerman, Distinguished Fellow at the Institute for Common Sense Policy

The United Nations and its band of eco-evangelists have been sounding the alarm about catastrophic climate change for decades now. Their latest crusade comes in the form of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a grandiose scheme that aims to reshape civilization itself under the guise of saving the planet. At the heart of this utopian agenda lies SDG 13 on Climate Action.

Let's start by dissecting the Orwellian language employed by the UN's literati. Rebranding the climate change theory as "climate action" is a classic case of linguistic manipulation – presupposing that the science is settled and all that remains is to act. This intellectual dishonesty should be a red flag for any rational observer. 

The climate models peddled by the UN's bureaucrats rely on worst-case emissions scenarios that have been consistently outstripped by reality. Actual temperature observations from satellites and weather balloons simply don't support the doomsday prophecies conjured up in these models. Ice caps, sea levels, hurricane activity – the empirical evidence consistently defies the climate alarmists' claims.

Yet the UN persists in its climate jeremiads, anchoring SDG 13's targets to limiting global temperature rise and promoting utterly fanciful ideas like ending fossil fuel subsidies and promoting renewable energy sources. This climate tunnel vision ignores the holistic costs and real-world tradeoffs of such policies.

Abandoning reliable and affordable energy like coal, oil, and natural gas would be an economic disaster for both developed and developing nations. Millions could be condemned to perpetual energy poverty and underdevelopment in the name of climate ideology. Just ask the Europeans reeling from soaring electricity bills and fuel shortages triggered by reckless renewable policies.

The UN's brand of environmental colonialism also disproportionately impacts marginalized communities, driving up the cost of living while curtailing economic opportunity. From restricting land use to halting infrastructure projects, the climate agenda's casualties are predominantly the most vulnerable segments of society.

At its core, the SDG framework represents a utopian attempt at global social engineering, with climate change being the prime vehicle for concentrating power into unaccountable institutions like the UN. We've seen this movie before – faceless bureaucrats formulating grandiose plans that inevitably lead to misery, shortages, and authoritarian control when implemented.

The UN's response to pushback is always the same: browbeating nations into compliance by weaponizing concepts like "climate justice" and pursuing backdoor methods of climate reparations and wealth redistribution. All under the sanctimonious pretext of environmental virtue signaling.

It's time to call out this climateChangeChangemascarded power grab for what it is. Rather than contorting our societies for the sake of dubious comuputer model predictions, we should pursue rational policies that balance environmental prudence with economic viability and human welfare. Otherwise, the true climate crisis may well be the unsustainable agenda fomented by theUN itself.
