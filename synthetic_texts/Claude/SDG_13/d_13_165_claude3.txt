Here is a long academic article about SDG 13 (Climate Action) as if written by satirical novelist Carl Hiaasen:

Well butter my backside and call me a biscuit, we're really in the soup now when it comes to this climate change malarkey. And let me tell you, folks, it's getting just about as sticky as a summer day in the Everglades. The signs are everywhere if you've got the sense to see them. Temperatures so hot you could fry an armadillo on the sidewalk. Drought conditions so dry even the tumbleweeds got tumbleweeds. Storms with windier farts than a cowboy who ate too many beans.

But hey, don't take my word as a half-baked Florida cracker about to get baked right off the map. The real brainiacs with their fancy degrees and science jibber-jabber have been sounding the alarm for decades now. Lord knows we've had enough royal commissions, studies, and reports to whisker a whole herd of walruses. Hell, even that group of number wizards at the UN finally got hip to the jive with their Sustainable Development Goal 13 - you know, the one about taking "urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts."

Well pardon me, Guv'nor, but aren't we about a few decades too late for "urgent" anything? It's like trying to pants a greased weasel at this point. The whole scenario makes about as much sense as a dang-blasted mud fence. Those earnest UN folks must be sweatier than a mule skinner in July, trying to get all these ramshackle nations to cooperate on curbing emissions, when half of them can't even agree if the sky is blue or just a deeply bruised shade of periwinkle.

And you know who the real culprits are in this whole fustercluck? That's right, my capitalist-lovin', money-grubbin' friends - it's those big-shot corporations and shammed nations spewing out greenhouse gases like teenage boys at an all-you-can-eat chili cook-off. Fossil fuel fatcats, deforestation barons, and industrial world powers locked in a cow-chip contest to see who can let loose the biggest climate-changin' cloud of noxious gas before the whole planet chokes on it. It's an actual race to the bottom, and the winner gets a lump of coal in the ozone layer.

Now, I'm just a humble Miami novelist, but even I can see we're mere inches away from going full Waterworld up in here. The seas are rising, and it won't be long before Floridian condos are just overpriced bathtub toys. Maybe those millionaires can hire the Navy SEALs to install some snazzy maritime elevators - make it an exclusive aquatic community. Ooh, I can see the listing now: "Venice-on-the-Atlantic. New ultra-luxury water villas, including complementary SCUBA gear and sea monkeys."

Of course, some overly tanned beach-bum developer will still try to convince folks it's "just a little water situation." Then hurricanes like '92's Andrew will seem like a spring zephyr compared to Stormaggeddon XVI - Electric Boogaloo. We're talking atmospheric pugilists throwing haymakers of hail, torrents of torqued tornadoes, and hypercanes hyper-ventilating across entire continents like an Olympian with a severe panic disorder.

But sure, let's keep on burning and churning out all that wonderful coal, oil, and natural gas. Because obviously the solution to climate change is just outright denying it until the very fabric of existence itself gets vaporized into a thin mist of subatomic particles! And who cares if islands are sinking, crops are wilting, and the polar bears pull up chairs at the Equator? We have our priorities, damn it - like making sure big-box stores and condo complexes remain fully stocked with discount plastic crap from China while we asphyxiate ourselves into oblivion.

Yet I still have a sliver of hope that we humans will get it together before it's too late. A glimmer of optimism that maybe - just maybe - we'll stop letting greed and apathy strangle the life out of this mud ball before we're all up a familiar creek without a paddle. Because, really, what other option is there besides full-blown climate collapse, societal upheaval, resource wars, and permanent residency on the Red Planet? I, for one, have no intention of living out my golden years in a dusty Martian dreamscape subsisting on nothing but freeze-dried taquitos and Tang.

So let's quit dragging our fins and get proactive, people. Curb emissions, switch to renewable energy, and for Pete's sake, invest in industries that won't skin us alive for short-term profit. Give the rainforests a breather, plant a freakin' tree once in a while, and tell those smarmy big-wigs in the fossil fuel cabal to shove their fracking where the sun don't shine. Stop treating this planet like a filthy bachelor pad - it's our only home, so maybe it's high time we start picking up after ourselves.

It's going to take some serious grit, gumption, and creative problem-solving to confront this colossal challenge, but dammit, we're human beings - apex chowderheads of the animal kingdom! If earthworms and fungi can successfully terraform entire continents over millions of years, then surely we adaptable hairless apes can put our pumpkin-sized cerebrums to better use than continually crapping where we eat. Unless we want our legacy to be codified as restroom stall graffiti on a post-apocalyptic monument reading: "We knew exactly what the problem was, but dealing with it was just too darn inconvenient. So we kicked the can down the road until there was no more road left. And then we expired from heat stroke."

I'd like to see a heartier epitaph than that, wouldn't you? Because life's too short - or it will be if we don't deal with the climate elephant in the room. So get unstuck from your dumb inertia already! Call your senators, march with signs (avoiding Sharpie fumes), boycott Earth-killing industries, invent cleaner technologies, and vote like your life and future depend on it. Because news flash, they absolutely do. The clock's tickin', folks, and if we fumble this football now, the only "sustainable" thing we'll have achieved is a one-way trip to uninhabitable subsistence. Now doesn't that make you want to break out into an underpants-dervish of action?

Or we can just keep whistling past the graveyard with our thumbs comedically stationed in our backsides. But when the inevitable apocalyptic fire tornadoes come twirling through the neighborhood, don't say ol' Carl didn't try to warn you with his utmost Cassandra crassness. I gave it to you straight, no chaser - a sobering souvenir of South Florida satire to shove between the couch cushions of your global ennui. 

At the end of the day, we're like drunks passed out in the environmental flophouse, obliviously pissing ourselves while the entire building goes up in flames.  But hey, at least that's one way to beat the heat.
