The International Organization for Migration (IOM) recognizes the critical importance of addressing climate change and its multifaceted implications for human mobility. As the leading intergovernmental organization in the field of migration, we are committed to supporting the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goal 13 (SDG 13), which aims to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.

Climate change is a global phenomenon with far-reaching consequences, and its effects are disproportionately felt by the most vulnerable populations, including migrants, displaced persons, and communities in developing countries. Rising sea levels, increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, droughts, and other climate-related hazards are already driving displacement and migration patterns worldwide.

The IOM's approach to SDG 13 is multifaceted, recognizing the complex interplay between climate change, environmental degradation, and human mobility. We work closely with member states, international organizations, and local stakeholders to develop and implement comprehensive strategies that address the root causes of climate-induced migration, while also providing assistance and protection to those already affected.

One of our key priorities is to enhance the resilience and adaptive capacity of communities to climate-related hazards and natural disasters. This involves supporting sustainable livelihood initiatives, promoting climate-smart agricultural practices, and investing in disaster risk reduction measures. By strengthening the ability of communities to withstand the impacts of climate change, we aim to reduce the need for forced displacement and mitigate the potential for conflict over scarce resources.

Furthermore, the IOM plays a crucial role in facilitating safe, orderly, and regular migration pathways for those affected by climate change. This includes advocating for the inclusion of climate-induced displacement in national and international policy frameworks, as well as providing tailored support and assistance to migrants and displaced persons.

Our efforts also extend to addressing the specific vulnerabilities of migrants and displaced persons in the context of climate change. We work to ensure that their rights and dignity are upheld, and that they have access to essential services, such as health care, education, and livelihood opportunities, in their host communities.

The IOM recognizes the importance of fostering partnerships and collaborations to effectively address the challenges posed by climate change and human mobility. We actively engage with governments, civil society organizations, academic institutions, and the private sector to share knowledge, promote best practices, and leverage collective resources.

Through our global presence and extensive network, the IOM is well-positioned to contribute to the achievement of SDG 13 by addressing the complex nexus between climate change and human mobility. We remain committed to working tirelessly to mitigate the impacts of climate change, protect the rights and well-being of migrants and displaced persons, and build resilient and sustainable communities worldwide.
