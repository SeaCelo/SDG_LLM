As the preeminent multilateral development finance institution, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) recognizes the paramount urgency of addressing climate change and its multifaceted impacts. Sustainable Development Goal 13 (SDG 13), which calls for "urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts," is a cornerstone of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and a strategic priority for the IBRD.

The IBRD's approach to SDG 13 is multidimensional, encompassing mitigation, adaptation, and resilience-building efforts across sectors and regions. Our analytical frameworks and investment strategies are grounded in the latest scientific evidence and aligned with the Paris Agreement's objectives of limiting global temperature rise to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, while pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5°C.

Mitigation efforts are crucial to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and transitioning towards low-carbon, climate-resilient development pathways. The IBRD's portfolio includes investments in renewable energy infrastructure, energy efficiency measures, sustainable urban planning, and the promotion of carbon pricing mechanisms. Our analytical tools, such as the Carbon Pricing Assessment Tool (CPATool), assist countries in evaluating the potential impacts and trade-offs of carbon pricing policies, enabling informed decision-making.

However, mitigation alone is insufficient to address the escalating risks posed by climate change. Adaptation measures are essential to enhance the resilience of communities, economies, and ecosystems to the adverse effects of climate change. The IBRD's adaptation portfolio spans a wide range of interventions, including climate-smart agriculture, integrated water resource management, coastal zone protection, and disaster risk management.

One illustrative example is the Mozambique Coastal Cities and Climate Resilience Project, which aims to enhance the resilience of coastal cities to climate-related hazards, such as sea-level rise, storm surges, and coastal erosion. This project encompasses interventions like the construction of coastal protection infrastructure, the establishment of early warning systems, and the strengthening of institutional capacities for climate-resilient urban planning.

Furthermore, the IBRD recognizes the intersectionality of climate change with other SDGs, and our interventions are designed to promote co-benefits and synergies. For instance, our support for sustainable forest management and landscape restoration not only contributes to climate change mitigation through carbon sequestration but also supports biodiversity conservation, water security, and the livelihoods of forest-dependent communities, aligning with SDGs 15 (Life on Land) and 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation).

The IBRD's approach to SDG 13 is underpinned by a strong emphasis on knowledge generation, capacity building, and policy dialogue. Our analytical work, such as the Groundswell reports, provides critical insights into the potential impacts of climate change on internal migration patterns, informing evidence-based policymaking. Additionally, we collaborate with partner organizations, academia, and civil society to foster knowledge exchange, promote innovative solutions, and amplify the voices of vulnerable communities.

Recognizing the global scale and interconnectedness of climate change, the IBRD actively engages in international climate finance mechanisms, including the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF). Our contributions to these funds support developing countries in their efforts to combat climate change and promote sustainable development.

Moreover, the IBRD plays a catalytic role in mobilizing private sector investments towards climate-resilient and low-carbon development pathways. Our de-risking instruments, such as

 partial risk guarantees and policy-based lending, create enabling environments for private sector participation in climate-related projects, leveraging additional sources of financing.

Nonetheless, the challenges posed by climate change are immense, and the IBRD's efforts must be continuously adapted and scaled up to meet the evolving needs of our client countries. We remain committed to strengthening our analytical capabilities, expanding our toolkit of climate finance instruments, and fostering innovative partnerships to accelerate progress towards SDG 13 and the broader 2030 Agenda.

In conclusion, the IBRD's multifaceted approach to SDG 13 reflects the institution's deep commitment to combating climate change and its impacts. Through a combination of mitigation, adaptation, and resilience-building interventions, coupled with robust analytical work, capacity building, and strategic partnerships, the IBRD continues to play a pivotal role in supporting countries' efforts to transition towards climate-resilient and low-carbon development pathways.
