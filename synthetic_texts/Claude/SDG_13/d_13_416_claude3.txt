Helpage International's analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 13: Climate Action

As the world grapples with the unprecedented challenges posed by climate change, the urgency to take decisive action has never been more pressing. The adverse impacts of rising temperatures, erratic weather patterns, and extreme climatic events are disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations, particularly older persons. Helpage International, a global network dedicated to promoting the rights and well-being of older people, recognizes the critical importance of addressing climate change through a holistic and age-inclusive lens.

The climate crisis is a multifaceted issue that intersects with various aspects of sustainable development, posing significant risks to the health, safety, and livelihoods of older adults. In many developing countries, older persons often rely on climate-sensitive sectors such as agriculture and subsistence farming for their livelihoods, making them particularly vulnerable to the effects of droughts, floods, and other climate-related disasters. Additionally, older individuals are more susceptible to heat-related illnesses, exacerbated respiratory conditions, and the spread of vector-borne diseases due to their physiological and socioeconomic vulnerabilities.

Moreover, the displacement and migration caused by climate-induced events can disrupt social support systems, leaving older persons isolated and without access to essential services and care. This is particularly concerning in regions where conflicts or humanitarian crises compound the challenges faced by aging populations.

Recognizing the urgency of the situation, Helpage International has been at the forefront of advocating for age-inclusive climate action and promoting the resilience of older persons. Our organization has actively engaged with governments, policymakers, and international organizations to emphasize the importance of incorporating the needs and perspectives of older adults in climate adaptation and mitigation strategies.

One of our key initiatives has been the promotion of age-inclusive disaster risk reduction (DRR) strategies. By collaborating with local communities and leveraging the traditional knowledge and experiences of older persons, we have developed context-specific approaches to disaster preparedness, early warning systems, and resilient infrastructure. These initiatives have proven instrumental in enhancing the adaptive capacity of communities and ensuring that older individuals are not left behind in the face of climate-related emergencies.

Furthermore, Helpage International has been a driving force in advocating for the integration of age-inclusive considerations in national adaptation plans (NAPs) and nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. By highlighting the unique vulnerabilities and capacities of older persons, we have encouraged policymakers to adopt a life-course approach to climate action, ensuring that adaptation and mitigation measures address the specific needs of all age groups.

Complementing our advocacy efforts, Helpage International has actively engaged in capacity-building and knowledge-sharing initiatives. We have facilitated training programs and workshops to equip older persons with the skills and knowledge necessary to adapt to changing climatic conditions, such as sustainable agricultural practices, water management techniques, and climate-resilient livelihoods. Additionally, we have prioritized intergenerational knowledge transfer, recognizing the invaluable traditional ecological knowledge possessed by older adults and its potential to inform culturally-appropriate climate solutions.

While significant progress has been made, the battle against climate change is far from over. Helpage International remains committed to amplifying the voices of older persons and ensuring their meaningful participation in climate action at all levels. We recognize that addressing the climate crisis is not only an environmental imperative but also a matter of social justice and human rights, requiring inclusive and equitable approaches that leave no one behind.
