Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 13 - Climate Action, as if written by renowned demographer and social commentator Bernard Lord Salt:

The Rising Tide of Responsibility: Climate Action and the Crosscurrents of Generational Change  

By Bernard Salt, Demographer & Social Commentator

The 21st century challenge regarding climate change is existential. Not only does it strike at the very survival of humanity and biodiversity on this planet, but it lays bare the cracks emerging between old power structures and an ascendant generational cohort for whom environmental preservation is non-negotiable. The youth of today are climate change's greatest stakeholders - it is they who must live longest with its consequences. And it is through the lens of intergenerational transition that SDG 13 - Climate Action must be framed and understood.  

Let's start with some baseline context. My generation, the Baby Boomers born 1946-1964, grew up witnessing the post-war economic miracle and the associated industrialization that generated unprecedented prosperity...and greenhouse gas emissions. We craved convenience, mobility, disposability - all of which came at a brutal environmental cost largely dismissed at the time. Then there's Gen X after us, born 1965-1979, whose peak consumption years from the 1990s onward fueled the cheap Asian manufacturing boom that turbocharged global trade and emissions. Even older Millennials born through the 80s embraced consumerism and globalization. 

In stark contrast, younger Millennials and Gen Z have come of age bearing full witness to climate change's catastrophic local impacts - from rapidly intensifying wildfires, droughts and cyclones, to the startling loss of biodiversity on land and in our oceans. Every day, another apocalyptic news headline fans the flames of their environmental angst. No longer are discussions around sustainability an abstract concept - it is an existential crisis that will define their lifetimes. And their anger at older generations is palpable.

As leading British environmentalist David Attenborough bluntly stated: "Every day brings more evidence that climate change is happening, that it's accelerating, and that it has already become a real threat...Addressing this global issue is ultimately up to the world's next generation."  

Indeed, the furious momentum behind grassroots movements like School Strike for Climate, driven overwhelmingly by passionate youth activists, reflects the seething impatience of tomorrow's custodians at the perceived inaction of today's powers that be. For them, the climate emergency is not some economic or political issue to be debated and dissected - it is a dereliction of duty to protect their future by those currently in charge. A betrayal of guardianship.  

The challenge for global leaders is to channel this youthful zeal into meaningful action aligned with SDG 13's objectives. After all, it calls for integrated policies and strategies to improve resilience and adaptation capabilities, mainstreaming these measures into overarching development plans. Easier preached than achieved given divergent national interests at play. 

Still, there are grounds for optimism. Greta Thunberg's blunt rhetoric and emotive activism has irrevocably shifted the Overton window around climate discussion, removing any veneer of complacency. Crucially, her leaning on intergenerational justice arguments has found fertile ground with the youth psyche.

In Australia, our future citizens are doubling down on values-aligned career choices and consumption habits, eschewing industries and brands misaligned with their environmental ethos. And they apply this litmus test not just to corporates, but to entire sectors - witness the university stampede away from outdated resource courses into sustainability-oriented degrees.  

For example, petroleum engineering enrolments at the University of Western Australia cratered from over 600 in 2013 to just 26 in 2020. Meanwhile, new courses like UWA's Bachelor of Environmental Design were inundated with over 1,650 first preferences in 2020. This dramatic swing speaks to a profound intergenerational mindset shift that businesses ignore at their peril. Those getting ahead of this curve will be rewarded with a formidable source of emerging talent.

Ultimately, climate action is the supreme political, economic and social disruptor of our age. A Battle Royale pitting old wealth against new purpose. Unbridled consumption versus sustainability. What chance does the planet stand in this clash of civilizations?

In my view, the rising tide of youthful, ethically-driven social activism coupled with emerging technological breakthroughs offers a persuasive counter-narrative to brooding pessimism. But those presiding over the old order would be wise to heed the immortal proverb: "Don't try to define the change, because the change will define you."
