Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 13 (Climate Action) as if written by the scholar Victor Davis Hanson:

The Clash of Civilizations and Climate Change

In the decades following the Cold War, the world thought it had overcome the age-old plague of civilizational conflict, ushering in a new era of globalization and cooperation. Yet the 21st century is proving that the opposing forces that have riven cultures throughout human history remain as intractable as ever. The most existential struggle of our times is not between capitalist and communist nations, nor democracies and autocracies, but rather the battle between those who would preserve the modernway of life and those who would return us to an ancient eco-primitivism. 

The development of industrialized society, from the harnessing of fossil fuels to the mass production of consumer goods, has lifted billions out of subsistence poverty and liberated humanity from a Hobbesian existence that was "poor, nasty, brutish and short." The ability to cheaply generate power, transport resources over vast distances, and manufacture products en masse created a virtuous cycle of innovation, economic growth, and increased living standards never before witnessed. For the first time, huge swaths of the global population enjoyed heretofore unimaginable security, comfort, and prosperity. 

Yet this very success contained the seeds of its own potential undoing. In extracting and burning hydrocarbons on an epic scale, industrial civilization has inadvertently triggered sweeping changes to the earth's atmosphere and climate systems. The effects are increasingly visible: rising seas, strengthening storms, melting permafrost and glaciers, and shifting weather patterns. Unless decisive action is taken to curb greenhouse gas emissions, climatologists warn, the catastrophic impacts on food and water security, public health, economic stability, and national defense could spawn resource wars, mass human migrations, and societal collapse on a biblical scale.

So we find ourselves at a crossroads, faced with an existential dilemma of sacrificing our modern ways of life to save the planet that sustains those very ways of life. The impasse pits those who seek to preserve the status quo of energy-intensive economic growth against those who believe we must radically reinvent human civilization along sustainable lines of resource conservation, limits to consumption, and technological innovation to generate renewable power and reach net-zero emissions.

The latter group has coalesced around the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, with SDG 13 calling for "urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts." Global policymakers have set ambitious targets to transition rapidly away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and next-generation nuclear power. Climate activists are pushing for aggressive government interventions like carbon pricing, emissions caps, efficiency mandates, and investment in green infrastructure. Some in the environmental vanguard advocate even more extreme eco-austerity measures like degrowth, de-industrialization, and radically downsized consumption.  

Yet arrayed against this vision are the powerful nation-states and industries whose geopolitical power and economic muscle were built on hydrocarbon riches - the petro-powers who fear their global standing will be undermined if the world turns its back on oil, gas, and coal. From Vladimir Putin's revanchist Russia to Saudi Arabia's petromonarchy to the coal-fueled factories of China and India, much of the world remains steadfastly committed to the high-energy status quo out of entrenched strategic interests.  Even in the developed world, industries like agriculture, manufacturing, aviation, and shipping depend on affordable fossil fuels and lack viable low-carbon alternatives to sustain their current scales of production.

So we find ourselves in the opening battles of a 21st-century clash between ascendant climate hawks and entrenched industry powers, with the very future of advanced civilization hanging in the balance. The former fight to stave off ecological cataclysm in the name of environmental sustainability and human survival. The latter seek to uphold their familiar world order built on the bounties of carbon energy, fearing that aggressive decarbonization will immiserate billions still waiting for their shot at modern life.  

This is the great ideological and material struggle of our age, an epochal conflict that will shape geopolitics and power balances, enshrine social values and consumption norms, and determine the fate of humanity for generations to come. Will modern societies embrace radical transformation in energy, economics, and Promethean self-restraint to forestall climate catastrophe? Or will the great carbon powers pursue energy dominance and stay the juggernaut of hydro-carbon development, convinced that through innovation and adaptation they can circumvent Nature's wrath?

The outcome remains fiercely contested, but one side or the other must ultimately prevail. For on our watch, two profoundly opposed civilizational models are destined to clash in a climatic war that both sides view as existential, in which there can be no middle ground or victory short of total commitment.
