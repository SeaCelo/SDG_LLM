Here is a detailed newspaper article about SDG 13 (Climate Action), written from the perspective of Forbes magazine:

Climate Crisis Poses Existential Threat to Business - And The Global Economy 

By the Forbes Editorial Board

The impacts of climate change represent nothing less than an existential risk to businesses and the global economy. The anticipated shocks from rising temperatures, more extreme weather patterns, drought, flooding, forced migration and conflict over dwindling resources could prove cataclysmic if left unchecked. 

The cost of inaction is incalculable, with the potential for trillions in losses across all sectors and industries. Buildings, infrastructure, supply chains, agriculture, healthcare, insurance - everything touched by fossil fuel emissions stands to be severely compromised by the cascading consequences of climate change in the decades ahead.

And yet, despite decades of scientific warnings, greenhouse gas emissions from human activities continue rising to unprecedented levels year after year, exacerbating the global risk. We face a harrowing future where portions of the planet could eventually become uninhabitable if current trajectories persist.

Decisive action on an epic scale is required immediately to rapidly transition away from carbon-based fuels toward clean energy sources like wind, solar and next-gen nuclear. It's a herculean challenge that demands unprecedented cooperation between governments, the private sector, and the brightest innovators. Entrenched energy interests and political inertia have stymied progress for too long.

But the scientific reality can no longer be ignored - climate change is fundamentally reshaping risk profiles for businesses in ways never before contemplated. We are already witnessing its early upheavals. 

Just look at the physical devastation and economic disruption from recent wildfires, floods, storms and droughts around the world. Look at how the insurance industry is being rattled by soaring costs as once-rare disasters become commonplace. Look at how corporations are being forced to harden energy, water and supply systems against environmental shocks or risk catastrophic failures.

For most businesses, climate change wasn't even a factor until a few years ago. Now it's an all-encompassing risk management issue that requires nothing less than a fundamental rethinking of operations, supply chains, markets, products and business models.

Investors are taking notice, reshuffling capital away from industries and regions facing heightened climate exposure. The risks of stranded assets and devalued asset classes are mounting as the low-carbon transition gathers momentum. Companies that fail to adapt quickly are likely to be left behind, or worse yet, wiped out entirely if their vulnerabilities are not addressed.

From an opportunity perspective, innovations in renewable energy, batteries, green hydrogen, carbon capture, energy efficiency, resilient infrastructure, climate analytics and so many other areas hold immense potential for companies able to stake an early lead.

But make no mistake, the scale of creative destruction required to realign human civilization with a sustainable energy footprint is staggering. No sector will be untouched as entire industries are reinvented or culled outright. Business-as-usual is no longer an option in a world being dramatically reshaped by the physical realties of planetary change.

This tectonic shift underway portends nothing less than the next great economic reshuffling on par with the Industrial Revolution. The winners will be those organizations able to navigate the risks and capitalize on emerging opportunities in a carbon-constrained world. 

Those that fail to evolve with the same alacrity will be rendered obsolete by the pace of change required to meet the existential challenge climate change presents. The stakes couldn't be higher as the global community strives to ensure a flourishing future on an increasingly volatile planet.
