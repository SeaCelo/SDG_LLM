Climate change is the greatest existential threat humanity faces today. The stark reality of a warming planet, rising sea levels, and increasingly frequent and severe weather events has been laid bare in myriad scientific reports. Yet, the global response to this crisis has been woefully inadequate, marred by inaction, lack of political will, and a blatant disregard for the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities.

As a developing nation, India finds itself at the forefront of this battle, bearing the brunt of climate impacts while contributing a meager fraction of the world's cumulative emissions. Our nation's commitment to sustainable development and climate action is unwavering, but it must be guided by the core tenets of environmental justice and the right to development.

The Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global temperature rise to well below 2°C, preferably 1.5°C, is a laudable ambition, but it cannot be achieved through a one-size-fits-all approach. Developed nations, with their historical responsibility and greater financial and technological capabilities, must take the lead in emissions reductions and provide substantive support to developing countries.

India's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement are a testament to our nation's resolve. Our commitment to reducing the emissions intensity of our GDP by 33-35% from 2005 levels by 2030 and achieving 40% of our installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources by the same year is ambitious, especially considering our development imperatives.

However, we cannot ignore the fact that a significant portion of our population still lacks access to basic amenities like electricity, clean cooking fuel, and safe drinking water. Denying our people the right to development in the name of climate action would be a grave injustice. Instead, we must pursue a pathway that harmonizes economic growth, social progress, and environmental protection.

India's transition to a low-carbon economy must be facilitated by technology transfers, capacity building, and financial support from developed nations. The principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities, enshrined in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), must be upheld.

Our nation's efforts towards climate resilience and adaptation are equally crucial. From strengthening disaster management systems to promoting sustainable agriculture and water conservation practices, we must empower our communities to withstand the impacts of climate change.

Furthermore, India's leadership in the International Solar Alliance and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure underscores our commitment to global cooperation and knowledge-sharing in the fight against climate change.

As we navigate this complex challenge, we must remain steadfast in our pursuit of sustainable development, ensuring that no one is left behind. Climate action cannot be a zero-sum game; it must be a collective endeavor that upholds the principles of equity, justice, and shared responsibility.

Only through a paradigm shift in our approach, one that prioritizes the needs of the most vulnerable and respects the right to development, can we truly achieve the transformative change envisioned by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). India stands ready to lead this charge, but our efforts must be bolstered by a genuine global partnership that transcends rhetoric and delivers tangible results.
