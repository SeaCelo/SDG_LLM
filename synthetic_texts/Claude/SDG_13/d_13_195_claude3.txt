Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 13 (Climate Action) as if written by conservative columnist Cal Thomas:

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 13 calls for "urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts." As a conservative who values limited government, fiscal responsibility, and protecting individual liberty, I have serious reservations about the ideology underpinning this goal and the policies being proposed to achieve it.  

The primary assertion of the climate alarmists is that human emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide are causing catastrophic global warming that will lead to environmental disaster unless draconian steps are taken to curb those emissions worldwide. They insist the "science is settled" on this matter. However, the science is never truly settled, and many respected scientists remain skeptical about the degree of human influence and the reliability of climate modeling forecasting significant temperature increases. 

Even if one accepts the premise of human-caused climate change, the economic costs of transitioning away from abundant, affordable fossil fuel energy towards more diffuse and expensive renewable sources could be devastating, especially for developing nations seeking to lift their citizens out of poverty. Why should desperately poor people be denied access to cheap energy that was the catalyst for the West's industrial revolution and modern prosperity?

The activist prescription for climate action reveals the progressive hostility towards capitalism and free markets. The UN's recommendations include a massive expansion of government control over energy production and consumption, along with heavily punitive carbon taxes and regulations that would crush economic freedom and growth. This top-down, command-and-control approach is antithetical to the conservative principles of limited government, light taxation, and free enterprise.

We must also be wary of the implications for national sovereignty. Many policies to address climate change, such as international carbon pricing regimes or wealth redistribution programs, would require an unprecedented surrender of autonomy to unaccountable global bureaucracies in organizations like the UN. This is unacceptable to American constitutionalists who cherish self-government.

The climate change agenda emerging from bodies like the UN and being advanced by the political left represents an arrogant attempt to dictate how the world's economies should operate and how people should live their lives. It is rooted in an anti-human ideology that views mankind not as Earth's wise stewards but as a blighting presence whose prosperity and consumption must be radically constrained. 

This green austerity agenda would inflict particular harm on the United States by deliberately suppressing our vital fossil fuel industries, killing millions of good jobs and recklessly impairing our national security by increasing reliance on foreign energy sources. American energy dominance made possible by fracking and other innovations is one of the crowning economic achievements of the 21st century. It must be vigorously defended, not surrendered at the altar of climate alarmism.

While conservatives should always be good stewards of the environment, SDG 13 is a Trojan horse for an intrusive, coercive transnational agenda of energy austerity and eco-shackling of free markets that must be rejected. Sustainable development must mean sustained economic development through growth, prosperity, and freedom - not regression into eco-extremism.
