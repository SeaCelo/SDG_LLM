Here is a draft academic article on SDG 13 (Climate Action) as if written by satirist and columnist Heather Mallick:

The Road to Hell is Paved with Good Intentions: The Empty Rhetoric Behind SDG 13

Oh, the grand ambitions we harbour for saving the planet! If only our actions matched our lofty words. Sustainable Development Goal 13 calls for urgent measures to combat climate change and its impacts. But like so many desperately needed policies, it will likely accomplish little beyond making us feel virtuous.

The well-meaning bureaucrats at the UN have given us a Target 13.1 of strengthening resilience and adaptive capacity to climate hazards. I'm picturing a tiny Pacific island erecting defenses against rising seas using woven palm fronds and good luck charms. Target 13.2 wants us to integrate climate measures into national policies and planning. Yes, that will totally happen once the fossil fuel lobbyists are done eviscerating any meddlesome regulations.

Enlightening the public is Target 13.3's quixotic aim. Ordinary people may be convinced, but what of the oligarchs profiting from ecological destruction? They knew precisely what they were doing when they set forests ablaze and produced enough planet-warming emissions to ensure a hellish death cult future.

The most laughable target is 13.a's injunction to implement the $100 billion commitment to the Green Climate Fund. That's a pittance, mere p*ss in the wind when you consider the unfathomable costs of unchecked climate disaster. Still, even that inadequate sum hasn't materialized from wealthy nations like the US who put America First (into the scorching oven).

In the end, SDG 13 will join the scrapheap of noble ideas unless radical change occurs. Fat chance when the powers that be are making hay while the planet burns. Electric cars and wind turbines won't save us if we don't dismantle the system destroying the world for profit.

Decades of soaring rhetoric have changed nothing. The ruling class is fiddling as the world literally burns. When their luxury bunkers inevitably flood, I hope they choke on their artisanal oxygen supplies. Paradise lost should at least bring some sweet schadenfreude.
