The Saudi Fund for Development (SFD) recognizes the profound implications of climate change and the urgency to address this global challenge through concerted efforts aligned with Sustainable Development Goal 13 (SDG 13): Climate Action. As a leading development finance institution, the SFD is committed to integrating climate resilience and low-emission strategies into its operations and projects, catalyzing transformative change across the regions we serve.

In recent years, the SFD has witnessed firsthand the devastating impacts of climate change on vulnerable communities, ecosystems, and economies. From intensifying droughts and water scarcity to more frequent and severe natural disasters, the consequences of a warming planet threaten to undermine hard-won development gains and exacerbate existing socioeconomic disparities. Recognizing the interconnectedness of climate change and development challenges, the SFD has made climate action a strategic priority, aligning its efforts with the targets of SDG 13.

One of the SFD's key initiatives is the promotion of climate-resilient infrastructure and urban planning. Through projects like the Sustainable Cities Program in Sub-Saharan Africa, we are working with local governments and communities to design and implement climate-adaptive infrastructure solutions that can withstand the impacts of extreme weather events and rising sea levels. This includes investments in flood control systems, resilient transportation networks, and green urban spaces that not only mitigate climate risks but also enhance the overall livability and sustainability of cities.

Moreover, the SFD recognizes the critical importance of transitioning towards renewable energy sources and low-emission technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the long-term impacts of climate change. Our Green Energy Financing Facility, established in partnership with leading multilateral institutions, provides concessional financing and technical assistance to support the development of renewable energy projects in developing countries. By leveraging our financing and expertise, we aim to accelerate the deployment of clean energy solutions, such as solar, wind, and geothermal power, while fostering a just transition that creates economic opportunities and supports sustainable livelihoods.

Complementing our climate mitigation efforts, the SFD is also focused on enhancing adaptive capacity and resilience to climate-related hazards and natural disasters. Through initiatives like the Climate Resilience and Disaster Risk Management Program, we work closely with partner countries to strengthen early warning systems, enhance disaster preparedness, and build the capacity of local institutions and communities to respond effectively to climate-induced shocks. This includes investments in climate-smart agriculture, ecosystem-based adaptation measures, and community-driven resilience strategies that empower vulnerable populations to adapt to the changing climate.

Furthermore, the SFD recognizes the critical role of capacity building, knowledge sharing, and international cooperation in addressing the global challenge of climate change. Through our Climate Action Knowledge Hub, we facilitate the exchange of best practices, innovative solutions, and lessons learned among stakeholders, fostering cross-border collaboration and accelerating the dissemination of climate-friendly technologies and approaches. Additionally, we actively engage in global forums and initiatives, such as the Paris Agreement and the Green Climate Fund, advocating for ambitious climate action and mobilizing resources to support developing countries in their transition towards climate-resilient and low-emission pathways.

As we look ahead, the SFD remains steadfast in its commitment to SDG 13 and the global fight against climate change. We recognize that achieving this ambitious goal requires a multifaceted approach that addresses both mitigation and adaptation, while promoting sustainable development and inclusive economic growth. By leveraging our financial resources, technical expertise, and partnerships, we strive to catalyze transformative change, empowering communities, governments, and the private sector to build a more resilient and sustainable future for all.
