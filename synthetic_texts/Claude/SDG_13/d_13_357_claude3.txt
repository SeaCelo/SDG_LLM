The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) recognizes the critical importance of addressing climate change and its intrinsic link to sustainable development. As a multilateral development bank, we have a pivotal role in supporting our member countries in their efforts to combat the adverse impacts of global warming while promoting inclusive economic growth.

In the context of Sustainable Development Goal 13 (SDG 13), which aims to "take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts," the AIIB has adopted a comprehensive approach that integrates climate considerations into all aspects of our operations. Our strategy is centered on three key pillars: climate finance, climate-resilient infrastructure, and capacity building.

Climate Finance: The AIIB is committed to scaling up its investments in climate finance to support low-carbon and climate-resilient development pathways. We have established a dedicated Climate Change Investment Strategy, which targets a portfolio of projects contributing to greenhouse gas emissions reductions, climate resilience, and environmental sustainability. This strategy is underpinned by our ambitious goal of allocating at least 50% of our approved financing to climate finance by 2025.

To achieve this objective, we have developed innovative financial instruments, such as green bonds and climate-themed funds, which leverage private sector capital and catalyze investments in renewable energy, energy efficiency, sustainable transportation, and climate-smart urban development. Additionally, we prioritize co-financing arrangements with other multilateral development banks, climate funds, and bilateral partners to maximize the impact of our investments.

Climate-Resilient Infrastructure: Recognizing the vulnerability of infrastructure assets to climate-related risks, the AIIB places a strong emphasis on ensuring that our investments are climate-resilient. We have adopted a comprehensive Climate Risk Management Framework, which mandates the systematic assessment and integration of climate risk considerations across all stages of the project cycle, from project preparation to implementation and monitoring.

Our approach involves conducting rigorous climate risk and vulnerability assessments, incorporating climate-resilient design features, and implementing adaptive management strategies to enhance the resilience of infrastructure assets to climate-induced stresses, such as extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and temperature fluctuations. By prioritizing climate-resilient infrastructure, we aim to safeguard long-term investments, protect communities, and ensure the continuity of essential services in the face of a changing climate.

Capacity Building: The AIIB acknowledges that addressing climate change requires not only financial resources but also strong institutional capacities and technical expertise within our member countries. To this end, we have established a dedicated Climate Change Technical Assistance (TA) Facility, which provides grant funding and advisory services to support capacity building initiatives.

Through this facility, we collaborate with government agencies, research institutions, and civil society organizations to enhance climate change knowledge, strengthen policy and regulatory frameworks, and develop bankable climate projects. Our capacity building efforts span a wide range of sectors, including renewable energy, sustainable transportation, climate-smart agriculture, and climate change adaptation.

Furthermore, the AIIB recognizes the importance of fostering knowledge exchange and peer learning among our member countries. We facilitate regional and global dialogues, disseminate best practices, and promote South-South cooperation to accelerate the transfer of climate-friendly technologies and innovative solutions.

In conclusion, the AIIB's approach to SDG 13 is multifaceted, integrating climate considerations across our operations, mobilizing climate finance, promoting climate-resilient infrastructure, and building institutional capacities. By leveraging our unique position as a multilateral development bank, we aim to catalyze transformative change and accelerate the transition towards low-carbon and climate-resilient development pathways in Asia and beyond.
