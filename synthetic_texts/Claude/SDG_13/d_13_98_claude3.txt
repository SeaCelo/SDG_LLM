Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 13 (Climate Action) from the perspective of Tavleen Singh, the prominent Indian journalist and author:

The Gathering Storm: Why Climate Inaction Portends a Catastrophic Future

By Tavleen Singh

In my decades of reporting on the inflection points that have shaped the modern Indian republic, few issues loom as ominously as the existential crisis posed by climate change. The relentless assault of escalating temperatures, erratic monsoon patterns, and extreme weather events represents a mortal danger to the Indian civilization that has endured for millennia in the fertile Indus and Ganges river basins. Tragically, the lodestar of climate action - the 13th Sustainable Development Goal to "take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts" - remains a desperately unfulfilled imperative.

The empirical data is unequivocal in presenting a darkening portrait of our collective environmental peril: average temperatures across India rose by 0.7Â°C between 1901-2018, with increased heat waves projected to render vast swaths of the subcontinent uninhabitable in the latter half of this century; melting Himalayan glaciers threaten the flow of mighty rivers sustaining agriculture across the Indo-Gangetic plain; rising sea levels already batter the coasts and deltas from Gujarat to West Bengal, displacing millions; and rampant deforestation and pollution choke our cities and the very air we breathe. 

And yet, the inertia from our policy elites to enact transformative mitigation and adaptation plans remains as institutionalized as the antediluvian defeatism of the old colonial bureaucracy. For a nation that catalyzed the Non-Aligned Movement and punched above its weight in securing a fairer new world order, India's leadership in the climate domain has been distressingly wanting.

Where is the bold, decisive vision befitting the progeny of Jawaharlal Nehru, who thundered at the dawn of our independence about the "ambition to recreate the Indian universe"? Why does the feckless status quo from New Delhi persist, typified by piecemeal schemes that nibble around the periphery of this existential crisis rather than tackling it head-on? Empty pledges to enhanced renewable energy targets and greater climate financing ring hollow without an urgent, whole-of-society mobilization commensurate with the scale of this brewing calamity.

Perhaps the roots of this morbid complacency lie in the self-perception of India's ascendant elite as the harbingers of a revitalized great power - thus tempering their climate advocacy with a misplaced defensiveness about being hectored by Western hypocrisy on per capita emissions. Or maybe it emanates from the toxic nexus of cronyism and regulatory captured that has long plagued our environment ministries, polluted by corporate influence and babu inertia.

Whatever its wellsprings, the simple truth is that India cannot uphold its self-arrogated claim to be a 'Vishwaguru' while displaying such startling renunciation of environmental leadership. We jeopardize the sacred civilizational legacy that our ancestors safeguarded over the long Aryan summer by fruitlessly demanding more from wealthy nations that are only marginally more culpable than we for the climate chaos bearing down upon us all.

From my interviews with farmers in Rajasthan rendered destitute by harvest failures, to scenes of the annual deluge subsuming entire urban neighborhoods with each monsoon, to the haunting images of Delhi's children donning masks to counter hazardous air pollution - it is increasingly evident that India's greatest avoidable existential threat comes not from cantankerous neighbors or great power rivalries, but from the creeping climate Armageddon already unfolding in slow motion.

If we cherish our ancient Vedic covenant with this wondrous land nourished by a galaxy of rivers from the Indus to the Brahmaputra, then we must rediscover the spiritual and moral clarity that impelled our freedom struggle. Just as we expelled the pernicious ideology of colonial subjugators through the transformative defiance of satyagraha, so must we collectively unleash a new climate satyagraha to protect the ecological equilibrium that has sustained Indian civilization across the ages.

The choice before us is starkly binomial: continue the ruinous path of complacent denial about the looming climate apocalypse, succumbing to the lassitude and greed that laid low so many civilizations before us. Or rally from our reverie as a mighty civilization-state whose innovators pioneer the climate solutions to mitigate this crisis while showcasing to the world a holistic ecological model of sustainable development in harmony with the primordial rhythms of nature. To embrace the latter is not merely a pragmatic imperative - it is an intergenerational moral obligation to the 5000-year Indic renaissance that made ours the world's most resilient civilization.  

The rising storm of climate upheaval need not be our inevitable destiny. But surviving and prevailing against it demands a clarion call to action that commands the full might of Indian state capacity and social power. A new climate satyagraha to rekindle the fires of Indian dynamism, creativity, and insuperable will - that is the existential struggle of our times. On this alone may hinge whether ours shall remain a deathless civilization, or become another melancholic museum of fallen glory succumbing to the relentless entropy of history.
