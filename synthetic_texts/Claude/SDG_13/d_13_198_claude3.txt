Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 13 (Climate Action), written from the perspective of George Will:

The Fateful Folly of Ignoring Climate Change

By George Will

The phenomenon of climate change represents one of the paramount challenges confronting humanity in the 21st century. As an unabashed critic of unchecked federal power and environmental alarmism, I have been reticent to embrace the urgency propagated by many in the climate activist community. However, the preponderance of scientific evidence demands an objective reevaluation of the threats posed by unmitigated global warming.  

The hallmarks of conservative governance – promotion of economic prosperity, national security, and public welfare – are inextricably imperiled by cavalier inaction on climate change. The destabilizing impacts of escalating temperatures, rising sea levels, and intensifying extreme weather events undermine every pillar of an orderly, thriving society governed by rational respect for risk.

Fiscally, the projected costs of adapting to climate impacts and fortifying critical infrastructure from environmental disruptions represent generational burdens that are fiscally irresponsible to foist upon future generations. Estimates from the National Climate Assessment approximate trillions in losses to key sectors like agriculture, energy, labor productivity, and coastal property. A responsible conservative ethos centered on intergenerational equity compels proactive resilience against climate risks.

In matters of national defense, the Department of Defense identifies climate change as a "threat multiplier" catalyzing resource scarcities, mass displacements, and political instability – the preeminent breeders of armed conflict, terrorism, and geopolitical tension. Climate-induced humanitarian crises siphon military resources while destabilizing strategic regions; from the Middle East to the Arctic, climate change portends dire consequences for U.S. force projection.

Furthermore, divorcing market rationality from environmental stewardship emasculates the innovative potential of free enterprise. Pricing greenhouse gas emissions enables business ingenuity to flourish by properly internalizing climate impacts into the dynamics of supply and demand. Applying conservative principles of accountability and forward-thinking risk management catalyzes breakthrough technologies to reconcile sustainability and economic vitality.

The notion of preserving our environment has curiously become freighted with partisan rancor, as if prudent conservation of finite resources was somehow antithetical to conservative philosophy. President Reagan appointed judicious environmental stewards and negotiated the Montreal Protocol. My esteemed colleague in intellectual rigor, the British philosopher Sir Roger Scruton, advocated forcefully for conservative environmentalism rooted in pragmatism and aesthetic appreciation for nature's grandeur.

Fundamentally, climate change rejects ideological convenient fictions – measurable phenomena like atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, surface temperatures, sea levels, extremes of drought and precipitation are indifferent to partisan leanings. Willful disregard for empirics emasculates conservatism's claims to hardnosed rationality and abdicates the mantle of environmental custodianship espoused by the foundational conservationists.

The depth of my skepticism regarding the expansive ambitions of environmental activists is rivaled only by my discomfort at the cavalier diffidence exhibited in some conservative spheres regarding the climate crisis. Prudent risk analysis necessitates resolute climate action guided by the core conservative values of intergenerational responsibility, national security prioritization, market accountability, and empirical rationality. Pragmatic solutions reconciling economic dynamism and environmental sustainability beckon – if the political will can be mustered to heed conservatism's highest callings.
