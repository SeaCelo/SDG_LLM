Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 13 (Climate Action) as if written by Jonah Goldberg:

The Unsustainable Cult of Sustainable Development Goal 13

By Jonah Goldberg

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 13 calls for "urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts." On its face, this lofty rhetoric sounds unassailable. After all, who could be against sustainable development or combating environmental threats? As with so much transnational progressivism, the devil is in the mendacious details.

The core dogma underpinning SDG 13 is the hardline belief that human industrial activity, particularly in capitalist nations, is causing catastrophic and irreversible climate change that can only be mitigated through coordinated global government action. This was the same discredited hypothesis behind the overhyped acid rain and ozone depletion panics of the late 20th century.

The data doesn't back up the climate doomsdayers. Empirically, there has been no significant atmospheric warming in nearly two decades, falsifying the dishonest computer models peddled by ideological climatologists. The glaciers aren't melting, seas aren't rising dramatically, and extreme weather events haven't increased. The polar bear population is far from endangered.

Even if one concedes climate change is happening (the climate is always fluctuating), the solutions proposed by SDG 13 are ruinously expensive virtue signaling that will enrich crony capitalists and kleptocratic dictatorships without meaningfully impacting the climate. The 2015 Paris Agreement alone could cost $100 trillion over the next few decades, diverting crucial resources away from genuine threats like nuclear proliferation.

An underappreciated factor is the moral and economic stagnation bred by centralized economic planning schemes like those demanded under SDG 13. Such environmental policies inevitably involve dramatically expanding the regulatory state, smothering the market dynamism and technological innovation that have consistently uplifted living standards and environmental quality far more than bureaucratic diktats.

As the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau sagely warned, "freedom, being able to go wherever one pleases, cannot be enjoyed in its completeness except by getting sustenance directly from the earth." SDG 13 is premised on the conceit that freedom must be constrained by unelected experts for humanity's own good. This is the primrose path to serfdom.

Beyond economic privation, history has shown such top-down control inevitably metastasizes into nightmarish human rights abuses. The impoverished prison states of Cuba, Venezuela, and North Korea are among the prime agitators for SDG 13, cynically seeking to redistribute wealth from developed nations rather than improve environmental stewardship at home.

Behind the opaque rhetoric of "sustainability" and "resilience," SDG 13 is a Trojan horse for global corporatism, concentrating economic and political power into unaccountable institutions like the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and the World Bank. These unelected busybodies aim to override national sovereignty in service of a quasi-religious neo-pagan nature worship antithetical to the beliefs animating Western civilization.

Just as Galileo was persecuted for his heterodox scientific views, respected climatologists like Judith Curry and John Christy have been threatened, censored and ostracized for their data-driven skepticism of the climate catastrophists' claims. Intellectual freedom and rigorous empiricism are anathema to the Church of Sustainable Development.

Climate change is endlessly mutable, its "solutions" are conveniently open-ended, allowing this crusade to be infinitely expanded to satisfy the utopian longings of a credentialed class of dilettantes and busybodies. If the global economy is crippled by these costly remedies and climate fluctuations inevitably continue, the activists will demand more sacrifice and government control, not re-evaluation of unsubstantiated claims.

Genuine environmental challenges can and should be addressed through technological innovation, economic development, and protecting property rights – not centralized coercion by unelected bureaucrats. SDG 13 is quintessential environmentalist littering – virtue-signaling disposable rhetoric that makes greens feel good while choking the real pathway to human flourishing and ecological preservation. We should summarily reject this misanthropic, neo-Malthusian threat to freedom and prosperity.
