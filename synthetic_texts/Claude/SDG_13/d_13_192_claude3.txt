Here is a draft academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 13 (Climate Action) written from the perspective of economist Thomas Sowell:

The notion that mankind must take dramatic action to combat climate change has become an accepted truth among intellectual elites and policymakers worldwide. However, a dispassionate analysis suggests this environmentalist doctrine is being propagated with little regard for hard evidence or economic trade-offs.  

The very premise that human activity is causing catastrophic climate change remains far from proven. While the Earth has warmed modestly over the past century, Computer models used to make apocalyptic climate predictions have been repeatedly undermined by real-world data and the inherent shortcomings of trying to numerically simulate a vastly complex system like the Earth's atmosphere.  

Moreover, even taking the forecasts of climate alarmists at face value, the prescribed interventions demanded to be implemented on a global scale would carry staggering economic costs with a disparate impact on the world's poorest nations. The move toward carbon neutrality via forced renewable energy transitions and draconian restrictions on industrial activities would inflict tremendous harm on billions still struggling to attain basic living standards.  

Implicit in the rhetoric around "climate action" and SDG 13 is the assumption that the world's countries share incentives and capabilities to enforce environmental edicts orchestrated by unelected international bodies. Yet national and regional interests inescapably diverge. Developing economies understandably prioritize immediate needs like job creation, access to electricity and affordable food over hazy projections about hypothetical long-term environmental damage. Rapidly growing populations in Africa and Asia rightly view abundant, reliable energy - including from fossil fuels - as a necessity.

Even within the West, domestic politics vividly illuminate that citizens chafe at the personal costs and sacrifices demanded in the name of slashing carbon emissions. Championing such policies has proven an easy rhetorical platitude for transnational elites, but a far more difficult electoral sell as blunt realities emerge about skyrocketing energy prices and regressive impacts on livelihoods.

A historical perspective reminds that human resourcefulness and adaptability have consistently enabled economic and technological progress that uplifted societal welfare despite shifting environmental conditions. From the Bronze Age to the modern Industrial Era, innovation and market forces adjusting supply and demand provided sustainable solutions â€“ not bureaucratic mandates centrally planning the energy and resource mixes permissible for billions.  

The agenda of climate activism encapsulated in SDG 13 grossly overestimates the ability of top-down interventions by unaccountable global organizations to alter an issue as vast and complex as the Earth's climate. Instead, voluntary activities undertaken in individuals' rational self-interest in free societies have proven far more effective in generating sustained progress to elevate living standards worldwide. Sacrificing economic liberty and dynamic markets to pursue a coordinated global campaign of environmental virtue-signaling would only impoverish current and future generations. A more reasoned approach allowing adaptive courses of action is warranted.
