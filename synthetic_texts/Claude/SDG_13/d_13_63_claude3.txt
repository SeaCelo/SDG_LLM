Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 13 (Climate Action) as if written by Gwynne Dyer:

The Climate Crisis Endgame: Adaptation or Extinction?  

By Gwynne Dyer

The signs are everywhere, yet most of humanity remains oblivious. The planet's climate system, the sole source of environmental stability over the past 10,000 years that enabled human civilizations to emerge and flourish, is destabilizing at an unprecedented rate. We are bearing witness to its demise.

The impacts are no longer merely hypothetical scenarios. Devastating wildfires, crop failures, ocean acidification, biodiversity loss - these are the harbingers of the climate chaos unleashed by our staggering atmospheric pollution. If we fail to heed these omens and transform our relationship with the planet, the consequences could render vast swaths of the Earth uninhabitable within the lifetimes of today's children.

The existential stakes cannot be overstated. We are locked in an epic struggle between the Physics of carbon dioxide accumulation that traps more of the Sun's heat and the Politics of policy inertia dictated by corporate greed and public complacency. The science is clear: continuing on our current emissions trajectory equates to ecocide - the killing of our global ecological system.  

We face a binary civilizational choice: forced adaptation to a climate apocalypse, or an all-out war on emissions to avert it. The UN's "Sustainable Development Goal 13: Climate Action" demands mobilization as if for war against the existential threat. Yet the resources and policy commitments marshalled thus far remain woefully inadequate lip service, not remotely commensurate with the planetary emergency.

The science indicates carbon neutrality by 2050 is the absolute minimum if polar ice sheet disintegration, permafrost meltdown, and other irreversible tipping points are to be avoided. Yet under current policies, the planet is headed for over 3°C of warming by 2100 - a death sentence for human civilization as we know it. Catastrophic climate destabilization may have already become inevitable.

The elite policy consensus delusionally hopes that gradually phasing out emissions while relying on carbon capture technologies to remove excess CO2 from the atmosphere can solve the crisis. A reckless gamble at best. Carbon removal at the required planetary scale is economically and technologically implausible for decades. Meanwhile, the process of baking sufficient emissions into the atmosphere to cook the planet is well underway.

Bitter truth must be faced: keeping within the 1.5°C warming limit necessitates not just a managed transition from fossil fuels to clean energy, but a planned, emergency economic Triage - selectively demolishing and decommissioning entire industries and infrastructure optimized for CO2 production. Anything less than a climate revolution overthrowing the status quo constitutes surrender to a dying planet.

Aviation, shipping, steel-making, cement production, meat and dairy agribusiness - these sectors should all be immediately targeted for rapid, near-term contraction or shutdown rather than gradual decarbonization. Combined, they account for over a third of global emissions and are largely technologically unabatable due to a lack of viable zero-carbon substitutes.

There are no bystanders in the war for climate survival. Every fossil fuel industry, corporation, bank, government and individual fuelling future warming is an active combatant against a living planet. The conflict transcends conventional politics - no group immune from the casualties as climate chaos escalates. 

Through emissions, we have become geological forces stripping the Earth's life support capacity. Though our footprint is planetary, our vision and planning remain parochially local. Those expecting to preserve stable regional pockets of climate normalcy within an unravelling global system will inevitably succumb to the cascading biosystem breakdowns that lie ahead.

For all but the youngest, an inhabitable Earth has become the impossible dream. As climate impacts accelerate, there will be no bolthole awaiting the wealthy fleeing their gated communities while the global poor bear the brunt. When agricultural systems start failing on a large scale, conflicts over water, food and habitable zones will explode globally.

Our carbon-burning over two centuries has disrupted the climate equilibrium underpinning human development. Barring a miracle of global cooperation and technological innovation, we have tragically overshot the planet's capacity for sustainable life as we have known it. Adaptation is now the only survival option.

The cruel injustice is that those least responsible for causing the climate crisis face exposure to its worst effects. In Africa alone, over 100 million people may be displaced by desertification, rising sea levels and famine-inducing droughts this century. Mass climate migration, border conflicts, collapsed states and Hobbesian societal collapse loom on a planetary scale.

As climate destabilization compounds other systemic risks - disease pandemics, nuclear proliferation, AI existential risk - we will confront the most challenging and protracted period of adaptation in human experience. The questions we must wrestle with are no longer about how to tackle climate change, but how many nuclear families we can realistically sustain at equilibrium within the depleted biosphere.

The searing climate crisis may ultimately birth a unified global civilization overcoming divisions of nation, race and creed. But the unfathomable cost of species-level learning required to get there may first reduce our numbers to those from which we began our civilizational ascent.

Through remarkable innovation and collective sacrifice, a remnant of humanity may biologically and technologically adapt to the climate anarchies unleashed - cultivating refugia under geoengineered atmospheric shielding, migrating between hospitable zones tracking the seasons, maintaining isolated biodiversity arks as seeds for future recovery.

But for most of the species arrogantly dubbing itself Homo sapiens, its time as a geological force on this planet will be nasty, brutish, and short. A cautionary tale to be studied in awed silence by whatever hardy life emerges from the coming climate disruptions eons hence. Adapt or go extinct: the binary legacy we are choosing for our planetary descendants.
