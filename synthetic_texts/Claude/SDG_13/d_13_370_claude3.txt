The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's latest report paints a dire picture of the impacts of climate change on the world of work. Rising temperatures, sea level rise, and extreme weather events threaten to disrupt labor markets, exacerbate existing vulnerabilities, and perpetuate cycles of poverty and inequality. As we strive to achieve the targets outlined in Sustainable Development Goal 13 (SDG 13) – Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts – the International Labour Organization (ILO) recognizes the imperative to prioritize climate action within the realm of labor and employment.

The agriculture sector, which employs over a billion workers globally, is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Prolonged droughts, erratic rainfall patterns, and soil degradation are already hampering productivity and threatening the livelihoods of smallholder farmers and agricultural workers, many of whom reside in developing nations. Climate-induced crop failures and livestock losses have far-reaching implications, from food insecurity to forced migration and deepening poverty cycles.

Furthermore, the transition towards a low-carbon economy, while necessary to mitigate the worst effects of climate change, poses significant challenges for workers in carbon-intensive industries such as fossil fuel extraction, energy production, and manufacturing. Without proactive measures to facilitate just transitions, mass job losses and economic dislocation could exacerbate social unrest and compound existing inequalities.

Recognizing the inextricable link between climate action and decent work, the ILO has been at the forefront of promoting green jobs and sustainable economic development. Through the Green Jobs Initiative, the organization has collaborated with governments, employers, and workers to foster enabling environments for the creation of green jobs, particularly in renewable energy, sustainable construction, and eco-tourism.

However, achieving a just transition requires more than job creation; it necessitates comprehensive policies and programs that address the multifaceted challenges faced by workers and communities affected by climate change and the transition to a green economy. The ILO's Guidelines for a just transition towards environmentally sustainable economies and societies for all provide a framework for governments and social partners to anticipate and mitigate the impacts of climate change and environmental degradation on employment.

Central to this framework is the promotion of social dialogue and tripartite cooperation between governments, employers, and workers' organizations. By fostering inclusive decision-making processes, stakeholders can collectively identify vulnerabilities, develop adaptation strategies, and implement targeted interventions to protect workers' rights and livelihoods.

For instance, in the Pacific Island nation of Kiribati, where rising sea levels threaten to submerge large swaths of land, the ILO has facilitated social dialogue to develop a national policy on labor migration. This policy aims to equip workers with the skills and support needed to seek employment opportunities abroad, mitigating the economic impacts of climate-induced displacement.

Capacity building and skills development are crucial components of the ILO's efforts to promote climate resilience and facilitate the transition to green economies. Through initiatives such as the Green Jobs Programme and the Partnerships for Skills for Green Jobs, the organization has supported the development of technical and vocational education and training programs tailored to the needs of sustainable industries.

In the Philippines, for example, the ILO has collaborated with the government and industry partners to establish a training program for workers in the renewable energy sector, equipping them with the skills needed to install and maintain solar photovoltaic systems. Such programs not only enhance employability but also contribute to the broader goal of advancing sustainable energy solutions.

Recognizing the disproportionate impact of climate change on marginalized and vulnerable groups, the ILO has advocated for targeted interventions to promote gender equality and social inclusion in the context of climate action. Women, who comprise a significant portion of the agricultural workforce in many developing countries, are often disproportionately affected by climate-related disasters and economic disruptions.

Through the ILO's Promoting Decent Work in the Management of Exit from the Marginalized Migrant Situations project, the organization has supported initiatives to enhance the resilience of female agricultural workers in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar. These efforts include providing access to climate-resilient technologies, promoting sustainable agricultural practices, and facilitating access to social protection and financial services.

As the global community grapples with the escalating challenges posed by climate change, the ILO's role in catalyzing action towards SDG 13 becomes increasingly pivotal. By fostering social dialogue, promoting green jobs and skills development, and advocating for just transitions, the organization is well-positioned to mitigate the impacts of climate change on the world of work and contribute to the broader pursuit of sustainable development.

However, achieving the ambitious targets of SDG 13 will require concerted efforts from all stakeholders, including governments, employers, workers' organizations, and civil society. Only through collective action, international cooperation, and a steadfast commitment to environmental stewardship can we safeguard the livelihoods of workers, ensure decent work opportunities, and build resilient societies capable of withstanding the escalating challenges of climate change.
