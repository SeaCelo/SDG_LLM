The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) recognizes the critical importance of addressing climate change and its inextricable link to sustainable development. SDG 13, "Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts," serves as a guiding framework for our efforts to catalyze private investment and mitigate climate-related risks.

Our analysis begins with a stark reality – the world is already experiencing the devastating consequences of a changing climate. Rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and biodiversity loss are just a few of the challenges that threaten to undermine decades of progress in poverty reduction and economic growth. Without decisive action, these impacts will only intensify, disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable populations and exacerbating existing inequalities.

To address this existential threat, MIGA is committed to leveraging the power of the private sector through innovative risk mitigation instruments and strategic partnerships. Our political risk insurance products provide critical risk coverage, enabling investors to confidently pursue climate-friendly projects in emerging markets. This support is particularly crucial in regions where the need for climate adaptation and mitigation measures is most acute.

MIGA's efforts are guided by a multifaceted approach that aligns with the targets set forth under SDG 13. First, we prioritize investments in renewable energy projects, such as solar, wind, and geothermal power generation. By reducing reliance on fossil fuels and promoting clean energy solutions, these investments directly contribute to the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions – a key target under SDG 13.

Furthermore, MIGA recognizes the importance of climate-resilient infrastructure in safeguarding communities and economies against the impacts of climate change. Our support for projects in areas like water management, sustainable agriculture, and climate-smart urban development directly addresses the adaptation needs outlined in SDG 13. For instance, our recent involvement in a desalination plant in Morocco not only addresses water scarcity concerns but also contributes to climate resilience by providing a reliable water source in the face of droughts and changing precipitation patterns.

Complementing our project-level support, MIGA actively collaborates with stakeholders across the public and private sectors to promote knowledge sharing, capacity building, and policy alignment. Our partnership with the Climate Investment Funds (CIFs) is a prime example, where we leverage our risk mitigation tools to unlock private capital for transformative climate projects in developing countries.

Moreover, MIGA's engagement extends beyond project finance to encompass advisory services and technical assistance. We work closely with governments, investors, and project sponsors to enhance their understanding of climate risks and facilitate the integration of climate considerations into investment decision-making processes. This holistic approach ensures that our support is not only financially impactful but also contributes to building long-term resilience and fostering a culture of climate-conscious investment.

As a multilateral agency, MIGA recognizes the critical importance of international cooperation and collective action in addressing the global challenge of climate change. We actively participate in global forums and initiatives, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement, to contribute our expertise and align our efforts with international goals and commitments.

Looking ahead, MIGA remains steadfast in our commitment to supporting climate action through private sector engagement. We continuously explore innovative financial solutions and strategic partnerships to mobilize capital for climate-friendly investments, particularly in emerging markets where the need for sustainable development is most pressing.
