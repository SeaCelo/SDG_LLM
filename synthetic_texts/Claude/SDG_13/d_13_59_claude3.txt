Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 13 (Climate Action) as if written by Judith Sloan, an economist known for her critiques of climate change mitigation policies:

The 13th Sustainable Development Goal - "Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts" - is a contentious and misguided endeavor that has been elevated to an ideological crusade. While well-intentioned, the policies proposed to achieve this goal are economically destructive, scientifically questionable, and ultimately an exercise in virtue signaling rather than substantive reform.

The fundamental flaw lies in the flimsy evidentiary basis invoked to justify draconian climate policies and regulatory overreach. Despite a barrage of apocalyptic rhetoric from climate alarmists, the scientific reality is far more nuanced. Temperature datasets show modest warming over the past century, potentially influenced by multidecadal oceanic oscillations and solar activity as much as anthropogenic factors. Climate models, upon which grandiose mitigation schemes are predicated, have consistently overestimated warming trends and failed to accurately project variables like Arctic sea ice extent.

More crucially, the purported risks of climate change have been grotesquely exaggerated, fueling irrational fear rather than measured risk assessment. Extreme weather events like hurricanes, droughts, and floods show no systematic increase in frequency or intensity over modern observational periods. Rising sea levels, while ongoing, are decelerating rather than accelerating, posing manageable adaptation challenges rather than imminent calamity. The parade of predicted catastrophes, from submerged islands to millions of climate refugees, never eventuates, undermining the credibility of climate catastrophism.

Yet in the face of such dubious evidence, the international community remains transfixed by the climate change dogma, instituting economically damaging policies with limited effective impact. The Paris Agreement, exemplifying this futile crusade, imposes draconian emissions reductions targets devoid of cost-benefit justification or global enforcement mechanisms. Nations like Australia, pressured to pursue exorbitantly expensive renewable energy schemes, face crippling costs while exporters like China ramp up emissions unabated. This unilateral economic self-harm is the quintessence of policy incoherence.

Perhaps more pernicious are the moral blinkers donned by climate activists, paradoxically advocating for policies that disproportionately immiserate the global poor. Imposed carbon constraints and hindrances to affordable energy access perpetuate poverty, diminish economic opportunity, and cost lives through deprivation of basic necessities. The singular-minded climate change fixation neglects more tractable development issues like clean water, sanitation, nutrition, and disease prevention - interventions proven to enhance human wellbeing and resilience.

Fundamentally, the SDG 13 agenda represents an overreaching climate theology masquerading as environmental pragmatism. Its sanctimonious crusaders weaponize climate change as a pretext for centralizing economic control, impeding growth, shackling the free market, and empowering unelected internationalist bureaucracies - all while championing regressive policies that enshrine energy poverty. Rational discourse on climate risks and measured adaptation should supersede this ideological zeal.

Rather than capitulating to the climate dogmatists, policymakers must reassert economic and scientific rationality. Invest in resilient infrastructure, remove counterproductive energy subsidies, embrace market-based innovations and technological development that reduce emissions alongside poverty. Above all, resist the siren song of climate catastrophism, utopian gestures, and the suffocating groupthink strangling substantive debate. An unsentimental, hard-nosed reappraisal is imperative to extricate society from this climate quagmire.
