Here's a detailed newspaper article about SDG 14 (Life Below Water) as if written for the provocative and sensationalist New York Post:

OCEANS IN CRISIS: WILL WE SWIM OR SINK?

It's a perfect summer day at the Jersey Shore, but the picturesque scene is hiding a dirty secret. Beneath those glistening waves lurks a horror show — and it's happening right under our noses! 

From plastic waste choking marine life to overfishing decimating fish stocks, our oceans are facing an unprecedented onslaught. And if we don't act soon, it could spell disaster for coastal communities like ours that rely on these waters for food, jobs and billion-dollar tourism revenues.

"The situation is Code Red," warns renowned marine biologist Dr. Sylvia Earle. "We're destroying the oceans at a rate never witnessed in human history." 

The statistics are apocalyptic: Up to 12 million metric tons of plastic pour into the ocean every year — enough to cover every foot of coastline on Earth. Garbage patches like the Great Pacific Gyre are now bigger than whole states, trapping and killing whales, turtles and countless other creatures.

As if that wasn't bad enough, 90% of the world's fisheries are now fully exploited or overfished thanks to industrial-scale operations and shady illegal tactics. In our own backyard, iconic species like Atlantic cod have plummeted over 90% due to overfishing near the Gulf of Maine.

Climate change is supercharging the crisis, causing ocean warming, acidification and depleted oxygen levels that could wipe out marine ecosystems and fuel more extreme weather events. Scientists warn rising sea levels will displace over a quarter billion people by 2100 if we don't get emissions under control.

You'd think world leaders would be doing something about this unfolding Armageddon, right? Wrong! Despite adopting the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 14 to "conserve and sustainably use the oceans", humanity is failing miserably at its lofty promises.

Just look at the scorecard: We're nowhere near hitting the 2020 target to ban harmful fisheries subsidies that enable overfishing. Only around 8% of coastal waters are protected, far below the goal of 10% by 2020. And the volume of plastic waste keeps growing exponentially every year as corporations pump out more single-use crap.

"We're taking the oceans for granted with catastrophic consequences," laments veteran oceanographer Dr. David Gallo. "At this rate, there may be more plastic than fish in the sea by 2050."

This sickening tragedy hammers home just how critical marine conservation is to human survival. The oceans produce over half the world's oxygen and absorbed around 30% of the carbon dioxide emissions driving global warming over the last few decades.

"When the oceans get sick, we get sick," notes Dr. Earle. "Their demise means the demise of humanity itself."

So what's the solution? For starters, we need to take the "global goals" we keep spouting seriously and go all-in on legally binding international policies and funding to protect marine environments. You can bet your beach houses that I won't hold my breath given the track record.

At home, it's time for radical action to tackle the scourge of plastic pollution by banning single-use items, boosting recycling massively and switching to sustainable alternatives. Individuals can also help by cutting out plastics, supporting coastal cleanups and favoring sustainably sourced seafood.

Bottom line: Our oceans won't just heal themselves. If we want to avoid total calamity and leave a thriving 'blue planet' for future generations, we must start treating our marine environments with the profound respect they deserve — before it's too late.

Act now, or we're all going to be sleeping with the fishes permanently.
