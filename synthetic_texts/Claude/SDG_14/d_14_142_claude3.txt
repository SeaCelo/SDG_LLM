The Forgotten World Below: Why We Must Protect Our Oceans

By Mike Barnicle

When you think about the great environmental crises of our time, what comes to mind? Climate change, deforestation, plastic pollution perhaps? While all are daunting challenges, there is one area that often gets overlooked - the degradation of our oceans and marine resources. The seas have long been humanity's overlooked commonpool resource, perpetually abused and taken for granted. 

We treat the oceans as a limitless waste receptacle, dumping millions of tons of garbage, plastic, industrial pollutants and toxic runoff into their depths each year. Overfishing of critical species has pushed marine ecosystems to the brink. Warming waters and acidification from carbon emissions are killing life-sustaining coral reefs at a staggering pace.

It's a vicious cycle of exploitation and destruction that I've seen firsthand from my years reporting on coastal communities from New England to the Gulf of Mexico. I'll never forget visiting a shoreline in Mississippi after the BP oil spill and seeing the devastation - miles of once-pristine white sand beaches soaked in thick black crude, the stench of petroleum hanging heavy in the air. The impacts on local fisheries and marine habitats were catastrophic and still haven't fully recovered over a decade later.

The human consequences are often forgotten in these environmental disasters. So many poor coastal populations around the world depend on marine resources for their food, livelihoods and very way of life that has sustained them for generations. When we allow overfishing, pollution and unabated climate change to destroy the oceans' bounty, it is those most vulnerable communities who suffer first and worst. 

Thankfully, there are constructive efforts underway through the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 14 to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources. But meeting those targets over the next decade requires dramatic action on a global scale.

We have to get serious about protecting at least 10% of coastal and marine areas through conservation, while restoring and increasing the resilience of endangered marine ecosystems like coral reefs. Ending the scourge of overfishing through improved regulation and enforcement is paramount, as is substantially reducing all sources of marine pollution.

Perhaps most critically, we have to solve the underlying drivers like carbon emissions and climate change that are so rapidly warming and acidifying the oceans. Without addressing root causes, all other sustainability efforts for marine environments are diminished.

None of this will be easy. There are powerful commercial fishing interests opposed to more regulation. The fossil fuel behemoths will fight climate policies tooth and nail. And the sheer global scale of cleaning up the oceans from decades of wanton pollution is incredibly daunting. It will take an unprecedented marshaling of political will, resources and global cooperation.

But we must remember that the oceans are not merely an environment to be protected for its own sake. They are the circulatory system of this planet, producing half of the world's oxygen and absorbing huge volumes of carbon dioxide. Marine fisheries are a critical food source for billions. Coastal ecosystems like mangroves and wetlands provide a first line of defense against worsening storms, floods and sea level rise.

In other words, the health of the oceans underpins all life on Earth. We ignore their deterioration at our own peril. It's time we paid attention to the forgotten world below before it's too late.
