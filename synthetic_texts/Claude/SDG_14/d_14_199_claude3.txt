Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 14 (Life Below Water) as if written by the late economist Walter E. Williams:

The Unseen Costs of Exploiting the Oceans
By Walter E. Williams

In contemplating the 14th Sustainable Development Goal of the United Nations—"Life Below Water"—we would be wise to employ economic thinking and consider both the seen and unseen consequences of human action upon the world's oceans, seas, and marine resources. At the core of economic analysis is the study of incentives, tradeoffs, and opportunity costs. While the perceived benefits of exploiting ocean resources are visible, the often dispersed costs borne by third parties and future generations remain obscured from view.

The overexploitation of the oceans through overfishing, pollution, habitat destruction, and other unsustainable practices serves as a quintessential example of the Tragedy of the Commons. When resource users face private costs while reaping private rewards, the incentive to overexploit the open-access commons is ever-present. Nations and corporations deplete fisheries beyond replenishable yields to increase short-term profits, secure protein sources, and promote economic growth. The long-term productivity loss resulting from decimated fish stocks is an unseen, dispersed cost borne by future generations and the entire world.

While international policies and agreements attempt to curb overexploitation, the open-access nature of the oceans and lack of well-defined property rights render regulation ineffective and rife with free-rider problems. Poaching remains widespread, quotas based on dubious population estimates are ineffective, marine reserves merely relocate fishing pressures, and illegal fishing vessels operate with impunity on the high seas. Massive government subsidies, amounting to $35 billion annually, exacerbate the overcapitalization and overcapacity plaguing the global fishing industry.  

The dumping of plastics, chemicals, nutrient pollution, and other wastes into the world's waters presents another insidious scenario of concentrated benefits and diffused, unaccounted costs. Corporations reduce their disposal expenditures while fouling international waters and coastlines worldwide. Some pollutants bio-accumulate across the marine food chain, eventually sickening human consumers of seafood products. Clean-up and remediation costs are externalized upon coastal communities, taxpayers, future generations, and anyone unlucky enough to suffer the medical consequences.  

Economic thinking further elucidates the tradeoffs and opportunity costs of activities that degrade marine ecosystems. Destructive practices like bottom trawling, dynamite fishing, and coastal development imperil critical spawning and nursery habitats that sustain the health and abundance of marine species. These ecosystem services underpin the ocean's biological productivity and resilience. Compromising them today may yield modest commercial gains while engendering an unseen cost—the permanent erosion of the oceans' capacity to generate future economic output, nutritional resources, recreational opportunities, climate stability, and innumerable other benefits to society.

In addressing the 14th Sustainable Development Goal, we would be wise to implement economic approaches that align incentives with judicious, far-sighted stewardship. Market-based mechanisms for internalizing externalities—whether through cap-and-trade systems, pollution taxes, or property rights regimes like Territorial Use Rights for Fisheries—offer much promise but require rigorous monitoring and enforcement mechanisms on the high seas.

Ultimately, the unseen costs of ocean degradation compound over time, and the burden falls disproportionately upon future generations who will inherit a compromised, less bountiful marine environment. Failing to accurately diagnose and mitigate these ominous economic realities makes a mockery of any notion of truly "sustainable" ocean development. Only a rigorous economic analysis, devoid of specious moral preening or misplaced faith in centralized global governance, can chart a judicious, incentive-aligned course towards conserving the oceans for posterity.
