Here goes, an academic article about SDG 14 (Life Below Water) from the perspective of satirist Mark Steel:

The Old Man and the Unsustainable Sea

Well they've done it again, those big-headed bureaucrats at the United Nations. Not content with forcing every schoolchild to memorize the 193 member states in the general assembly,  they've now gifted us the Sustainable Development Goals. All 17 of the blighters.  Because as we all know, nothing screams "sustainable development" quite like a few dozen jargon-stuffed, painfully broad policy statements. 

But being the fearless academic I am, I decided to grapple with one of these lofty goals. Specifically the one about ocean conservation - SDG 14: "Life Below Water". It sounds harmless enough. Though of course if we're taking things literally, it could just as easily refer to aquatic cryptids like the Loch Ness Monster or that old man from the Hemingway novel constantly banging on about fish. 

Alas, after squinting at the UN's goals and targets for approximately 7 seconds, I quickly realized this was about preserving marine ecosystems and resources. Hippy tree-hugger stuff basically. Though as someone who had an extremely unpleasant experience with a Portuguese man-of-war circa 1987, I can't say I'm inclined to empathize greatly with our oceangoing friends.

That said, I did think it was rather sporting of the UN to dedicate an entire global agenda to halting the relentless destruction and pollution of the seas by commercial fishing operations, Big Oil, and ocean-going thrill seekers with a penchant for semi-automatically discarding their empty beer cans. But surely there's more to it than that?

As it turns out, yes, there are a full 10 targets associated with SDG 14, each more baffling than the last. For example, did you know that by 2020 we were meant to have "sustainably managed and protected marine and coastal ecosystems" in order to "avoid significant adverse impacts"? I'll let you ponder that one for a moment.

Then we have targets like "minimizing and addressing the impacts of ocean acidification" - a rather quixotic objective when you consider that the leading cause of acidification is rising CO2 levels. It's a bit like resolving to treat a shotgun blast wound by banning rocksalt ammunition. 

But by far my favorite has to be Target 14.6 - the one urging us to "prohibit certain forms of fisheries subsidies which contribute to overcapacity and overfishing" by 2020. Yes, you read that correctly. The great boffins of the UN actually believed the world's nations could collaborate to eliminate environmentally-damaging fishing subsidies within 6 short years. I don't know about you, but I'll be awaiting that landmark achievement with bated breath!

Look, I understand the need for international cooperation, sustainable ecosystems, blah blah blah. But at a certain point we have to be realistic. Realistically, SDG 14's goals and targets sound less like a pragmatic action plan and more like the wild-eyed fantasies of a coastal eco-warrior browning out in a wave-battered VW camper van.

We all want to preserve the world's precious marine environments. But is a bloated, unenforceable UN policy document really the solution? Or is it simpler to just pass the buck to our planetary overlords, the dolphins? I suspect if we let those sagacious sea mammals take the reins, SDG 14's targets might already be a reality. 

Either that or we're all going to drown in a neo-Atlantis of our own making, the once-fertile oceans turned to arid, acidic killing fields by the relentless tide of human greed and ecological shortsightedness. But hey, at least we'll go out with a few fancy development goals under our belt - silverlinings and all that!
