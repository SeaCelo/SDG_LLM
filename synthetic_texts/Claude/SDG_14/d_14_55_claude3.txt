The Sustainable Development Goal of "Life Below Water" (SDG 14) has admirable intentions of conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas, and marine resources. However, a sober cost-benefit analysis reveals that many of the proposed targets and interventions under this goal are an inefficient use of limited resources and fail to deliver the promised environmental benefits.

One glaring issue is the focus on reducing marine pollution, particularly from land-based activities, including nutrient pollution (Target 14.1). While it's true that nutrient runoff can lead to harmful algal blooms and dead zones, the economic costs of curbing this pollution are staggeringly high compared to the benefits. My think tank, Copenhagen Consensus, has estimated that achieving this target through improved wastewater treatment and better fertilizer management would cost over $1 trillion annually. Yet, the benefits in terms of increased fishery yields and tourism revenues are dwarfed by these costs, amounting to just a fraction of the investment required.

Moreover, the call to effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing (Target 14.4) is easier said than done. Attempts to establish sustainable fisheries through catch limits and marine protected areas have often failed due to poor enforcement, lack of data, and the complexities of managing migratory fish stocks across national boundaries. The costs of monitoring and policing vast ocean territories are prohibitive, and the economic losses from reduced fishing yields can be devastating for coastal communities reliant on this industry.

The goal's emphasis on increasing the economic benefits from sustainable use of marine resources (Target 14.7) is also questionable. While marine biotechnology and eco-tourism hold promise, their potential is often overstated, and the benefits are likely to accrue primarily to developed nations with the necessary technological and infrastructural capabilities. For many developing coastal nations, sacrificing traditional fishing practices for uncertain economic opportunities could exacerbate poverty and food insecurity.

Instead of pursuing these costly and ineffective interventions, we should focus our limited resources on more promising solutions that deliver tangible and cost-effective benefits. For instance, investing in research and development to improve aquaculture practices could help meet the growing global demand for seafood while reducing pressure on wild fisheries. Similarly, targeted efforts to reduce plastic pollution in ocean gyres and coastal regions can yield substantial environmental and economic benefits by protecting marine ecosystems and preserving tourism revenue.

Ultimately, the Sustainable Development Goal of "Life Below Water" suffers from a lack of prioritization and a failure to rigorously evaluate the costs and benefits of its proposed targets. While protecting our oceans is undoubtedly important, we must be pragmatic and channel our resources towards interventions that deliver the greatest bang for the buck. Blindly pursuing all targets under this goal, without considering their true environmental and economic impacts, could do more harm than good.
