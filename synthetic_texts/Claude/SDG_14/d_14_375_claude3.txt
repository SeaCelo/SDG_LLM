The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) recognizes the pivotal role of Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG 14), "Life Below Water," in safeguarding the planet's marine ecosystems and promoting sustainable economic growth. As an organization dedicated to facilitating cross-border investments and fostering sustainable development, MIGA is committed to supporting projects that align with SDG 14's objectives.

The world's oceans and marine resources are under immense pressure from a multitude of threats, including overfishing, pollution, habitat destruction, and the impacts of climate change. These challenges not only endanger the delicate balance of marine ecosystems but also jeopardize the livelihoods and food security of coastal communities, particularly in developing nations. Addressing these issues is crucial for achieving sustainable development and ensuring the long-term viability of marine resources.

MIGA recognizes the need for a comprehensive and coordinated approach to tackling the challenges posed by SDG 14. This involves fostering international cooperation, strengthening legal and regulatory frameworks, and promoting sustainable practices across various sectors, including fisheries, tourism, and maritime transportation.

One of MIGA's key priorities is to support investments that contribute to the sustainable management and protection of marine and coastal ecosystems. This includes projects that aim to reduce marine pollution, restore degraded habitats, and promote sustainable fishing practices. By providing political risk insurance and credit enhancement products, MIGA can catalyze private sector investment in these areas, encouraging responsible stewardship of marine resources.

Furthermore, MIGA plays a crucial role in promoting the development of sustainable coastal infrastructure and tourism. By supporting investments in eco-friendly coastal development projects, MIGA can help mitigate the environmental impacts of tourism while fostering economic growth and job creation in local communities. This approach aligns with SDG 14's targets of increasing the economic benefits from sustainable use of marine resources for Small Island Developing States and Least Developed Countries.

In addition to its investment support activities, MIGA actively collaborates with international organizations, governments, and civil society to advance SDG 14's objectives. This includes supporting research and knowledge-sharing initiatives, promoting capacity-building efforts, and advocating for stronger policies and regulations to protect marine ecosystems.

One notable example of MIGA's commitment to SDG 14 is its involvement in the Blue Economy Initiative, a collaborative effort between various multilateral development banks to promote sustainable and inclusive economic growth in the marine and coastal sectors. Through this initiative, MIGA is actively supporting projects that contribute to the conservation and sustainable use of marine resources, while also generating socioeconomic benefits for local communities.

In conclusion, as a multilateral investment guarantee agency, MIGA plays a vital role in advancing the objectives of SDG 14 by catalyzing private sector investment in sustainable marine and coastal projects. Through its suite of risk mitigation products and strategic partnerships, MIGA is actively supporting the development of a blue economy that balances economic growth with environmental sustainability. By fostering international cooperation, promoting sustainable practices, and facilitating investments in marine conservation and coastal development, MIGA is contributing to the preservation of our oceans and marine resources for future generations.
