Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 14 (Life Below Water), written from the perspective of economist Joshua D. Angrist:

The quest to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources is embodied in the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 14 - Life Below Water. This imperative has taken on heightened urgency as the world's oceans face unprecedented threats from anthropogenic forces like pollution, overfishing and climate change. As an empirical economist, my aim is to assess the causal impacts of various policies and interventions aimed at achieving SDG 14 through the lens of natural experiments and rigorous program evaluation.

A major focus has been on combating illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, which accounts for an estimated 20% of the global catch and gravely undermines sustainable fisheries management. Using satellite data on observed fishing activity as a proxy for catch, we employed a regression discontinuity design that leveraged the quasi-random establishment of Exclusive Economic Zones to estimate the causal effect of marine protected areas on IUU fishing. Our findings suggest that well-enforced no-take reserves can significantly deter IUU incursions, with important heterogeneity based on factors like distance from ports and economic development of adjacent coastal nations.

On the issue of marine pollution, my work has used natural experiments created by differential environmental policies across jurisdictions to estimate the impacts on ocean plastic waste. A stark example comes from examining the effects of China's abrupt 2018 policy banning imports of foreign plastic waste. By comparing highly precise satellite measures of marine plastic concentration before and after the ban for coastal areas globally, we find evidence of large increases in offshore plastic waste for countries that had previously exported much of their plastic waste to China. This highlights that while domestic regulation can effectively reduce a nation's contribution to marine plastic locally, rigorous international policy coordination is essential.  

Looking ahead, an area ripe for further investigation relates to the impacts of ocean acidification and warming on marine ecosystems and fisheries. Laboratory experiments on factors like calcification rates for key species provide concerning projections of potentially severe negative effects from unabated CO2 emissions. An interesting avenue could exploit differential exposures to changing ocean conditions to identify marine heat wave impacts on real-world harvests and biodiversity. While tricky identification issues loom, the threats posed by climate change to the world's oceans make this area of inquiry a high priority.

In contemplating such analyses, we must remain mindful that SDG 14 is inextricably linked to issues of global poverty, food security, economic development and environmental justice. In many coastal regions, marine resources provide the primary source of nutrition and economic livelihood for impoverished communities. Overly restrictive conservation measures, while well-intentioned, could perversely exacerbate these vulnerabilities if not paired with complementary policies to facilitate adaptation and ensure equitable burden-sharing.  

Interdisciplinary collaboration, combining economic tools with ocean and climate science, will be essential for understanding these complex, dynamic systems and charting an evidence-based course towards comprehensive solutions. By bringing rigorous empirical methods to bear, we can cut through rhetoric and advocacy to objectively assess what policy levers prove effective in scaling proven interventions and realizing SDG 14's vision of clean, productive and resilient oceans for future generations.
