As the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, it is my duty to shed light on the intricate relationship between the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14 – Life Below Water – and the plight of refugees worldwide. The displacement of people due to armed conflicts, natural disasters, and environmental degradation is a multifaceted challenge that necessitates a holistic approach, with SDG 14 playing a pivotal role.

The health of our oceans and marine ecosystems is inextricably linked to the well-being of humankind, and this connection becomes even more pronounced when considering the impact on refugees. Many refugee-hosting regions are situated in coastal areas or near water bodies, where the sustainability of marine resources is critical for the survival and resilience of these vulnerable populations.

One cannot overlook the devastating consequences of climate change-induced sea-level rise, coastal erosion, and extreme weather events on communities residing in low-lying coastal areas. These phenomena have already displaced millions of people, with the vast majority being internally displaced persons (IDPs) or seeking refuge in neighboring countries. The loss of livelihoods, homes, and traditional ways of life for these climate refugees poses a significant challenge to their long-term integration and self-reliance.

Furthermore, the degradation of marine ecosystems due to overfishing, pollution, and habitat destruction has far-reaching implications for refugees' food security and economic opportunities. Many refugee communities rely on fishing and coastal tourism for their sustenance and income generation. The depletion of these resources not only exacerbates their vulnerabilities but also heightens the risk of conflicts over scarce resources, further fueling displacement and instability.

Addressing SDG 14 is, therefore, a critical component of efforts to protect and assist refugees. By promoting sustainable fisheries management, combating marine pollution, and conserving coastal and marine areas, we can safeguard the livelihoods and well-being of refugees, particularly those residing in coastal regions or relying on marine resources.

Innovative solutions and partnerships are crucial in this endeavor. For instance, the establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs) can not only preserve biodiversity but also provide alternative livelihood opportunities for refugees through sustainable ecotourism initiatives. Additionally, investing in aquaculture and mariculture projects within refugee settlements can enhance food security while promoting sustainable practices.

It is also imperative to recognize the traditional knowledge and practices of refugees, many of whom have coexisted harmoniously with marine ecosystems for generations. Integrating their perspectives and experiences into conservation efforts can yield invaluable insights and foster a sense of ownership and empowerment among these communities.

Moreover, the nexus between SDG 14 and other SDGs, such as poverty alleviation (SDG 1), good health and well-being (SDG 3), and climate action (SDG 13), cannot be ignored. Holistic approaches that address the interconnected challenges faced by refugees are essential for achieving sustainable solutions.

In conclusion, the pursuit of SDG 14 is not merely an environmental imperative but a humanitarian one as well. By safeguarding the health of our oceans and marine ecosystems, we can foster resilience, promote self-reliance, and ensure the well-being of refugees, particularly those residing in coastal regions or dependent on marine resources. It is a collective responsibility that transcends borders and demands collaborative efforts from governments, international organizations, civil society, and the global community at large.
