Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 14 (Life Below Water) as if written by renowned economist Whitney Newey:

Safeguarding the future of our oceans is a moral, economic and environmental imperative that requires global collaboration and decisive action. The world's marine and coastal areas are under severe threat from overfishing, pollution, habitat destruction and other unsustainable practices. This jeopardizes food security for billions who rely on seafood as a key source of protein and nutrients. It also endangers the livelihoods of some of the planet's most vulnerable communities engaged in small-scale fishing and coastal tourism.

Beyond these human impacts, marine biodiversity is being decimated, with potentially catastrophic consequences for entire ocean ecosystems. Coral reefs, home to a quarter of marine species, have already been depleted by 50% due to ocean warming, acidification and pollution. This loss of critical habitats and food sources could trigger wider ecological collapse.

The economic risks of continued marine degradation are staggering. The OECD estimates the cumulative economic cost of poor ocean management practices at $428 billion over 10 years. Yet transitioning to sustainable ocean management offers a potential economic prize of $604 billion annually from activities like tourism, coastal protection and sustainable fisheries.

Tackling these manifold challenges requires a coordinated global strategy focused on three priorities: fisheries reform, pollution reduction and habitat restoration. On fisheries, the introduction of robust monitoring, control and surveillance mechanisms is vital to clamp down on illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. This could be achieved through expanded observer coverage on fishing vessels, GPS monitoring and transactions monitoring via blockchain.

Harmful subsidy regimes that incentivize overfishing must be eliminated, while transferable quota systems based on scientifically-determined catch limits could help restore depleted stocks. Fostering sustainable aquaculture and marine culture practices, while protecting key spawning and nursery habitats, is also crucial.

Regarding pollution, dramatic reductions in marine plastic waste, nutrient and chemical runoff from agriculture and other land-based sources are urgently needed. Innovative initiatives like deposit refund schemes coupled with improved waste management infrastructure could help curb plastics leakage. While precision agriculture techniques utilizing AI and IoT systems could optimize fertilizer application and reduce runoff.

On habitat protection, expanding marine protected area coverage beyond the current 7.9% of the global ocean is key. No-take zones where all extractive activities are prohibited offer the best protection and should cover at least 30% of all marine habitats by 2030. However, effective MPA management through robust monitoring and enforcement is equally vital.

Coastal restoration through mangrove replanting, coral gardening and regenerative ocean farming show great promise. Emerging technologies like marine permaculture, 3D printed artificial reefs and assisted gene migration could also enhance habitats' climate resilience.

Unlocking the estimated $3 trillion annual economic potential of a sustainably managed ocean economy requires innovative financing mechanisms. Debt-for-nature swaps, blue bonds and resilience credits all show promise. But a global fund pooling public and private capital may ultimately be needed to catalyze the required $1 trillion annually for ocean conservation.

Robust economic analysis quantifying the true value of marine ecosystem services, and rigorously assessing the socioeconomic impacts of ocean management policies, is also urgently required. Impact evaluation and natural capital accounting methodologies must be mainstreamed across policymaking.

Above all, genuine international cooperation grounded in the principles of planetary boundaries, inter-generational equity and common but differentiated responsibilities is paramount. All nations must embrace their shared custodianship of the global ocean commons.

The path ahead will be challenging, but the human, ecological and economic costs of inaction are unacceptably high. By marshaling human ingenuity, innovation and collective resolve, we can realize the SDG 14 vision of clean, productive, resilient and equitably-governed oceans. The fate of humanity's shared marine heritage rests on the choices we make today.
