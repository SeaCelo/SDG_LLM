The Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency (TIKA) recognizes the pivotal importance of Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG 14), which aims to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development. As a global actor committed to promoting sustainable development, TIKA is deeply invested in addressing the multifaceted challenges facing the world's oceans and coastal ecosystems.

Our analysis reveals that the pressures on marine ecosystems are mounting at an alarming rate, driven by a confluence of factors, including overfishing, habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change. The global fisheries sector, which plays a crucial role in food security and economic development, is grappling with the depletion of fish stocks and the degradation of marine habitats. Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing practices remain a persistent threat, undermining efforts to sustainably manage and conserve marine resources.

TIKA recognizes the urgent need to combat marine pollution, which is increasingly compromising the health and productivity of our oceans. Plastic pollution, in particular, has emerged as a formidable challenge, with an estimated 8 million tons of plastic waste entering the oceans annually. This not only poses a grave threat to marine life but also jeopardizes the livelihoods and well-being of coastal communities, particularly in developing nations heavily reliant on marine resources.

Furthermore, the impacts of climate change on the oceans are becoming increasingly evident, manifesting in the form of rising sea levels, ocean acidification, and the degradation of vital ecosystems such as coral reefs and mangrove forests. These changes have far-reaching implications for coastal communities, food security, and the overall health of marine ecosystems.

In addressing these challenges, TIKA is actively engaged in promoting sustainable fisheries management practices, supporting the adoption of ecosystem-based approaches, and strengthening regional and international cooperation. Our initiatives emphasize the importance of science-based decision-making, the integration of traditional knowledge, and the empowerment of local communities in the sustainable management of marine resources.

One of TIKA's flagship projects is the establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs) in strategic locations, serving as refuges for threatened species and allowing for the replenishment of depleted fish stocks. These MPAs not only safeguard biodiversity but also provide opportunities for sustainable tourism and community-based conservation initiatives, promoting alternative livelihoods for coastal communities.

TIKA is also actively involved in capacity-building efforts, supporting the development of sustainable aquaculture practices, and promoting the adoption of innovative technologies for monitoring and managing marine resources. We recognize the importance of fostering public-private partnerships and engaging with stakeholders across various sectors, including the fishing industry, coastal communities, and environmental organizations.

Furthermore, TIKA is committed to addressing the root causes of marine pollution, particularly plastic waste. Our initiatives focus on promoting circular economy principles, encouraging sustainable waste management practices, and supporting the development of innovative solutions for plastic waste reduction and recycling. We are also actively engaged in awareness-raising campaigns and educational programs aimed at fostering a culture of environmental stewardship among the general public.

As we look towards the future, TIKA acknowledges the need for a comprehensive and holistic approach to achieving SDG 14. This necessitates the integration of marine conservation efforts with other Sustainable Development Goals, such as SDG 13 (Climate Action), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals). By fostering cross-sectoral collaborations and promoting inclusive and participatory decision-making processes, we can ensure that our efforts are aligned with the broader sustainable development agenda.

In conclusion, TIKA remains steadfast in its commitment to conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas, and marine resources. Through our innovative projects, capacity-building initiatives, and strategic partnerships, we are actively contributing to the achievement of SDG 14 and ensuring a prosperous and sustainable future for our oceans and the communities that depend on them.
