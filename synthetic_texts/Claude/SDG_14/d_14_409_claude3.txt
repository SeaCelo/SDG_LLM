Compassion International's commitment to Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG 14), which aims to "conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development," is a multifaceted endeavor that requires a holistic approach encompassing environmental, socioeconomic, and governance dimensions.

Our organization recognizes the intrinsic link between the well-being of coastal communities and the health of marine ecosystems. Overfishing, pollution, and climate change-induced ocean acidification and warming pose severe threats to the livelihoods of these vulnerable populations, who often rely heavily on marine resources for sustenance and income generation.

Through our community-based initiatives, we prioritize empowering local stakeholders to actively participate in the sustainable management of their marine resources. This involves fostering collaborations between traditional knowledge holders, such as artisanal fisherfolk and indigenous groups, and scientific experts to develop context-specific solutions that balance conservation efforts with the socioeconomic needs of these communities.

One notable example is our work in the Philippines, where we have partnered with local organizations to establish community-led marine protected areas (MPAs). These designated zones not only safeguard critical habitats like coral reefs and mangrove forests but also serve as replenishment zones for fish stocks, ensuring long-term sustainability of artisanal fisheries. Complementing these efforts, we provide capacity-building and alternative livelihood training programs to reduce fishing pressure and diversify income sources for coastal residents.

Furthermore, our initiatives emphasize the importance of addressing the root causes of marine pollution, particularly plastic waste. Through awareness campaigns and partnerships with recycling initiatives, we aim to reduce the influx of land-based debris into the oceans, thereby mitigating the detrimental impact on marine life and ecosystems.

Recognizing the transboundary nature of marine challenges, we actively engage in regional and global advocacy efforts to promote sustainable ocean governance. Our organization plays a pivotal role in amplifying the voices of marginalized coastal communities on international platforms, advocating for inclusive decision-making processes and the integration of their perspectives into policies and strategies aimed at achieving SDG 14.

Notably, we have collaborated with various stakeholders, including governments, intergovernmental organizations, and civil society groups, to support the implementation of the United Nations' legally binding instrument on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ). This groundbreaking agreement holds the potential to establish a comprehensive governance framework for the high seas, which have long suffered from a lack of effective regulation and management.

Moreover, our organization recognizes the interconnectedness of the SDGs and the need for a holistic approach to sustainable development. We actively promote synergies between SDG 14 and other goals, such as SDG 1 (No Poverty), SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), and SDG 13 (Climate Action). By addressing the multifaceted challenges faced by coastal communities, we aim to alleviate poverty, improve food security, and enhance resilience to the impacts of climate change.

Through our comprehensive and multidimensional approach, Compassion International remains steadfast in its commitment to achieving SDG 14, recognizing that the conservation and sustainable use of marine resources are not only essential for the well-being of coastal communities but also critical for the overall health of our planet and the prosperity of future generations.
