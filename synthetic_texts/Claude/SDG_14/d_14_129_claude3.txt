Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 14 (Life Below Water) written from the perspective of George Monbiot:

The Veiled Plunder of the Seas: How Humanity's Disregard for Ocean Life Undermines Sustainable Development

By George Monbiot

The wondrous depths of our oceans, teeming with kaleidoscopic life forms and vast, unexplored ecosystems, have long been treated as a boundless larder by the human species. For centuries, we have plundered these marine realms with a rapacious zeal, driven by greed, apathy and a deluded belief in their inexhaustibility. The relentless industrial fishing expeditions laid waste to entire species, while our toxic effluents poisoned and choked vibrant coral habitats into ghostly graveyards. All this carnage was dismissed as a mere inconvenience – an externality that the lords of commerce could easily absorb.  

Yet the reckoning that environmentalists long warned about is now upon us. The insatiable appetites of the global fishing industry, combined with the oceans' accelerating accumulation of plastic waste, global warming, acidification, and coastal pollution, have pushed marine ecosystems to the brink of collapse. According to the UN, over 30% of marine stocks are now overfished, while nearly 60% are fully exploited. The coral reefs that once housed a quarter of all marine life are dying at an alarming rate. The numbers make a compelling case for urgent action, yet the political establishments have responded with half-measures and feeble commitments.

The 14th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) lays out an ambitious roadmap for conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas and marine resources for development. It calls for reducing marine pollution, managing and protecting marine and coastal ecosystems, regulating fishing practices, increasing scientific knowledge and transfer of marine technology, and providing access for small-scale fishers to marine resources and markets. Laudable objectives, no doubt, but ones that require a fundamental restructuring of the current ocean exploitation paradigm.

The lofty pronouncements about "sustainable use" ring hollow when examined through the lens of our prevailing practices. Industrial fishing fleets continue to ruthlessly strip-mine the oceans using techniques akin to clear-cutting ancient forests. Bottom trawlers indiscriminately plow and pulverize sea beds, turning once-thriving ecosystems into barren, lifeless plains. Driftnets stretch for kilometers, ensnaring everything in their wake from whales to turtles. And after this massacre,the unwanted "bycatch" that happens to survive is casually tossed back into the ocean as discards, ensuring further decimation of threatened species. This scorched earth approach is then cynically relabeled "sustainable" by pliable bureaucrats and policy regimes bought by fishing lobbies.

The same corporations driving this plunder also happen to be the world's biggest polluters and plastic manufacturers. Their products and industrial effluents end up saturating the marine environment with toxic synthetics like PVC, BPA, dioxins and phthalates – pollutants that effectively sterilize aquatic ecosystems while passing through the food chain to contaminate our own bodies. So while they blithely market "sustainable" seafood, their other undertakings actively sabotage the very conditions required for marine sustainability.

If we are to make meaningful progress on SDG 14, a radical course correction is imperative. We must reckon with the fundamental drivers of unsustainable ocean exploitation, rather than merely tinkering around the edges with market-based band-aids and corporate greenwashing. The ocean grabbing precipitated by extractive industries must be halted and space made for traditional, community-controlled fishing practices that respect ecological limits. No-take marine reserves must expand to encompass a majority of the world's oceans. Land-based sources of pollution need to be regulated with a scorched earth policy of our own – one targeting the petrochemical sectors and industrial supply chains choking marine life with a stream of hazardous runoff.

Perhaps most critically, we must overturn the privatization of ocean resources and reassert the principle of global commons and custodianship. The high seas and coastal waters cannot be safeguarded if corporations and nations are permitted to stake claims and secure extraction rights in perpetuity. These natural realms are the common inheritance of all humanity – present and future – and it is our collective responsibility to steward them. Any approach to sustainable development will remain farcical until we reject the tyranny of corporate appetites and reframe our relationship with oceanic ecosystems around preservation over perpetual consumption.

The path ahead is one of stark choices and outright defiance of dominant institutional powers. But the alternative – an inhospitable, marine desert devoid of the wonders that have anchored human civilization since antiquity – is too bleak to countenance. We owe it to succeeding generations to chart a different course, one rooted in humility, wisdom and reverence for the natural world. Our survival as a species may well depend on it.
