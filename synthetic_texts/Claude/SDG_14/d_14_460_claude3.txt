Blue Economy, Green Profits: Investing in SDG 14 for Financial and Environmental Returns

By the Kiplinger's Investing Team

When it comes to sustainable investing strategies and achieving the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, most investors tend to focus on initiatives relating to clean energy, responsible production, and climate action. However, there is an untapped "blue economy" tied to SDG 14 - Life Below Water - that represents a compelling financial opportunity on top of its environmental importance.

SDG 14 aims to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development. The challenges are immense, with overfishing, plastic pollution, warming waters, and acidification posing major threats. But tackling these issues and pivoting towards a blue economy based on sustainable marine industries also unlocks trillion-dollar market opportunities.

Consider the numbers: The OECD estimates the ocean economy's value at $1.5 trillion annually, employing over 31 million people. Sustainable use of marine resources is predicted to outperform the growth of the global economy as a whole in coming decades. From sustainable seafood and offshore wind to marine biotech and eco-tourism, the investment potential is vast.

Oceans as Economic Engines 
Many investors think investing in the blue economy only involves clean-up projects or protection initiatives. While those are vital, the blue economy actually encompasses a wide array of established and emerging industries leveraging the oceans' bounty of natural capital in a sustainable manner.

Aquaculture, for instance, supplies over half the world's seafood and is a $264 billion industry. But unsustainable practices and diseases have capped growth. By investing in sustainable aquaculture upstarts utilizing technology like offshore multi-trophic systems, investors can benefit from triple-digit growth projections over 10 years.

Then there's the burgeoning marine biotech sector, which harnesses biodiversity from seas and coastlines to develop new drugs, industrial enzymes, bio-plastics and more. The marine biotech market could top $6.4 billion by 2025 according to BCC Research. Innovative startups isolating compounds from marine microbes, plants and other organisms are prime investment candidates.

Offshore wind, marine robotics and renewable ocean energy systems like tidal and wave power are other flourishing blue economy fields. With over 80% of the world's ocean unmapped and unexplored, opportunities abound in deep-sea mining, maritime robotics and underwater surveying equipment.

Profiting from Positive Impacts
Crucially, these economic opportunities are intrinsically linked to sustainability and environmental protection. Sustainable aquaculture reduces pressure on overfished wild stocks while marine vegetation like seaweeds captures carbon. Microplastic waste products could be made obsolete by biodegradable biopolymers derived from marine life. Seagrass restoration and coastal replanting generate carbon offsets.

Marine conservation and "biosphere reserve" economic models can open new revenue streams from eco-tourism while protecting biodiversity hotspots. Piggybacking on the success of ecotourism investing, marine reserves and natural underwater attractions could explode in value.

Companies innovating solutions to SDG 14 challenges stand to benefit from first-mover advantages in nascent fields, government incentives, and sustainability investment capital flows. According to the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), $4 of every $10 of assets under management now integrates sustainability and ESG factors.

Surfing the Blue Wave
Individual investors can access diversified blue economy exposure through thematic exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on water/ocean themes. ETFs like the Defiance NFTZ Maritime Logistics/Shipping ETF (DRIP) offer access to maritime shipping and freight logistics companies improving efficiencies. Others rotate across water industry subsectors like desalination, utilities, water treatment and aquaculture.

On the equities side, companies like vegetarian supplement specialist Corbion and natural ingredients/biopolymers producer Novozymes demonstrate leadership in marine biotechnology innovation. Medical companies sourcing potential treatments from the ocean, such as automated drug discovery platform Cyclica, are intriguing speculative biotech plays.

Smaller pure-play contenders include sustainable shellfish producers like Catalina Sea Ranch and innovative aquaculture technology providers like Tipping Mare's automated feeding systems and XpertSea's shrimp growth modeling via computer vision. Investors should weigh risks against growth potential carefully.

Ultimately, investing in SDG 14 aligns environmental preservation, sustainable natural resource utilization, and profitability. For investors seeking pacesetter exposure to the blue economy, the diversification benefits and thematic growth potential could make SDG 14 a quintessential sustainable investment opportunity.
