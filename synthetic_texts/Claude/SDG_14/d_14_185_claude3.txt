Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 14 (Life Below Water) from the perspective of political cartoonist and columnist Ted Rall:

Our Oceans Are in Crisis - Thanks to Capitalism and Corrupt Politicians

The rape of the world's oceans is one of capitalism's greatest crimes against humanity and the planet. The seas, which cover 71% of the Earth's surface and contain 97% of its water, are being destroyed by corporate greed, unlawful overfishing, and a callous disregard for environmental protection by the very governments entrusted to safeguard this vital global commons.

Sustainable Development Goal 14 calls for the world to "conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development." But more than a slogan is needed to counter the perfect storm of threats killing ocean life at a terrifying pace.

With marine biodiversity plunging by as much as half in the past four decades, dire projections warn that at current rates, the world's fisheries will be utterly depleted by 2048. Overfishing is just one culprit, enabled by advances in technology that have rendered obsolete traditional controls like limiting boat sizes and engine horsepower. Ravenous industrial fishing operations relentlessly scour the seas using sonar to hunt down the last remaining schools.

This senseless slaughter isn't just eliminating the food source for a billion of the world's poorest people. Bottom trawlers are turning swaths of ocean floor into barren, lifeless deserts. Discarded plastic pollution forms massive garbage patches, choking marine life. And then there's the existential threat of climate change, which is warming and acidifying ocean waters, killing coral reefs while depleting oxygen levels.

Corporations and the billionaire class are fracking our oceans to death - both literally by offshore drilling that has devastated ecosystems from the Gulf of Mexico to Southeast Asia, and metaphorically through carbon emissions overheating the planet. The petrochemical giants like Exxon and Shell have known about climate change for decades but covered it up, continuing to profit by sacrificing the seas and the 3 billion people who depend on them.

Just as unforgivable are the myriad governments around the world, corrupted by corporate money and backdoor lobbying, that fail to enforce what paltry environmental regulations exist, let alone implement bold new policies to protect marine environments. Nations that claim stewardship over "sovereign waters" hypocritically allow their industrial fishing fleets to decimate international waters. Even the United Nations proves toothless at checking this ecocide.

There's no lack of solutions if we had real political will. We must drastically cut carbon emissions and transition to clean energy to limit further ocean warming and acidification. No-catch Marine Protected Areas where fishing is prohibited need to rapidly expand to 30% of the world's oceans. Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing must be eliminated through a global enforcement body with real powers to board, inspect, and arrest offenders. Destructive practices like bottom trawling should be banned. Developing countries need aid to establish sustainable fisheries management.

But such measures cut into corporate profits and rob political elites of their bribes and dark money slush funds. So instead of action, we get empty rhetoric and trivial tweaks around the margins as the clock keeps ticking. The oceans are resilient, but not infinitely so. At the current rate, we may soon reach a point of no return.

History will judge us harshly for savaging our seas with short-term greed while millions starve and marine ecosystems collapse into dead zones. There's still time to change course, but the window is closing rapidly on whether we'll have fish or biodiversity in the oceans for our grandchildren to inherit. If we fail to meet SDG 14's modest targets, it will be the ultimate proof capitalism has become a fetish that values profits over human life itself.
