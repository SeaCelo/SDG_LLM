The Center for Victims of Torture presents a comprehensive analysis of the intricate interplay between Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG 14) – "Life Below Water" – and the global crisis of torture and human rights violations. This report delves into the multifaceted nexus of environmental degradation, resource exploitation, and the heightened vulnerability of marginalized communities to torture and abuse.

Coastal and island communities, often reliant on marine resources for subsistence and livelihoods, face disproportionate exposure to the cascading consequences of climate change, overfishing, and pollution. As these communities grapple with diminishing fish stocks, habitat destruction, and the loss of traditional ways of life, they become increasingly susceptible to exploitation, human trafficking, and forced labor – forms of modern-day slavery that constitute torture under international law.

The report highlights the plight of artisanal fisherfolk and indigenous coastal communities, whose traditional fishing grounds and marine ecosystems are threatened by industrial-scale fishing operations, offshore oil and gas exploration, and the pervasive problem of plastic pollution. As their means of sustenance dwindle, these communities are rendered more vulnerable to coercion, intimidation, and the deprivation of their fundamental human rights.

Furthermore, the report examines the complex dynamics of conflict and resource scarcity in coastal regions. The depletion of marine resources and the degradation of vital ecosystems, such as mangrove forests and coral reefs, can exacerbate existing tensions and fuel conflicts over access to dwindling resources. In such volatile environments, torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment often become tools of oppression, further marginalizing and traumatizing vulnerable populations.

The analysis also sheds light on the plight of migrants and refugees fleeing environmental degradation, natural disasters, and conflicts exacerbated by resource scarcity. These individuals, already traumatized by the loss of their homes and livelihoods, are at heightened risk of exploitation, human trafficking, and torture during their perilous journeys and upon reaching their destinations.

Recognizing the inextricable link between environmental degradation and human rights violations, the report calls for a holistic, multi-stakeholder approach to addressing SDG 14. It emphasizes the need for robust governance frameworks, sustainable fisheries management practices, and the protection of marine ecosystems to safeguard the livelihoods and well-being of coastal communities.

Moreover, the report underscores the importance of empowering local communities, promoting gender equality, and ensuring the meaningful participation of indigenous peoples and marginalized groups in decision-making processes related to marine resource management. By addressing the root causes of vulnerability and fostering resilient, sustainable communities, we can mitigate the risk of torture and human rights violations in coastal regions.

The report concludes with a call to action, urging governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector to prioritize the protection of marine ecosystems and the promotion of human rights, particularly for those most vulnerable to the intersecting challenges of environmental degradation and torture.
