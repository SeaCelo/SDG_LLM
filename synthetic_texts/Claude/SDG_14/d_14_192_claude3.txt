Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 14 - Life Below Water, written from the perspective of economist Thomas Sowell:

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 14 aims to "conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development." On the surface, this appears to be a lofty and virtuous aspiration. However, a deeper examination reveals both conceptual flaws and practical obstacles that should give us pause.

Fundamentally, the notion of sustainable development itself is problematic from an economic standpoint. It implies a static world where resource utilization can be frozen at some sustainable equilibrium level. But the real world is a disequilibrating process of gales of creative destruction, to use Schumpeter's felicitous phrase. Resources are constantly being exploited, exhausted, and then replaced by human ingenuity discovering new resources, extraction technologies, and substitutes.

The oceans predate modern humans by billions of years. To imagine that contemporary human activity could somehow upset their perpetual existence is hubristic in the extreme. Throughout the vast spans of geological history, the oceans have endured far more cataclysmic upheavals than anything modern industrial society could unleash, from massive meteor strikes to epochal climate shifts and supervolcano eruptions. To presume that the oceans now require human oversight and intervention to preserve them in a particular desired state is sheer anthropocentric conceit.

Moreover, history has shown time and again that common resources unowned by anyone are invariably mismanaged through the tragedy of the commons effect. Overfishing and marine pollution persist precisely because the oceans are open-access resources belonging to nobody in particular. It is only through the establishment and enforcement of well-defined property rights that we have any chance of aligning the incentives for preservation and sustainable harvesting.

Even if we were to accept the SDG's premise, the proposed methods for achieving it are deeply flawed from an economic perspective. The underlying policy prescriptions smack of the pernicious "cult of the anointed" mindset â€“ the belief that grand utopian goals can simply be centrally mandated and achieved through top-down government control and regulation.

But seventy years of comprehensive evidence from the world's diverse nations demonstrates conclusively that such command-and-control policies are a recipe for counterproductive inefficiencies, unintended consequences, regulatory capture by special interests, and large-scale private costs imposed on ordinary citizens. Many fisheries around the world have already collapsed under the weight of government quotas, subsidies, and other misguided interventions that undermine rational market incentives for conservation.

Ironically, SDG 14 may end up doing more harm than good by promoting the same discredited centralized planning approach that has already exacerbated marine degradation in many regions. If the goal's architects were truly interested in protecting oceanic resources for future generations, they would look to secure property rights, economic freedom, and minimally-intrusive governance as proven pathways to incentivize sustainable development.

The road to ecological preservation is paved not with top-down diktats, but with clearly defined legal structures that harmonize private interests with the long-term good through the metaphysical extended order of the market. Decentralized entrepreneurial approaches like aquaculture and privately-managed marine reserves hold far more promise than grandiose international plans imposed by a transnational regulatory apparatus unmoored from economic realities.

As with many other well-intentioned UN goals and programs, SDG 14 seems unlikely to make meaningful real-world progress in conserving marine resources. More likely, it will serve as a vehicle for symbolic virtuosignaling by privileged elite interests while imposing real economic costs on the world's poorest and most vulnerable populations. A far more fruitful path would be to discard such utopian schemes entirely and simply secure property rights and the rule of law as a foundation for markets to transmit accurate price signals and foster harmonious stewardship.
