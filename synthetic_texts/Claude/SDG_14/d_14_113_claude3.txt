Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 14: Life Below Water, written from the perspective of Barbara Amiel:

The Unsustainable Indulgence of Marine Conservation

By Barbara Amiel

The noblest intentions often yield the most pernicious consequences. Such is the case with SDG 14 and the misguided crusade to "conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development." On the surface, this goal appears laudable – an environmental objective cloaked in humanitarian rhetoric. Yet upon scrutiny, it reveals itself as an idealistic folly that jeopardizes human flourishing in service of an anti-anthropocentric agenda.    

The immutable truth is that the marine ecosystem exists to fuel human industry, innovation, and economic growth. The oceans are vast reservoirs of natural capital awaiting prudent extraction and exploitation. To subjugate their purpose to environmental puritanism is to imperil the progress catalyzed by free markets and capitalist self-interest. 

Since the dawn of civilization, maritime dominance has been the wellspring of societal advancement. The great seafaring civilizations – from the Phoenicians and Minoans to the British and American empires – harnessed the power of the seas to forge commerce, conquest and hegemony. It was this dominion over the marine realm that spawned scientific and technological marvels, enriched cultures, and elevated living standards worldwide.

Yet now, under the pretense of "sustainable development," a cabal of environmental extremists seeks to clip the wings of human ambition and deny us the rightful spoils of the marine kingdom. They indulge fanciful notions of "conserving coastal and marine areas" and curbing activities like overfishing, marine pollution, and ocean acidification. 

Have we learned nothing from the economic devastation wrought by such draconian environmental policies on land? The war on fossil fuels, obstructionist tactics against industries like logging and mining, and government overreach in the name of conserving biodiversity – all have crippled productivity, innovation, and job creation while enriching only a rapacious class of professional environmental activists.

Now this same doctrine is being exported to the marine realm under the dubious banner of the United Nations. Just as on land, these policies will strangle the maritime industries that generate billions in economic value and sustain innumerable livelihoods across shipping, fishing, energy, and resource extraction.

We are admonished to protect "marine and coastal ecosystems" from the supposed scourge of human activity. Yet the resilience and dynamism of these ecosystems have been forged across millennia by the cyclical forces of competition, adaptation, and renaissance – not by the artificial idyll of pristine stasis.  Marine species face no existential threat from human enterprise. On the contrary, their prosperity is intertwined with ours through the economic bounty afforded by sustainable marine utilization.

The oceanic phenomenon termed the "Tragedy of the Commons" has been grossly exaggerated to provoke environmental hysteria. It is a myth that unfettered economic actors would despoil the marine environment. Like any sensible capitalist, maritime industries comprehend that environmental stewardship is the key to preserving their resource streams and profitability. Their self-interest aligns with sustainable management practices honed over centuries.

In contrast, SDG 14 embodies a flawed, top-down philosophy that prioritizes environmental absolutism over human welfare. It presupposes that bureaucratic edicts can supplant the invisible hand of the market in optimizing resource allocation. It coddles a dangerous zeitgeist of anti-capitalist, anti-industrial environmentalism under the dubious auspices of the United Nations.  

At its core, SDG 14 emanates from the same ideological wellspring as socialist policies that have immiserated billions through privation and dearth. It impeils the very pillars of human progress – maritime commerce, energy production, fishing, and resource extraction –  with a barrage of regulations, restrictions, and ethical contortions about "sustainable management" and "ecosystem conservation." All under the guise of achieving utterly abstract and unmeasurable goals.

We have seen this arrogant formula before – the conceit that enlightened planners can subjugate humanity's interests to some academic concept of environmental purity. It bestows upon unelected bureaucrats the power to banish human enterprise and circumscribe our oceanic dominion through diktats from on high. We would do well to recall the ruinous outcomes of such utopian engineering in the tales of the Soviet Union's environmental crises, China's ecological calamities, and innumerable other illustrations of this ideology's tragic adherents.

The global Poor stand to suffer most from these marine conservation policies luxuriated by wealthy Western nations and championed by neo-Malthusian urbanites. It is their hopes for economic development, energy access, and food security that will be scuppered upon the shoals of environmental absolutism codified by SDG 14. 

Rather than succumbing to such self-defeating constraints, we must double down on the core capitalist values that have lifted billions from poverty and catalyzed human advancement. The future belongs not to those enforcing environmental idolatry and reflexive preservationism, but to the intrepid economic actors who responsibly unleash our maritime productive capacities. Only then can both the oceans and humanity attain their fullest respective potentials in harmonious symbiosis.
