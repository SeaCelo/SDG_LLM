The Palestinian International Cooperation Agency (PICA) presents this analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG 14): Life Below Water, which aims to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development. Given Palestine's unique geopolitical situation and lack of direct coastal access, our analysis focuses on the broader regional implications and interconnected nature of marine ecosystems.

While Palestine itself does not have a coastline, the health of the Mediterranean Sea directly impacts the country's environment, economy, and people. The Mediterranean basin is a semi-enclosed sea, and its waters are shared by over 20 countries, including Palestine's neighbors. Marine pollution, overfishing, and coastal degradation in one area can have far-reaching consequences for the entire region.

One of the most pressing issues is the alarmingly high levels of plastic pollution in the Mediterranean Sea. According to recent studies, the Mediterranean is one of the most polluted seas globally, with an estimated 3,760 tons of plastic waste entering its waters every day. This plastic pollution not only threatens marine life but also has severe economic implications for sectors like tourism and fishing, which are crucial for many Mediterranean countries, including Palestine's neighbors.

Furthermore, the Mediterranean Sea is a biodiversity hotspot, home to numerous endemic species found nowhere else on Earth. However, overfishing, habitat destruction, and climate change are putting immense pressure on these fragile ecosystems. The depletion of fish stocks and the degradation of coastal habitats like mangroves and seagrass beds could have far-reaching consequences for food security, livelihoods, and the resilience of coastal communities in the region.

Climate change is also exacerbating the challenges faced by the Mediterranean Sea. Rising sea levels, ocean acidification, and warming waters are altering the marine environment, affecting everything from coral reefs to migratory patterns of fish species. These changes could have profound implications for the Palestinian economy, which relies heavily on agriculture and food imports from neighboring countries.

To address these challenges, PICA advocates for a comprehensive regional approach that recognizes the interconnected nature of the Mediterranean Sea and its importance for the entire region's sustainable development. This includes:

1. Strengthening regional cooperation and governance frameworks to address transboundary issues like marine pollution, overfishing, and habitat degradation.
2. Investing in sustainable blue economy initiatives that promote responsible stewardship of marine resources while creating economic opportunities for coastal communities.
3. Enhancing scientific research and monitoring efforts to better understand the impacts of human activities and climate change on the Mediterranean Sea.
4. Promoting public awareness and education campaigns to foster a sense of shared responsibility for the health of the Mediterranean Sea among all stakeholders, including Palestinian communities.
5. Advocating for the inclusion of marine conservation and sustainable use in national and regional development strategies, recognizing the vital role of healthy oceans in achieving the broader Sustainable Development Goals.

By adopting a holistic and collaborative approach, PICA believes that Palestine and its neighbors can play a crucial role in safeguarding the Mediterranean Sea and ensuring its long-term sustainability. This not only supports SDG 14 but also contributes to the achievement of other interlinked goals, such as poverty alleviation, food security, and climate action.
