The International Organization for Migration (IOM) recognizes the pivotal role of Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG 14) in safeguarding the world's marine and coastal ecosystems, which are inextricably linked to the well-being of millions of people, including migrant communities. As an intergovernmental organization committed to humane and orderly migration, IOM understands the profound impact of healthy oceans on livelihoods, food security, and the resilience of vulnerable populations.

The global context surrounding SDG 14 is alarming. Oceans are under unprecedented stress from human activities, including overfishing, pollution, habitat destruction, and the compounding effects of climate change. This has severe implications for coastal communities, many of which rely heavily on marine resources for subsistence and economic opportunities. The depletion of fish stocks, coral reef degradation, and coastal erosion can trigger displacement, poverty, and resource conflicts, exacerbating migration pressures.

IOM's approach to SDG 14 is rooted in a comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between environmental factors, human mobility, and sustainable development. We recognize that achieving the targets of SDG 14 is not solely an environmental endeavor but a multidimensional challenge that requires addressing socioeconomic, governance, and cultural aspects.

One of the key areas of focus for IOM is the intersection between SDG 14 and migration dynamics. In coastal regions affected by environmental degradation, declining fish stocks, and sea-level rise, migration can be a coping mechanism for affected communities. However, unplanned and unmanaged migration can strain resources and exacerbate existing vulnerabilities in destination areas, potentially leading to further environmental degradation and social tensions. IOM works closely with governments, communities, and partners to develop proactive and holistic strategies that address the root causes of environmentally induced migration while promoting sustainable livelihoods and resilience.

IOM's efforts encompass capacity building, policy development, and innovative solutions tailored to local contexts. For instance, in regions where overfishing and coastal habitat destruction threaten the livelihoods of artisanal fishing communities, IOM supports the implementation of sustainable fishing practices, alternative livelihood opportunities, and community-based coastal resource management. This holistic approach not only contributes to the conservation of marine ecosystems but also mitigates the drivers of migration by enhancing economic resilience and food security.

Furthermore, IOM recognizes the disproportionate impact of environmental degradation on marginalized groups, including women, indigenous communities, and migrants themselves. We actively promote inclusive and gender-responsive policies and programs that empower these groups to participate in decision-making processes and access livelihood opportunities related to sustainable ocean management.

IOM's efforts also extend to addressing the challenges posed by climate change and its impact on ocean ecosystems. We collaborate with partners to support coastal communities in adapting to sea-level rise, extreme weather events, and other climate-related threats. This includes initiatives such as ecosystem-based adaptation, disaster risk reduction, and community-based early warning systems, all of which contribute to enhancing the resilience of coastal populations and reducing the need for displacement.

Underpinning IOM's work on SDG 14 is a strong emphasis on international cooperation and multi-stakeholder partnerships. We actively engage with governments, civil society organizations, private sector entities, and other relevant stakeholders to foster collaborative efforts, knowledge sharing, and coordinated actions towards achieving the targets of SDG 14. This includes promoting policy coherence, facilitating cross-border cooperation, and leveraging the expertise and resources of diverse actors.

In conclusion, IOM's approach to SDG 14 is holistic, integrating environmental, social, economic, and migration dimensions. By addressing the root causes of environmentally induced migration, promoting sustainable livelihoods, and enhancing the resilience of coastal communities, IOM contributes to the conservation and sustainable use of marine resources while ensuring the well-being and dignity of migrant and non-migrant populations alike.
