Regarding Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG 14) on life below water, the Chilean Agency for International Cooperation has conducted a comprehensive analysis of the current situation, challenges, and opportunities for achieving this goal in Latin America and beyond.

The importance of preserving oceans and marine resources cannot be overstated. Oceans are a fundamental pillar of life on our planet, regulating the climate, providing food and livelihoods for millions, and hosting rich biodiversity. However, human activities such as overfishing, pollution, and climate change have placed unprecedented pressure on marine ecosystems, endangering their health and resilience.

In Chile, a coastal nation with an extensive Pacific Ocean shoreline, conserving marine resources is of vital importance. The country has implemented several measures to address challenges related to marine life, including the establishment of marine protected areas, regulation of fishing activities, and efforts to reduce marine pollution.

Nevertheless, significant gaps remain to be addressed. Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing continues to pose a major challenge, threatening the sustainability of fish stocks and the livelihoods of coastal communities. Additionally, plastic and other marine waste pollution has reached alarming levels, with severe consequences for biodiversity and human health.

In this context, regional and international cooperation is crucial. Chile has played an active role in promoting initiatives such as the Permanent Commission for the South Pacific (CPPS) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), which aim to foster the sustainable management of marine resources and the protection of the marine environment.

However, achieving meaningful progress on SDG 14 requires a holistic and integrated approach. This involves addressing the underlying causes of marine degradation, such as unsustainable production and consumption patterns, low public awareness, and weak governance.

In this regard, education and awareness play a fundamental role. Strengthening educational programs that promote understanding of the importance of oceans and marine resources and encourage sustainable practices across all stages of the marine-related value chain is essential.

Furthermore, innovation and technology transfer are critical for developing more efficient and environmentally friendly solutions. For example, the development of more selective fishing methods and the implementation of remote monitoring systems can help mitigate the impact of fishing activities on marine ecosystems.

Ultimately, achieving SDG 14 requires a multidisciplinary approach and close collaboration between the public and private sectors and civil society. Only through coordinated efforts and concrete actions can we protect and restore marine life, ensuring a sustainable future for our oceans and generations to come.
