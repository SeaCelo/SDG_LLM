Here is a long academic article about SDG 14 (Life Below Water), written from the perspective of Tina Dupuy:

The Troubling Depths: An Unflinching Look at SDG 14 and the Crisis in Our Oceans

By Tina Dupuy

The ocean has long been a life source for our planet, teeming with vibrant ecosystems that produce half of the world's oxygen and absorb 30% of carbon dioxide emissions. Yet, for far too long, we've taken this invaluable resource for granted, recklessly plundering its riches and poisoning its waters under the misguided assumption that the seas are too vast to be impacted by human activity. How painfully wrong we were.

The facts are as sobering as they are infuriating: Overfishing has decimated global fish stocks, with 90% either fully exploited or overfished. Vast swaths of coastal waters are severely polluted by agricultural runoff, untreated sewage, and plastic waste, creating dead zones devoid of oxygen and marine life. Our addiction to fossil fuels is warming and acidifying the oceans at an alarming rate, dissolving shells and coral skeletons while fueling more intense storms that ravage coastal communities.

And let's not mince words: We are the architects of this catastrophe. Humanity's insatiable appetite for marine resources and startling indifference toward the consequences has pushed the oceans to the brink of collapse. Overfishing has not only destroyed fish populations but upended the entire oceanic food web. The very biodiversity that gives the oceans resilience is being ripped away thread by thread.

Nowhere is the destruction more visceral than the scourge of plastic waste poisoning our seas. Some 8 million metric tons of plastic enters the oceans annually, plastic production having increased 20-fold since 1964. There is now a garbage patch twice the size of Texas swirling in the Pacific, an unholy monument to our shameful negligence. Microplastics, those insidious shards ingested by marine life, have now pervaded the entire oceanic food chain, even appearing in our own diet. We are, quite literally, eating away at the oceans.

The impacts on human welfare have been nothing short of catastrophic, particularly in developing coastal and island nations where millions rely on fisheries for sustenance and livelihood. Destroyed fish stocks and ecosystems have perpetuated cycles of poverty, malnutrition, and economic stagnation. Sea level rise has displaced tens of millions of people and will render whole nations uninhabitable if unabated. 

If these realities weren't dire enough, consider the cascading impacts of a destabilized ocean system. The oceans are the primary drivers of climate and weather systems; disrupt them, and we endanger the entire planet's life support. We rely on oceans for oxygen, water cycles, temperature regulation, and carbon sequestration. The collapse of the marine food web would upend the planetary balance.

With stakes this high, the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 14 – "Life Below Water" – represents not just a noble aspiration, but an existential imperative to reverse the oceans' catastrophic decline before we cross a point of no return. Achieving this goal requires acknowledging the sobering truth: For too long, we've sacrificed environmental responsibility for short-term economic gain, valuing profits over preservation. 

We cannot afford such reckless myopia any longer. SDG 14 calls for ending overfishing, eliminating plastic pollution, minimizing marine acidification, and protecting at least 10% of coastal and marine areas by 2020. Meeting these targets demands a radical restructuring of human systems and priorities.

On overfishing, we must move rapidly toward sustainable harvesting that respects biological boundaries and replenishes fish stocks. Harmful subsidies must be eliminated and exploitative practices like bottom trawling banned. Coastal communities must be empowered with rights over their waters and given sustainable economic alternatives beyond plundering the seas.

Plastic pollution can only be resolved by transforming the global plastics industry through aggressive regulation, extended producer responsibility policies, investment in innovative materials, and a fundamental shift in consumer behavior. This is an all-hands battle to stem the plastic tide.

To address acidification and oxygen depletion, we have no choice but to rapidly decarbonize the global economy, transitioning away from fossil fuels towards clean, renewable energy while developing technologies to remove excess carbon from the atmosphere. Marine protected areas are critical to preserving biodiversity refuges.

Above all, we must shed the hubris that has permitted such desecration and recognize the oceans as indivisible from the planet's wellbeing – and our own. The seas do not exist in isolation; they are the circulatory system for the living Earth, and their demise will be our undoing as well.

For too long, we've perceived the ocean's vastness as inexhaustible, but this has been the ultimate delusion. We've wielded our technological ingenuity not as wise stewards but perpetual conquerors, subduing the seas at our own peril. Blinded by greed and entitlement, we've pushed the oceans to the precipice.

Achieving SDG 14 is no longer an academic exercise but a moral reckoning to heal what we've broken before it's too late. The path will be arduous, demanding profound shifts in values, economies, and power structures. Yet the oceans' resilience has not yet been extinguished; if we act now with urgency and resolve, their vibrant regenerative force can be unleashed.  

The choice is ours: Resuscitate the oceans from the depths of degradation, or witness their once-unimaginable demise and suffer the consequences of our myopic destruction. For the oceans are not only the cradle of life – they may also be our final mercy.
