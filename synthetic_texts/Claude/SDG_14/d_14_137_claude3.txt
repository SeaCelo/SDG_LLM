The Bitter Battle to Save Our Oceans

By Andrew Sullivan

The earth's oceans have nurtured life on this planet for billions of years, acting as the womb from which all life emerged and ultimately the source that sustains humanity itself. And yet, with our typical human hubris, we have pillaged and polluted these vast waters recklessly, pursing short-term economic gains at the long-term expense of the very ecosystem services that make human civilization possible. The oceans are under assault from human activity, their waters warming, chemistries transforming, biological codes being rewritten. No force on earth is more destructive than mankind when it comes to the marine environment.

Through overfishing, destructive fishing practices, pollution, and habitat degradation, we are dismantling the ocean's resilient yet finely balanced ecosystems piece by piece. Over a third of the world's fish stocks are now overfished, with many species hovering at precipitously low population levels. Particularly vulnerable are the apex predators, from the prehistoric sharks to the magnificent bluefin tuna, whose ranks have been decimated by humanity's rapacious appetites. Bottom trawling, where heavy nets are dragged across fragile seafloor habitats, has turned once vibrant seamounts and coral gardens into desolate plains. 

Nutrient run-off from agriculture and plastic waste have created corpse-laden "dead zones" bereft of oxygen and life across our once thriving coastal waters. Our insatiable thirst for fossil fuels has steadily raised sea surface temperatures and caused rapid acidification of the oceans, bleaching corals and destroying key nursery habitats for marine creatures across the planet. The profound scale of death in the sea is almost too vast to comprehend.

This epic of oceanic degradation and loss prompted the United Nations to sound the clarion call through Sustainable Development Goal 14: Life Below Water. The imperative is clear - we must act urgently and resolutely to "conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development." At stake is nothing less than the future of our oceans themselves and the priceless ecosystem services they provide to sustain life on earth.

If we are to succeed in this Sisyphean struggle, we must embrace a suite of bold reforms and interventions. We must impose enforceable science-based catch limits to end the scourge of overfishing and allow depleted fish stocks to rebuild. We must ban destructive fishing practices like bottom trawling to preserve delicate seafloor habitats. We must designate expansive marine protected areas, free from any industrial exploitation, to give the oceans room to heal and recover their biological richness.  

We must dramatically curb the flow of nutrient pollution, plastic waste, and chemicals into the marine environment from land-based sources. We must urgently transition away from fossil fuels to arrest the rising temperatures and acidification destroying critical marine ecosystems. In short, we as a civilization must fundamentally re-envision and transform our relationship with these priceless waters that quite literally give life to our planet.

Despite the existential magnitude of this challenge, one senses an almost willful societal blindness, a failure to truly appreciate the gravity of the oceanic crisis unfolding around us. Perhaps it is the sheer immensity of the seas that causes us to discount or psychologically deny their unraveling. Yet the signs are unmistakable for any who care to submerge their gaze - the oceans are ceasing to thrive and soon may cease to survive.  

If humanity is to endure as a species, we must answer this call to revive the oceans we have so carelessly defiled. The long, bitter battle to save the seas is one we dare not lose. For those who love the wild, tenacious beauty of the marine realm, this most consequential fight is only just beginning.
