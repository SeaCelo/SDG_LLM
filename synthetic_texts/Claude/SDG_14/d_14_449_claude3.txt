Tearfund's analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 14: Life Below Water

The world's oceans and marine ecosystems are under immense stress, facing an array of threats that jeopardize their resilience and sustainability. From the scourge of plastic pollution to the devastating impacts of climate change, the challenges confronting our aquatic environments are complex and multifaceted. As an organization deeply committed to environmental stewardship and social justice, Tearfund recognizes the critical importance of SDG 14 in safeguarding the delicate equilibrium of our oceans and seas.

The scale of marine pollution is staggering, with an estimated 8 million tons of plastic waste entering our oceans annually. This plastic debris not only poses a direct threat to marine life through ingestion and entanglement but also contributes to the formation of vast garbage patches that disrupt entire ecosystems. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a swirling vortex of plastic waste larger than the state of Texas, serves as a sobering reminder of the magnitude of this crisis. Tearfund's initiatives aim to address this issue through community-based education, advocacy for stronger regulations, and partnerships with local organizations to promote sustainable waste management practices.

Climate change, driven by human-induced greenhouse gas emissions, is another formidable challenge facing our oceans. Rising sea temperatures are causing widespread coral bleaching events, the loss of vital habitats for countless marine species. Additionally, ocean acidification, resulting from the absorption of excess carbon dioxide, is disrupting the delicate chemical balance necessary for shellfish and other calcifying organisms to form their shells and exoskeletons. Tearfund is actively engaged in promoting sustainable fishing practices, advocating for the protection of marine protected areas, and supporting coastal communities in their efforts to adapt to the impacts of climate change.

The depletion of fish stocks due to unsustainable fishing practices is a pressing concern that threatens not only marine biodiversity but also the livelihoods of millions who depend on fishing for their sustenance. Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, coupled with destructive fishing methods such as bottom trawling, have decimated entire fish populations, disrupting the intricate food web and exacerbating poverty in coastal communities. Tearfund collaborates with local partners to promote sustainable aquaculture, implement catch-share programs, and advocate for stronger enforcement of fishing regulations to combat IUU fishing.

Coastal ecosystems, including mangrove forests, seagrass beds, and coral reefs, play a vital role in sustaining marine biodiversity, protecting shorelines from erosion, and supporting the livelihoods of coastal communities. However, these ecosystems are under threat from urban development, pollution, and unsustainable resource extraction. Tearfund recognizes the importance of preserving and restoring these vital habitats, working with local communities to implement sustainable coastal zone management practices and promote eco-tourism initiatives that incentivize conservation efforts.

In addressing the challenges posed by SDG 14, Tearfund acknowledges the intrinsic link between the health of our oceans and the well-being of human populations, particularly those living in coastal regions and small island developing states. By fostering partnerships with local communities, governments, and other stakeholders, Tearfund is committed to promoting innovative solutions that balance environmental protection with sustainable economic development, ensuring that our oceans remain vibrant and productive for generations to come.
