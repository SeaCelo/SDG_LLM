Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is deeply concerned about the alarming state of the world's oceans and marine resources, as outlined in Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG 14): Life Below Water. Our field teams have witnessed firsthand the devastating impacts of unsustainable fishing practices, marine pollution, and climate change on coastal communities and ecosystems worldwide.

The relentless pursuit of profit by commercial fishing fleets has led to the widespread depletion of fish stocks, threatening the livelihoods and food security of millions who depend on marine resources. Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing continues to undermine conservation efforts, exacerbating the problem. Furthermore, the use of destructive fishing methods, such as bottom trawling and dynamite fishing, has caused irreparable damage to fragile marine habitats, including coral reefs and seagrass meadows.

Marine pollution, particularly from plastic waste and chemical contaminants, poses a severe threat to marine life and human health alike. Plastic debris entangles and suffocates countless marine creatures, while microplastics and toxic chemicals accumulate in the food chain, contaminating seafood and endangering the health of coastal communities. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a vast expanse of plastic debris spanning an area larger than France, serves as a sobering reminder of the scale of this crisis.

The impacts of climate change on the world's oceans are equally alarming. Rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification are wreaking havoc on marine ecosystems, causing coral bleaching and the disruption of delicate food webs. Sea-level rise, exacerbated by melting glaciers and ice caps, threatens to displace millions of people living in low-lying coastal regions and small island nations, potentially triggering mass migration and humanitarian crises.

MSF's teams have witnessed the devastating consequences of these interrelated issues firsthand. In the Philippines, for example, we have treated communities suffering from the effects of cyanide and dynamite fishing, which have destroyed coral reefs and decimated fish populations, jeopardizing their livelihoods and food security. In the Indian Ocean, we have provided medical assistance to communities affected by the catastrophic tsunami of 2004, which was exacerbated by the degradation of coastal ecosystems that could have served as natural buffers against such disasters.

Addressing these complex challenges requires a multi-faceted approach that involves international cooperation, policy reforms, and grassroots action. Effective monitoring and enforcement mechanisms must be implemented to combat IUU fishing and protect marine reserves. Collaborative efforts are needed to address plastic pollution at its source, promote sustainable waste management practices, and develop innovative solutions for plastic alternatives and recycling.

Furthermore, mitigating the impacts of climate change on the oceans demands a rapid transition to renewable energy sources and the implementation of robust carbon-capture technologies. Coastal communities must be empowered to adapt to the changing environmental conditions through capacity-building, infrastructure development, and the integration of traditional ecological knowledge.

MSF remains committed to advocating for the protection of marine ecosystems and the well-being of coastal communities worldwide. We call upon governments, international organizations, and civil society to prioritize SDG 14 and take decisive action to safeguard the health of our oceans for present and future generations. The time to act is now, before the consequences of inaction become irreversible.
