Here is a detailed academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 14 (Life Below Water), written from the perspective of Harold Meyerson:

The Oceans as the Frontline in Humanity's Struggle for a Livable Planet

The world's oceans have long been treated as a limitless resource to be exploited for short-term economic gain, with the catastrophic consequences of this plunder largely out of sight and out of mind for most of humanity. But as SDG 14 makes abundantly clear, our seas are choking on humanity's avarice and indifference. The oceans comprise 70% of the planet's surface and produce over half of the world's oxygen supply. Yet, human activity has imperiled this global commons through overfishing, pollution, acidification, and global warming.  

The statistics are as staggering as they are infuriating. Approximately 30% of the world's fish stocks are overexploited, with another 60% fished at maximum sustainable levels. Annually, 8 million tons of plastic trash - the modern-day equivalent of nuclear waste - enters the oceans, a great synthetic vortex killing millions upon millions of marine creatures. And the oceans have absorbed 30% of the carbon emissions produced by human industrial activity, causing acidification that destroys coral reefs and other vital ecosystems.

This unregulated desecration of our blue planet reveals the folly of seeing the environment as an externality, rather than the pre-condition for human survival itself. If present trends continue, by 2050 the oceans will contain more plastic than fish. Widespread loss of marine biodiversity will shatter the food chains on which billions of people depend. Rising sea levels will displace hundreds of millions from coastal regions. And collapsing phytoplankton biomass will deprive the atmosphere of one of its chief sources of oxygen renewal. 

The global elite's disregard for SDG 14 reflects their inability to see beyond the next investor report or quarterly earnings statement. They mistakenly believe the market's invisible hand will solve the existential challenges facing the world's oceans. But the cold reality is that short-term profits are being chosen over long-term ecological viability. A new environmentalism of the global commons is required.

This means treating the oceans not as a free resource to be strip-mined by corporations and industrial fleets, but as a public trust to be sustainably managed in the interests of all humanity. No corporation should be permitted to pillage the oceanic wealth that is the common heritage of all people. Public policy must reflect environmental values over commercial expediency. Marine protected areas must be vastly expanded, to allow depleted fish stocks to recover. Plastic waste streams need to be reengineered to achieve zero emissions into the oceans. And fossil fuel emissions causing ocean warming and acidification must be drastically curtailed through economic incentives for clean energy alternatives.

Beyond new regulations, we need a fundamental reorientation in how we perceive humans' relationship to the oceans. They are the earth's vital circulatory system, not an infinite waste pit for humanity's industrial effluence. Marine biodiversity is essential to our own long-term survival, not an impediment to corporate profitability. Saving the oceans means saving ourselves from ecological collapse and societal upheaval on an unprecedented scale.

Some may see such a reordering of priorities as economic doomsaying. But the real path to economic calamity lies in our current rapacious relationship with the oceans. Ecosystems regeneration, sustainable development, and resource preservation must be embraced as the new imperatives of mutually-reinforcing environmental and economic policies.  Before today's quarterly reports are rendered meaningless in the face of tomorrow's planetary ecocide, humanity must redefine prosperity not as the hollow rationale for despoiling the oceans, but as collective prosperity achieved in symbiotic balance with the world's precious marine environment. Our oceans, our future - the two are inextricably intertwined.
