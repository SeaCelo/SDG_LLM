Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 14 (Life Below Water) from the perspective of Richard Littlejohn:

Alright you lot of lily-livered, moist-eyed conservationists? Grab a kipper and settle in, because I'm about to take the mickey out of your precious little SDG 14 - "Life Below Water." 

Let's start with the basics. The United Nations has decreed that by 2030 we must "conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources." Well la-di-da! Since when did we need a bunch of bureaucratic busy-bodies from thesmug metropolitan elite to lecture us about respecting the oceans?

In case you haven't noticed, we Britons have a bit of history when it comes to life below water. We've been sailing the seven seas and harpooning whales since long before Eurocrats were a twinkle in Jacques Delors' eye. Just ask Nelson and his tarsiers!

Speaking of which, why do these SDG wallahs get so hot and bothered about reducing marine pollution and acidification? We've been chucking our unwanted domestics into the briny deep since time immemorial without the oceans batting so much as an eco-eyelid.

Then there's this preposterous goal about regulating harvesting, ending overfishing, and restoring fish stocks by 2020. Perhaps someone should explain the facts of life to these sandal wearers? The sea was put on this Earth for man to plunder as he pleases. If God hadn't intended us to over-exploit marine ecosystems, he wouldn't have made them so darned useful for fish and chips, now would he?

Don't even get me started on protecting at least 10 percent of coastal and marine areas. I'll tell you what - we can protect them all we like, just as soon as migrants stop turning our nation's seaside resorts into mock-seaside towns from the Third World with their smelly open-air fish markets!

Look, I've got nothing against the odd initiative to tackle sea-level rise or prohibit certain forms of fishing subsidies that contribute to overcapacity and overfishing, god-bless-em. But let's be reasonable here - there's no need to get in a lather about increasing scientific knowledge and developing research to aid conservation efforts.

At the end of the day, no amount of incomprehensible sciencey bafflegab from specialists will change a simple fact - the oceans were given to us to use and abuse as we saw fit, no questions asked. And anyone who says different is just a naive, do-gooding milksop.

Now, if you'll pardon me, I have a seal cull to organise. Chin chin!
