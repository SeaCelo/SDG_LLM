Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 14 (Life Below Water) as if written by environmental journalist Brendan O'Neill:

The Sustainable Development Goal of "Life Below Water" and the Misanthropic Values that Underpin It

By Brendan O'Neill

The UN's 14th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) -- to "conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources" -- sounds benign enough. Who could object to trying to keep the oceans healthy? But behind this seemingly innocuous goal lies a disturbing ideology that views humanity as a virus on the Earth and celebrates environmental policies that restrict our footprint and even our numbers.  

At its core, SDG 14 is just the latest expression of the anti-human outlook that motivates so much environmentalist thinking today. For the green misanthropes, the human race is a scourge, consuming too many resources and leaving too large an imprint on the natural world. Their barely concealed desire is for economic growth to be curbed, development to be stymied and our numbers to be controlled if not reduced, all in the name of "saving the planet." This is the elitist, anti-progress mentality that drives SDG 14's aims of preserving ocean "areas" from "adverse impacts" and zealously pursuing the "sustainable use" of marine life.

Of course, these UN bureaucrats and green fundamentalists couch their arguments in pragmatic terms, claiming we must be more judicious in harnessing the oceans' "resources" in order to preserve them for future generations. This feigns a democratic, future-oriented concern. But it is a ruse. What they really seek is to cordon off vast swathes of the seas, removing these from humanity's reach and authority in an act of anti-humanist territorial control. They want to leave the oceans "pristine" and "undisturbed" as some sort of aquatic wilderness checked by human incursion.

That their primary tool for achieving this is advocating for larger "marine protected areas" tells us all we need to know. These are arrogantly demarcated zones where human activity is severely restricted or even outright banned. It represents a modern reincarnation of those old aristocratic land enclosures that once removed land from the hands of the people, keeping humans away from nature's bounty for the benefit of a small elite.

Furthermore, consider the insidious agenda pushed through SDG 14's calls to combat "overfishing." Every shortage or stock decline is instantly blamed on "overfishing" rather than natural fluctuations in oceanic life cycles. It doesn't matter that our industrial fishing has fed billions – as soon as catch rates dip, the greens bray about "unsustainable exploitation." Their goal is clear: to cut back on the scale and range of our marine harvesting and to make fish less accessible and more pricey for the common person.

Indeed, peel back the layers and you'll discover that what animates SDG 14 and much of today's environmentalism is a fear of mass, modern society and a quasi-religious belief that we must constrain economic development and human aspirations in order to "live in harmony" with the planet. If their agenda were really about sustainability, they would embrace technological solutions to better extract and cultivate marine resources rather than restrict human endeavor. But they don't want us utilizing the seas more efficiently – they want us utilizing them less, period.

All of this fits with the underlying outlook of the UN and global organizations like the WWF when it comes to humanity's role on the Earth. Whether explicitly stated or not, they see us as a compromising force, gobbling up resources and spoiling habitats. Hence their obsession with curbing population growth, particularly in the developing world. Hence their myopic focus on maintaining "pristine" environments in which human activity is negligible. And hence their repeated insinuations that we are despoiling the planet and must rein in our footprint for nature's sake.  

With SDG 14, this eco-inhuman outlook has been turbo-charged to cover the vast marine realm. The goal indulges the green elite's obsession with preventing us from having too expansive a presence on the oceans. Its targets related to protected areas and reducing overfishing reveal a darker desire to remove large bodies of water from our jurisdiction and consumption. Worse, the push against marine pollution represents an implicit criticism of modern industrial development itself – which always comes with environmental impacts that mankind should harness science to mitigate, not curtail economic progress altogether.

Beware the SDGs and the twisted, regressive misanthropy that animates their aims. Goals like SDG 14 are at best a form of green psychodrama, remaking the environment into an amusement park playground for environmentalists to micromanage. At worst, they represent a pre-modern rejection of human advancement dressed up in technocratic language. A reminder that for all their proclaimed concerns about the future, many of today's eco-activists want to chain humanity to nature in a way that restrains our potential and stunts societal development. Their quasi-religious reverence for the purity of nature knows no bounds -- including the vast marine wilderness. We should reject their stunting, mollifying agenda.
