The ocean's role in sustaining life on Earth is indisputable, and its preservation is paramount to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As a leading humanitarian organization, Catholic Relief Services (CRS) recognizes the intrinsic link between marine ecosystems and human well-being, particularly for coastal communities in developing countries.

The world's oceans are under unprecedented stress from a multitude of anthropogenic pressures, including overfishing, pollution, habitat destruction, and climate change. These threats have far-reaching consequences, not only for marine biodiversity but also for the livelihoods, food security, and overall resilience of vulnerable populations.

SDG 14, "Life Below Water," serves as a rallying call to address these challenges and promote the sustainable use and conservation of the world's oceans, seas, and marine resources. CRS, with its extensive on-the-ground presence and commitment to holistic development, is well-positioned to play a pivotal role in advancing this goal.

Through our integrated approach, we are working to strengthen the resilience of coastal communities by promoting sustainable fisheries management, combating marine pollution, and supporting the restoration of critical habitats such as mangrove forests and coral reefs. These efforts not only safeguard marine ecosystems but also provide alternative livelihood opportunities, enhance food security, and mitigate the impacts of climate change and natural disasters.

One of the key challenges we face is the prevalence of illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, which depletes fish stocks, undermines sustainable management efforts, and perpetuates a cycle of poverty and resource depletion. In response, CRS is collaborating with local communities, governments, and international organizations to implement robust monitoring, control, and surveillance systems, as well as to promote responsible fishing practices and market-based incentives for sustainable seafood.

Moreover, marine pollution, particularly from plastic waste and land-based sources, poses a significant threat to marine life and human health. CRS is actively engaging in community-led initiatives to reduce plastic waste, improve waste management infrastructure, and raise awareness about the environmental and socio-economic impacts of marine pollution.

Climate change is another pressing issue that exacerbates the challenges faced by coastal communities. Rising sea levels, ocean acidification, and extreme weather events are disrupting marine ecosystems and threatening the livelihoods of those who depend on them. CRS is working to enhance the adaptive capacity of these communities through ecosystem-based adaptation strategies, such as restoring and protecting coastal habitats like mangrove forests, which serve as natural barriers against storm surges and sea-level rise.

Furthermore, we recognize the importance of incorporating traditional ecological knowledge and engaging local communities in decision-making processes. By fostering inclusive and participatory approaches, we ensure that our interventions are culturally appropriate, locally relevant, and sustainable in the long term.

SDG 14 represents a call to action for all stakeholders to collaborate and take decisive steps towards conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas, and marine resources. At CRS, we are committed to leveraging our expertise, partnerships, and on-the-ground presence to contribute to this global effort, ensuring that the benefits of healthy and resilient marine ecosystems are realized for generations to come.
