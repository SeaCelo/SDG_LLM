The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14, "Life Below Water," is a critical area of focus for the International Labour Organization (ILO) as it addresses the inextricable link between the health of marine ecosystems and the livelihoods of millions of workers worldwide. The ocean economy, which encompasses a wide range of economic activities such as fishing, aquaculture, tourism, and maritime transportation, is a significant contributor to global employment and economic growth. However, unsustainable practices and overexploitation of marine resources pose severe threats to the long-term viability of these industries and the well-being of those who depend on them.

The ILO recognizes that achieving SDG 14 is not only an environmental imperative but also a matter of social justice and decent work. Coastal communities, small-scale fishers, and seafarers are among the most vulnerable groups affected by the degradation of marine environments. Overfishing, illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing practices, and habitat destruction threaten the sustainability of fish stocks, ultimately jeopardizing the livelihoods of millions of workers engaged in the fishing industry.

Moreover, the impact of climate change and ocean acidification on marine ecosystems has far-reaching implications for the global workforce. Rising sea levels and extreme weather events pose significant risks to coastal infrastructure, disrupting maritime operations and endangering the safety and well-being of seafarers and port workers. The loss of coral reefs and mangrove forests, which serve as natural barriers against storms and erosion, exacerbates these risks and undermines the resilience of coastal communities.

To address these challenges, the ILO promotes a comprehensive and integrated approach that encompasses policy interventions, capacity building, and the promotion of sustainable practices across the ocean economy. Collaboration with international organizations, governments, and social partners is essential to fostering a just transition towards sustainable ocean-based industries.

One key area of focus for the ILO is the promotion of decent work in the fishing sector. This involves addressing issues such as forced labour, human trafficking, and poor working conditions that are prevalent in many fisheries, particularly in the context of IUU fishing operations. The ILO's Work in Fishing Convention (No. 188) and its accompanying Recommendation (No. 199) provide a comprehensive framework for ensuring decent working conditions, safety, and social protection for fishers.

Furthermore, the ILO recognizes the importance of empowering and supporting small-scale fishers and coastal communities, who are disproportionately affected by the impacts of overfishing and environmental degradation. Initiatives focused on capacity building, access to resources, and sustainable livelihood opportunities are crucial for enhancing the resilience of these communities and promoting their economic and social well-being.

In the context of climate change adaptation, the ILO advocates for the development of green jobs and the diversification of livelihoods in coastal regions. This includes promoting sustainable tourism, aquaculture, and renewable energy projects that generate employment opportunities while minimizing environmental impacts. Additionally, the ILO emphasizes the importance of investing in climate-resilient infrastructure, such as coastal defenses and sustainable port facilities, to protect workers and ensure the continuity of maritime operations.

Collaboration with international organizations, such as the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), is essential for addressing the complex challenges facing marine ecosystems and the ocean economy. The ILO contributes its expertise in labour standards, social dialogue, and decent work to these partnerships, ensuring that the rights and well-being of workers are at the forefront of efforts to achieve SDG 14.

In conclusion, the ILO's commitment to SDG 14 reflects its recognition that the health of marine ecosystems and the sustainability of ocean-based industries are intrinsically linked to the well-being of workers and their communities. By promoting decent work, sustainable practices, and a just transition towards a blue economy, the ILO plays a crucial role in ensuring that the benefits of marine resources are equitably shared and that the livelihoods of those who depend on the ocean are safeguarded for generations to come.
