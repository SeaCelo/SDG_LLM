In this analytical report, the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID) focuses on Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG 14): "Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development." Oceans play a crucial role in regulating the climate, producing oxygen, and absorbing carbon dioxide, as well as harboring invaluable marine biodiversity. However, human activities such as pollution, overexploitation of fish stocks, ocean acidification, and climate change are placing unprecedented pressure on these marine ecosystems.

One of the greatest challenges we face is the increasing problem of marine pollution, particularly from plastics. According to recent reports, an estimated 4 to 12 million tons of plastic waste enter the marine environment annually, posing a severe threat to marine life and food webs. AECID has been working with partner countries to develop policies and strategies to reduce plastic pollution, promoting a circular economy and recycling, as well as educating and raising awareness in society about this critical issue.

Another crucial aspect is the sustainable management of fisheries, a primary source of protein for millions of people worldwide. Unfortunately, overfishing and destructive fishing practices have led to the decline of fish populations in many regions. AECID has closely collaborated with international organizations and local governments to implement fisheries management plans based on scientific data, promote sustainable artisanal fishing, and combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing.

In addition, ocean acidification, caused by rising atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, is having a devastating impact on marine ecosystems, particularly coral reefs and calcifying species. AECID has supported research and projects to monitor and mitigate the effects of acidification, as well as promote the resilience of coastal communities to these changes.

It is also worth noting that the impacts of climate change, such as rising sea levels, coastal erosion, and extreme weather events, pose additional threats to coastal zones and communities dependent on marine resources. AECID has been working to implement adaptation and mitigation measures for climate change, promoting the conservation of coastal and marine ecosystems such as mangroves and coral reefs, which play a crucial role in protecting against climate impacts.

Achieving SDG 14 requires an integrated and multidisciplinary approach involving a diverse range of stakeholders, from governments to local communities, non-governmental organizations, and the private sector. AECID has promoted regional and international cooperation, knowledge sharing, and technology transfer to address these challenges effectively.

In summary, this analytical report highlights AECID's and its partners' efforts to conserve and sustainably use oceans, seas, and marine resources by tackling critical challenges such as marine pollution, overfishing, ocean acidification, and climate change impacts. Through a multidimensional and collaborative approach, AECID aims to contribute to achieving SDG 14 and ensuring the health and resilience of our oceans for present and future generations.
