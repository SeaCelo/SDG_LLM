Here is a draft academic article about SDG 14 (Life Below Water) in the voice of advice columnist Carolyn Hax:

Our Oceans Are Crying Out For Help, We Must Listen

It pains me to say this, but we humans are behaving in a way toward our planet's oceans that would be unacceptable in any relationship—be it with a romantic partner, a friend, or even an acquaintance. We are taking the oceans for granted, overexploiting their resources without care for the consequences, polluting them with abandon, and fundamentally disrespecting their wellbeing. It's a toxic dynamic, one that cannot be sustained.

Our oceans cover over 70% of the planet's surface and contain 97% of the world's water. They produce over half of the oxygen in the atmosphere and absorb the most carbon from it. In other words, they are the life support system for our "pale blue dot," as the poet so eloquently put it. Yet we treat them with such carelessness, such neglect, that if the oceans could speak they would be gasping for mercy.  

Let me lay out just some of the ways we are mistreating the oceans to make my point:

We have taken their fish stocks to the brink of collapse through overfishing, with 90% of stocks now fully exploited or overexploited. That aggressive plundering accelerates even as we better understand the irreplaceable role of marine biodiversity.

We have destroyed vital ocean habitats like coral reefs, mangroves, and seagrass beds through pollution, coastal development, and the effects of greenhouse gas emissions. One day future generations may only see their beauty in documentaries and museums.

Speaking of pollution, each year we dump millions of tons of plastics, chemicals, and other contaminants directly into ocean waters. This literally chokes marine life and alters entire ecosystems in disastrous ways.  

The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change is causing sea levels to rise at alarming rates, increasing ocean temperatures, and amplifying the destructive power of storms—all of which threaten coastal communities worldwide.

I could go on, but I think I've made my point. We are taking the oceans for granted in unsustainable, unethical ways. This destructive relationship belies their vital importance to all life on Earth and imperils the future of humanity itself if left unchecked.

Now, I'm not naive. Changing human behaviors and systems that have been entrenched for generations is incredibly difficult. There are powerful forces and interests invested in the status quo exploitation of marine resources for economic gain.

But we must find a way. For the sake of our oceans, our planet, our children and grandchildren, we have to demonstrate the courage to evolve, to build a new, sustainable relationship with the oceans defined by protection, restoration, and nurturing rather than pillaging. The solution lies in a holistic embrace of the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 14: "Life Below Water."

SDG 14 is a comprehensive roadmap for tackling the multi-faceted challenges of ocean degradation and overuse. Its targets cover everything from minimizing pollution, restoring fish stocks, reducing ocean acidification, regulating exploitation, increasing marine protected areas, ending harmful fishery subsidies, and giving greater access to marine resources for small-scale fisheries—especially in developing nations.

In other words, SDG 14 demands that we as a global community take critical action across all the drivers of ocean degradation. Its targets must be aggressively pursued and achieved. Because the alternative—further decimating Earth's already stressed marine ecosystems—is unacceptable if we wish to avoid an ecological collapse that would reverberate catastrophically through all life systems.

I realize the scale of SDG 14's ambition can feel overwhelming. But we each can play a role in this vital mission, no matter how small it may seem. We can change our own consumer behaviors—reducing plastic use, making sustainable seafood choices, and lowering our carbon footprint. We can support leaders and policies devoted to marine conservation. We can educate those around us. Every positive action helps.

Most of all, we need a profound shift in humanity's relationship with the oceans. We must go from being selfish takers to responsible stewards who respect and revere their importance. The oceans have given us life—now we must give them a chance to not just survive, but thrive.

Our grandchildren and their grandchildren are counting on us. We mustn't fail them when the oceans are crying out for our help and care. This is an intervention that simply cannot wait another day.
