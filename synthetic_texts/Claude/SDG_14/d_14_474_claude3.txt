Conserving Our Oceanic Treasures: SDG 14 and Latin America's Blue Economy 

By Latin Trade

The marine realms that embrace Latin America and the Caribbean are ecological marvels, economic engines, and cultural wellsprings. From the turquoise splendor of the Caribbean Sea to the fecund waters of the Pacific, our region boasts a disproportionately rich share of the world's ocean resources and biodiversity. Yet this extraordinary blue patrimony faces existential perils—overfishing, pollution, acidification, habitat loss, and others—that jeopardize its vitality and sustainability. Recognizing this grave challenge, the United Nations included SDG 14 (Life Below Water) in its 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, rallying a global response to better steward and preserve our indispensable marine environments.

Few regions have more at stake in this crusade than Latin America and the Caribbean. With sovereignty over 38% of the world's coastal areas and 14% of its marine territories, our nations are custodians to truly vast oceanic domains. This azure endowment fuels vibrant fishing, tourism, shipping, energy, and other maritime industries that generate an estimated $408 billion annually—about 5.4% of the region's GDP. Moreover, globally traded fisheries products from the region were valued at nearly $20 billion in 2018.  

Yet Latin America's seas, gulfs, bays, and territorial waters face daunting pressures that jeopardize their health and productivity. According to the U.N., over 60% of fish stocks are overexploited—a dire statistic for nations like Peru and Chile, the world's second- and eighth-largest fishing nations, respectively. Plastic pollution afflicts coastlines from Mexico's Caribbean gems to Brazil's untrammeled Northeast. Coral reefs, key bulwarks against erosion and storm surges, are bleaching and degrading across the Caribbean basin.

Driving home the urgency, the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a 7.7% contraction in Latin America's ocean-based economy in 2020, according to the OECD. Embattled maritime sectors shed jobs across tourism, shipping, fishing, and more. In short, the crisis spotlighted the imperative of recalibrating our historic maritime strategies onto a more sustainable trajectory.

Which makes the SDG 14 framework—with its multipronged targets on curtailing marine pollution, restoring depleted fish populations and ecosystems, regulating extraction, and expanding marine protected areas—so vital for the region's future prosperity and ecological inheritance. 

A growing cohort of Latin American nations have catalyzed efforts aligned with SDG 14's benchmarks. Consider Mexico's laudable endeavor to expand fish farms and resuscitate mangrove forests defending its Caribbean coastlines. Further south, Colombia has established numerous marine protected areas while enhancing sewage treatment to reduce ocean contamination. Nations like Chile, Costa Rica, and Ecuador are cultivating sustainable aquaculture industries—a crucial strategy as wild capture fisheries wane globally. And in a major achievement for SDG 14, the revised Nauru Agreement (implemented by eight Pacific Island nations including Ecuador) seeks to sustainably co-manage migratory tuna stocks undergirding a $5 billion industry.

On a regional scale, groups like the U.N.'s Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) have embraced SDG 14 as a focal priority. ECLAC's holistic Sustainable Ocean Economy Framework charts a judicious balance of economic growth and conservation spanning fisheries management, coastal tourism, maritime shipping, port infrastructure, and marine biodiversity safeguards. Such bold, integrated strategies will be indispensable to nurture our oceanic assets and the countless livelihoods, industries, and communities intertwined with their vitality.

Yet there remains much unfinished work ahead. Too many ocean habitats and fish stocks remain dangerously compromised. Insufficient scientific monitoring, slack regulations, and illegal activity still allow unchecked plundering. And the unavoidable threats of climate change—sea level rise, warming temperatures, acidification—will only intensify existing perils if left unmitigated.   

Multilateral coordination and aggressive financing to bolster SDG 14-oriented policies and protections are essential. Regional development banks must ramp up funding for projects conserving marine environments and blue economies. Nations should double down on expanding marine protected areas and modernized, science-driven fishing quotas. Sustainable ocean industries like eco-tourism and renewable ocean energy deserve robust incentives to mature into economic centerpieces and job creators.

For Latin America and the Caribbean, realizing the transformative vision of SDG 14 is more than an environmental cause; it is an economic and cultural imperative. Our region's identities and prospects are indelibly tied to the azure arteries enveloping our shores. Whether succulent ceviche, pristine Caribbean dive sites, the incalculable coastal heritage, or novel marine biotechnologies, our oceanic bounty nourishes us materially and spiritually. SDG 14 provides an indispensable blueprint to revitalize and perpetuate that enduring wellspring.
