Here is a draft academic article about SDG 14 (Life Below Water) from the perspective of renowned economist Janet Currie:

Ensuring the sustainable use of marine resources is not only an environmental imperative, but an economic one with profound implications for human health and productivity. As an economist, I am compelled to examine the sustainable management of oceans through the lens of market failures, externalities, and the inextricable links between environmental degradation and diminished human capital development.

The world's oceans play an outsized role in regulating the biosphere and climate systems that shape the human environment. However, rampant overfishing, pollution, habitat destruction, and acidification from carbon emissions represent a catastrophic market failure where private interests are decimating a shared global commons. Gordon's insights on the Tragedy of the Commons illustrate how open-access resources are relentlessly exploited to the point of depletion unless strong governance mechanisms are enacted.  

The marine fisheries sector offers a stark case study, with an estimated 33% of commercial fish stocks currently overexploited and 60% fully exploited. This reflects a dynamic inefficiency where short-run profit incentives drive overfishing and deplete the productive capital stock, paradoxically diminishing long-run returns and undermining the resource base. Enacting sustainable catch limits aligned with replenishment rates represents a colossal coordination challenge given marine regions transcend national jurisdictions and fishing entities range from industrial fleets to subsistence artisanal operations. But the forgone economic value from depleted fisheries is staggering - world bank estimates suggest capture fisheries losses of $50 billion annually from unsustainable practices.

Looking beyond depleted fish stocks, plastic waste streams flowing unchecked into marine environments spotlight another egregious externality imposed on the global commons. Over 8 million tons of plastic enters oceans annually, coalescing into massive garbage patches scattered across the high seas and shorelines. This effluence not only despoils habitats and ecosystems, but becomes metabolized in the marine food chain when microplastics are ingested by marine life, with still unknown impacts on food safety and human health. The costs of this unpriced externality on tourism revenue, fisheries productivity, and human well-being likely reach well into the billions.

Coastal and island communities bear the brunt of these ecological shocks, with sea level rise, acidification, and intensifying storm systems compounding the threats. For these populations, life below water is not only a source of economic livelihood but the linchpin of their cultures and diets. Disruptions to subsistence fishing practices and loss of access to marine protein sources can exacerbate malnutrition and poverty traps, with disastrous spillovers on health and human capital formation that perpetuate intergenerational deprivation.  

Affluent nations have a moral imperative and economic self-interest in supporting sustainable ocean management policies globally. Aside from the direct economic costs of depleted fisheries and biodiversity losses, unsustainable ocean practices abroad can spur mass migratory events as coastal communities are displaced by rising sea levels and resource depletion. By some estimates, sea level rise alone could displace up to 187 million people in the developing world by 2100, exacerbating refugee crises in the developed world and disrupting economic activity.

Furthermore, deteriorating ocean health jeopardizes biopharmaceutical discovery efforts, with the vast diversity of marine life representing a potentially lucrative frontier for novel drug development. It is estimated that marine organisms may yield compounds to treat up to 90% of viral diseases. Allowing rampant degradation would squander these innovation opportunities and diminish the option value of marine biodiversity as a source of solutions to future health challenges.

The complexity of managing the high seas and marine regions that transcend national boundaries necessitates coordinated global governance regimes. But the prospect of governing the global commons has been plagued by free-rider problems and weak enforcement. Recent efforts like the UN's first legally binding treaty on high seas biodiversity offer some promise, as do initiatives like the Global Ocean Accounts Partnership aimed at standardizing natural capital accounting frameworks. But ultimately, sustainable management rests on addressing the externality pricing failures and establishing clear property rights and incentive structures.

Mechanisms like catch shares that devolve transferrable fishing quotas can realign incentives for conservation. Marine protected areas and spatial closures can allow depleted stocks to recover and boost ecological resilience. And regulatory frameworks imposing financial penalties for environmental violations or conversely, creating markets for buying and selling pollution credits can help internalize externalities.

Implementing these policies globally requires a multilateral commitment to ocean sustainability backed by targeted development assistance for constructing governing institutions and regulatory frameworks in developing regions. After all, the oceans are an open access resource where the marginal damage inflicted by any individual actor is diffused across the entire global community. Only through a concerted, planetary-scale cooperation to protect life below water can we begin to resolve this market failure of titanic economic proportions. The stakes for human welfare could not be higher.
