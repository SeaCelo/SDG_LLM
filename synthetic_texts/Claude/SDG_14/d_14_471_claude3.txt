Here is a draft newspaper article about SDG 14 (Life Below Water) as if written for Forbes magazine:

A Rising Tide Lifts All Boats: Why Protecting Our Oceans is a Boon for Business

By the Forbes Editorial Board

The world's oceans are the lifeblood of our planet and a cornerstone of the global economy, generating trillions in revenue each year. However, this vast aquatic engine is being throttled by humanity's disregard for marine environments. Overfishing, pollution, habitat destruction, and climate change are throwing delicate ocean ecosystems out of kilter at an alarming rate. Unless we chart a new course, the consequences for coastal communities, marine industries, and the international economy could be staggering.  

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG 14) "Life Below Water" provides a navigational map for public and private sectors to work collaboratively to reverse the declining health of our oceans. The economic impetus for protecting and restoring marine ecosystems has never been more compelling. Globally, the ocean economy accounts for $1.5 trillion in value-added to the overall world economy. In the U.S. alone, ocean-based industries like tourism, recreation, shipping, and fishing contribute over $300 billion to GDP annually.

But these numbers are merely the tip of a very deep blue iceberg. Healthy oceans are the unseen utilities that power our way of life. They produce over half of the world's oxygen and absorb 30% of carbon dioxide emissions. Marine plants are a promising source of lifesaving drugs to combat cancer, arthritis, and viruses. Ocean currents redistribute heat and drive weather patterns. Coastal wetlands are essential storm buffers that protect shoreline communities from devastation during hurricanes, floods, and tsunamis.  

Indeed, the ocean is an economic force without equal. Yet companies in nearly every sector are inadvertently jeopardizing their own long-term interests by externalizing environmental costs in pursuit of short-term profits. Trillions have been squandered in the form of depleted fisheries, degraded ecosystems, and lost biodiversity and ecosystem services.

Enlightened self-interest should compel leaders across all industries to get ahead of this calamity. Those that take concrete actions now to cut emissions, transition to a circular economy, invest in marine conservation and sustainable fisheries, and mitigate the ecological impacts of development will build a critical business resiliency. Those that don't will be at the mercy of rising tides â€“ literally and metaphorically.

There are promising signs that some corporations are already boldly navigating toward environmental responsibility as a sustainable growth strategy. The judicious firms that make this pivot stand to gain first-mover advantages as the world transitions to the blue economy of tomorrow.

Pioneering companies like Parley for the Oceans, a collaborative network of brands, institutions, athletes and activists, are demonstrating how to reimagine and redesign manufacturing processes to upcycle marine plastic pollution into high-performance product lines. Their limited-edition athletic shoe woven from reclaimed ocean plastic sold out immediately and demonstrated there is pent-up consumer demand for products that transform ecological problems into innovative solutions.

Other multinationals like Carnival Corporation and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. are taking major strides to sharply curb emissions, wastewater discharge, and other pollutants from their ships to restore the pristine waters, reefs and beaches their businesses depend upon. Their efforts are emblematic of an enlightened corporate ethos: you cannot take more from the environment indefinitely without eventually undermining your own prosperity.

Responsible ocean stewardship isn't just about feel-good PR and tokenistic philanthropic efforts. It's about hardheaded risk management and securing the viability of entire business models and supply chains. Corporations that treat SDG 14 as a nuisance cost, rather than a strategic investment in continued access to vital natural capital and ecosystem services, are in for a rude and costly awakening as the ripple effects of marine degradation impact the global economy in myriad unanticipated ways.

The bottom line: Transitioning to a sustainable blue economy is not only ethically imperative, but it's also pragmatic capitalistic self-preservation. Corporations that don't embrace SDG 14 as a core business priority risk becoming victims of the next wave of disruption that will wipe out old industrial practices with the devastating force of an economic tsunami.
