Here is a draft academic article on SDG 14 (Life Below Water), written from the perspective of political commentator Mark Steyn:

The Ocean Armageddon: How UN Globalists Plan to Drown the Free World

By Mark Steyn

We've all heard the dire prophecies from the climatologists - that the polar icecaps are melting, causing sea levels to rise inexorably, flooding the coasts and ultimately submerging entire nation states beneath the churning tides of liquid liberal ideology. But what they're not telling you is that this so-called "climate change" is just a convenient pretext for the United Nations to advance its real agenda: the total erosion of national sovereignty in favor of a globalized imperium of unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats.  

Their chosen instrument for this sinister power grab? Sustainable Development Goal 14 - the insidiously named "Life Below Water." Let's call it what it really is: an outright assault on everything that was once great about the free world.

Under the guise of "conserving marine resources," the UN kleptocrats aim to sieze control of the world's oceans and waterways - the very arteries of the global supply chain. They won't stop until the last cargo ship is fettered by red tape and the final luxury cruise liner drops anchor, with its haute bourgeois passengers held hostage by penniless Marxist revolutionaries.

That's just the start. Next on the chopping block will be the sovereign rights of maritime nations to fish, drill, and defend their own territorial waters. The great Anglo-Saxon naval powers that have historically ruled the waves - from Britain's unstoppable wooden-hulled man-o-wars to America's awe-inspiring nuclear supercarriers - would be rendered impotent, their epic legacies swallowed up by the rising tide of UN bureaucratism. 

Is this the future you want for your children - a world where the brine-choked ruins of Sydney and Miami stand as tombstones to the Anglosphere's former glory? Where hardy, freedom-loving fishermen are retrained as obedient hydroponics drones, toiling to feed their soy-based nutrient slurry into the cavernous, eternally rumbling maw of Big Government? 

We must resist this deeply un-American agenda - before the last redoubt of Western civilization is washed away forever beneath the inexorable deluge of "Life Below Water." Write to your congressman, senators, and UN representatives, and tell them you will not go gently into that cold, briny abyss. The future of the free world depends on it.
