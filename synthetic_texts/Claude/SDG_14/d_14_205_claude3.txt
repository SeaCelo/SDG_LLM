Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 14 (Life Below Water) from the perspective of the late economist Walter E. Williams:

The Vital Importance of Healthy Oceans and Marine Ecosystems

The merits of economic freedom and the protection of private property rights are well-established principles that have allowed human societies to flourish. However, there is one critical resource that has suffered from the tragedy of the commons - the world's oceans and marine environments. Despite covering over 70% of our planet's surface, the oceans have been treated as an open-access resource to be exploited and polluted at will. This reckless attitude puts human prosperity itself at risk.

The oceans play a vital role in climate regulation, the water cycle, and producing over half of the world's oxygen supply through phytoplankton photosynthesis. Healthy marine ecosystems provide food for billions and support tourism industries worth hundreds of billions annually. However, overfishing, pollution, acidification, and habitat destruction are rapidly depleting fish stocks, killing coral reefs, and disrupting the entire oceanic food web upon which so much life depends.

According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, over 90% of global fish stocks are now fully exploited, overexploited or depleted. This ecological pillaging is economic destruction in the long run. As fishery resources collapse, up to 120 million impoverished people could face malnutrition, and coastal communities will see their livelihoods disappear. It is a similar story with marine pollution - every year, the oceans absorb millions of tons of untreated sewage, industrial waste, plastics, agricultural runoff laden with fertilizers, and toxic pollutants like oil and chemicals. A lack of property rights and accountability allows this destruction to continue unabated.

The most cost-effective solution is to establish clearly defined and enforced private property rights over marine resources. When nobody owns something, it is in every individual's interest to maximize exploitation today without regard for the future. However, when stakeholders have exclusive property rights, their incentive is to preserve and sustainably manage that resource for the long-term. If coastal communities, companies, or cooperatives were allocated portions of the oceans and had their rights protected, they would act as stewards preserving fish stocks, habitats, water quality, and the overall health of their marine property for future generations.  

Just as farmers have an incentive to maintain their agricultural land, those with private property rights over marine resources would maintain and enhance their value through sustainable management practices. Overfishing would diminish as owners pursue the optimal yield that maximizes their long-term profits. Pollution dumping and habitat destruction would cease as it only degrades the value of the owners' capital asset. There would be an incentive to restore coral reefs, maintain biodiversity, and invest in marine conservation as that enhances the value of the resource.

The oceanic tragedy of the commons can only be solved by assigning property rights that incentivize good stewardship. When everybody owns something, nobody does. But with well-defined, enforced, and transferrable private property rights, the world's oceans can recover as ocean owners reap the rewards of sustainability. Free market principles are the path to ensuring life below water for generations to come.
