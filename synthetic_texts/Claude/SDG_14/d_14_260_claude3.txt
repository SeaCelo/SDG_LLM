Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 14 (Life Below Water) as if written by Nobel Laureate economist Angus Deaton:

Achieving the Sustainable Development Goal of conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development represents one of the great challenges facing humanity in the 21st century. The marine environment plays a vital role in global food security and human health, and is an indispensable part of the biosphere. Yet the world's oceans are facing unprecedented threats from overfishing, pollution, acidification and warming temperatures induced by climate change.  

From an economic perspective, marine fisheries directly provide employment and income to millions globally, while contributing nutritious food to billions more. Fish provide more than 3 billion people with 20 percent of their intake of animal protein. Consumption of fish correlates strongly with income, rising rapidly as poverty falls - suggesting marine resources could be pivotal for advancing nutrition in developing countries. But rampant unsustainable practices have brought many global fish stocks perilously close to collapse.  

The UN Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that nearly 90% of marine fish stocks are now fully exploited or overfished, jeopardizing their ability to produce maximum sustainable yields. This is a direct outgrowth of deep economic inefficiency, with the pursuit of private profitable fishing leading to the depletion of the common marine resource. Politicians have lacked the will or ability to curtail overfishing through regulation and prevention of illegal unregulated fishing, while harmful subsidies promoting excessive capacity remain entrenched.  

The annual economic loss from unsustainable marine fishing practices is estimated at $50 billion globally in foregone revenue. More difficult to quantify are the long-term economic dangers from potential large-scale depletion of a crucially important source of nutrition and livelihood for billions. Marine ecosystems damaged by overfishing and pollution lose resilience and productivity over time, undermining future prospects for recovery.

Oceans also play a vital role in climate regulation and the carbon cycle, providing a carbon sink that has absorbed around 30% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. But rising CO2 levels are increasing ocean temperatures and acidification, which damages marine life that forms the basis of the food web.

Addressing the multifaceted threats to achieving SDG 14 will require sweeping policy action coordinated globally. Immediate priorities must include ending subsidies that promote overcapacity, while investing heavily in monitoring and enforcement against illegal and unregulated fishing. Marine reserves must expand to protect critical habitat and breeding areas. More fundamentally, economic incentives for sustainable fishing management must be developed, by basing policies on maximizing the present value of the marine asset stock rather than maximizing current returns. User rights and charges for access to fisheries can help create appropriate incentives.

The scale of the challenge is daunting - no global issue highlights more vividly the conflict between immediate economic incentives and long-term societal wellbeing. But the immense economic and human value at stake demands that SDG 14 must be addressed with the utmost urgency and resolve. The oceans are indispensable to human life and prosperity, and sacrificing marine resources on the altar of short-term profit could ultimately undermine development itself. The economic repercussions of depleted and degraded marine ecosystems would be catastrophic and felt for generations.
