Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 14: Life Below Water, written from the perspective of the late British writer and critic A.A. Gill:

The Damp Squib of SDG 14: How the Oceans Are Royally Screwed

By A.A. Gill

The seas have always frightened humanity. The dark, churning depths conceal monstrosities and terrors, embodying our most primal thalassophobic anxieties. But these days, the greatest threat lurking beneath the waves isn't some mythical Kraken - it's ourselves and our rapacious despoilation of the marine environment. 

The 14th Sustainable Development Goal, titled "Life Below Water," represents a well-meaning but ultimately doomed effort by the the global cognitariat to preserve and protect the oceans through a series of pious targets and indicators. Like the other SDGs, it reeks of self-congratulation and delusion - the psychoemotional equivalent of patting oneself on the back for a job well-not-done.

Consider Target 14.1, which calls for preventing and reducing marine pollution "of all kinds." How onanistically ambitious! Bon chance with that, mes amis. Plastic waste alone threatens to envelop the marine ecosystem in a swath of synthetic detritus from the Sargasso Sea to the goddamn Marianas Trench. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is just the luridly photogenic tip of peeking above the waves; below the surface lies an entire anthropogenic strata intermingling with sediment and marine snow.

More audacious still is Target 14.2, which demands the "sustainable management and protection of marine and coastal ecosystems" by 2020. That's a hilarious,if characteristically optimistic, fiction. We are witnessing entire ecosystems succumb to massive bleaching events as the oceans rapidly acidify and warm. Corals are perishing, mangrove forests are vanishing, and polar regions are liquefying in situ before our uncomprehending eyes. Mother Nature's marine marvels are being unmade one degree Celsius at a time. Quel tragique.

The list rolls on in a symphony of wishful thinking untethered from reality. Ending overfishing (14.4)? Ha! Until the human apelike hunger is sated, Poseidon's flocks will remain cruelly culled. Increasing marine reserves (14.5)? A thimbleful of protected areas amidst a toxic sea. Scientific knowledge, small-island developing states, maritime tenure rights - all worthy platitudes concealing Brobdingnagian threats.

When the histories are writ, SDG 14 will be seen as Exhibit A for the arrogant folly and self-delusion of the enlightenment conceit. We deluded ourselves that mere bureaucracy and paper targets could arrest the destructive forces of capitalism, industrialization, and vapid consumerism. This smug faith in technocratic solutions permitted us to continue ravaging the planetary estate as we documented its ruination in agonizing detail. The oceans are suffering a sci-fi body horror inflicted by the supposed custodians tasked with their safekeeping.

So fill your boots, you rapacious ocean-killers. Keep churning the waves into a cetacean cemetery and an anoxic Dead Zone. Have your tawdry beach holidays and tinned tuna mayonnaise sandwiches. Soon enough, the seas will be unrecognizable - bereft of life, color, and the fragile majesty that sparked mankind's primordial awe and terror. The Kraken has been supplanted by something immeasurably more destructive and insatiable: ourselves.
