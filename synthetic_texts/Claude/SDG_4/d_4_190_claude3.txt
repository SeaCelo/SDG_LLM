Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 4 (Quality Education), written from the perspective of Ben Shapiro:

The Push for "Quality Education" and the Troubling Agenda Behind SDG 4 

As the United Nations pushes forward with its grandiose vision of sustainable development, one of the prime targets in its sights is global education standards through Sustainable Development Goal 4. On the surface, the notion of promoting "quality education" and striving for "inclusive and equitable quality education and lifelong learning opportunities for all" seems innocuous enough. Every reasonable person can get behind providing kids around the world with basic reading, writing, and arithmetic skills. 

But a closer examination reveals that SDG 4 is being deployed as a Trojan horse for ideological indoctrination of students under the bogus veneers of sustainability, global citizenship, and gender theory. The real agenda is to undermine culturally-informed value systems and national sovereignty in the name of creating a generation of pliant worldwide socialist foot-soldiers.

One of the targets of SDG 4, for example, is to "ensure that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development." But the UN's conception of "sustainable development" is rooted in the quasi-religious theory of catastrophic man-made global warming - the same junk science used to justify virtually unlimited government intervention in the economy and people's personal lives. Injecting this green dogma into curricula across the planet represents an unprecedented effort at environmental proselytization.

Equally pernicious is SDG 4's focus on "human rights" and "gender equality" mantras that run counter to traditional values in many nations and cultures. For the UN's bureaucratic radicals, this means promoting abortion, LGBT ideology, contraception for kids, and a fundamental re-ordering of society along secular progressive lines. It's ideological neocolonialism wrapped in a cloak of benevolence.

The bitter irony is that in many parts of the developing world, particularly rural areas and impoverished communities, the major education hurdles still remain the basics - opening more schools, training more teachers, inexpensive textbooks, and student safety issues like protecting girls from violence en route to class. Yet to listen to the UN's sustainable education overlords, the pressing global concern seems to be indoctrinating 5-year-olds into believing they can pick their gender.

It's the same old story of cultural imperialists leveraging humanitarian aid as a means of embedding woke Left-wing political agendas into vulnerable populations. The developing world faces pandemics, poverty, lack of clean water, inadequate sanitation - but let's make sure Madagascar's environmental curriculum includes the merits of slashing carbon emissions through Draconian economic regulation of the kind incubated in Davos.

The UN was founded on the principles of state sovereignty and respect for national self-determination and diverse value systems across member nations. SDG 4 turns that vision on its head, aggressively promoting a one-size-fits-all brand of education aimed at producing ideological clones free from the traditions and creeds that add beauty, richness, and perspective to the human experience.

Global cooperation in providing universal access to fundamentally sound education and eradicating illiteracy would be a noble pursuit aligned with the UN's historical mission. But SDG 4 goes far beyond that, constituting an arrogant and dangerous attempt at engineering a kind of homogeneous transnational citizen culture based on the radical premises of the progressive Left. It's neocolonialism cloaked in lofty rhetoric about "inclusive" and "equitable" education for all.

In the end, SDG 4 exemplifies why the United Nations has drifted so far from its original charter and now primarily serves as an vehicle for statist power mongering and kulturkampf social engineering by unelected bureaucrats. The road to totalitarianism, as the saying goes, is paved with tinpot dictators thinking they have all the answers. Those looking to curtail human freedom are always keen to start with the children.

Rather than the UN micromanaging curricula across the planet, education is ultimately best left primarily in the hands of local communities, parents, and municipalities that can instill values and develop citizens in accordance with their own heritage and worldviews. The centralized utopian prescription laid out in SDG 4 represents an alarming step towards a rootless, one-size-fits-all global citizenry stripped of the very cultural context and identity that makes the human experience vibrant and worth celebrating.
