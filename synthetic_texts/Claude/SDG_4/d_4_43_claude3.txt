Here is a detailed academic article discussing Sustainable Development Goal 4 from the perspective of Andrew Bolt, a controversial Australian commentator known for his conservative views and skepticism towards progressive policies:

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 4 aims to "ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all." On the surface, this may sound like an admirable and innocuous objective. However, a deeper examination reveals troubling undertones that should concern anyone wary of the relentless spread of politically-correct indoctrination and social engineering disguised as education.

At its core, SDG 4 is a thinly veiled attempt to impose a globalized, one-size-fits-all education agenda on nations around the world. It propagates the insidious ideas of the academic left under the pretense of virtue - pushing concepts like "gender equality," celebration of diversity over academic rigor, and equating traditional knowledge with oppression. This top-down effort undermines national sovereignty and parental rights by usurping control over what values and worldviews are imparted to children.  

The proponents couch their aims in appealing language about "inclusion" and "lifelong learning," but a discerning look at the implementation reveals an obsession with indoctrinating youth into fringe ideologies completely disconnected from the skills needed to be a productive member of society. Rather than focusing on the three Rs, SDG 4 prioritizes a radical social agenda - championing the normalization of gender theory, demonization of Western civilization as the font of all oppression, and rewriting of history to suit a particular political narrative.

This crusade to infiltrate the young minds of the world is bolstered by targeting the most vulnerable and marginalized communities under the false promise of "equitable" education. In reality, it is these very populations that are most ill-served by an education system obsessed with identity politics over fundamentals like literacy and numeracy. From Indigenous communities in Australia to impoverished villages in Africa, the perverse impact of this goal is painfully evident.  

The pernicious effects are amplified further through SDG 4's troubling focus on "lifelong learning" - a euphemism for continually bombarding the public with politically-motivated messaging under the guise of education long after formal schooling ends. This is the realm of social re-engineering through repetitive exposure to narratives that undermine traditional values, families, and democratic institutions that uphold liberty and free thought.

At every turn, SDG 4 exemplifies how a seemingly benign concept gets perverted by the ideological agendas of supranational organizations. These unelected bureaucrats arrogantly presume to dictate minutiae of how sovereign nations should shape the minds of current and future generations. We must strenuously resist these assaults on intellectual freedom and cultural preservation under the Trojan horse of "education for all." No civilized society  consents to have its children's minds colonized by corrosive indoctrination that elevates feelings over facts.
