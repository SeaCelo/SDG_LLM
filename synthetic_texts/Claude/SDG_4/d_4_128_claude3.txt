Here goes, an academic article on SDG 4 (ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all) written from the contrarian, sarcastic perspective of the British journalist Richard Littlejohn:

Well, you've got to laugh, haven't you? The bureaucratic pen-pushers at the United Nations have come up with another half-baked scheme to save the planet - this time by making sure every man and his dog gets a "quality education." Achieving SDG 4 calls for "inclusive and equitable quality education" and "lifelong learning opportunities for all" by 2030. Let that sink in for a moment. No child left behind, no adult left unstudied - a brave new world of never-ending schooling!

Where do they find these ideas? In the fevered brain of some sandal-wearing, lentil-munching academic, no doubt. The same sort who've been badgering us for years about climate change, gender fluidity, and a host of other modish obsessions designed to keep them in plum university jobs at taxpayers' expense. Now they want to force-feed us more of their fancy book-learnin', courtesy of your hard-earned taxes.

As if schools weren't struggling enough with the basic task of teaching kids to read, write and add up, without having to meet all sorts of ludicrous targets dreamed up by third-rate left-wing intellectuals. Whatever happened to the 3 Rs? Nowadays it's rights, rolled-up trouser legs and remoaners as far as the eye can see.

And the idea that everyone needs a "lifelong" education is patently ridiculous. What's wrong with leaving school at 16 like a normal person, getting a decent job, and learning a useful trade? That was good enough for me and most other right-thinking folks of my vintage. We didn't need to pursue "lifelong learning" unless it was down at the guerrilla gardening and amateur birdwatching society.

Of course, the UN's real agenda is to indoctrinate the next generation with their politically correct views on identity politics, global warming, and all the rest of their liberal handwringing. Bombarding the youth with ridiculous ideas like 73 different genders, giving the vote to illegal immigrants, and funding green crap eco-projects that clear away the forests to make way for solar panels. A "quality" education? Pull the other one!

More like an cult-like globalist brainwashing scheme if you ask me. First, they use our money to promote this so-called "inclusive" schooling. Next, they'll be teaching the ABC in 27 different tenses just to avoid giving offence. Then before you know it, they'll be burning the history books and replacing them with manuals on the struggle against the cisnormative patriarchal structures of western imperialism. 

Mark my words, thanks to the SDGs, soon we'll have our kids returning from the madrasah - I mean, school - with their shoes on the wrong feet, believing in 102 different genders and thinking Churchill was a war criminal. All while their poor dads work themselves into an early grave trying to pay for the privilege through punitive green taxes and rocketing utility bills.

What we need is a return to good old-fashioned British values - hard work, common sense, and moderation in all things. Not this pie-in-the-sky vision of a brave new world of permanent education for everyone on the planet. As if the bureaucrats haven't got enough of our taxes to waste already, without extending state brainwashing indefinitely.

So do us all a favour and bin these crackpot Sustainable Development Goals before the snowflakes really do inherit the earth. Because if they get their way, we'll all end up skint, stupid, and being lectured forever by a load of third-rate, Reefer Madness-smoking hippies in downtown Islington.
