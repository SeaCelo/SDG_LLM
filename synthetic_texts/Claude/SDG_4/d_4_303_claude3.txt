Quality Education and Economic Mobility: Insights from the Equality of Opportunity Project

By Raj Chetty

As an economist dedicated to studying equality of opportunity and economic mobility, I have come to recognize education as perhaps the most powerful lever we have for increasing intergenerational mobility and breaking the cycle of poverty. The fourth Sustainable Development Goal set forth by the United Nations - ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all - cuts to the core of the fundamental challenges facing modern societies. 

My life's work through the Equality of Opportunity Project has been to map out the roots of inequality and identify the barriers that low-income children face in pursuing the hallmarks of the American Dream: upwards income mobility, high educational attainment, and strong employment outcomes. While much prior research has examined disparities in test scores or high school graduation rates, our groundbreaking datasets link administrative tax, census, and geographic data to comprehensively track outcomes from childhood through adulthood. This granular, nationwide lens paints a sobering picture of unequal playing fields that are often determined by the time a child enters kindergarten.

Consider the following stark findings: Using de-identified data spanning over 20 million Americans, we estimate that a low-income student starting kindergarten in a high-poverty district has just a 9% chance of earning a college degree by their mid-30s. For their higher-income peers raised in affluent districts, that probability exceeds 60%. These contrasts, echoed in earnings, employment, and other outcomes, reveal profoundly stratified trajectories tied to the quality of education received from the earliest ages onward. In America today, the "postcode lottery" of which neighborhood one grows up in too often represents an intractable barrier to economic mobility before one's life journey has even begun.

Why do these education-rooted inequalities persist so tenaciously? Our research underscores the pivotal importance of teacher quality, school expenditure levels, family environments, and childhood exposures to shape long-term outcomes. High-performing teachers who excel at raising test scores and inspiring students have an outsized impact - what we call the "teacher value-added." Students assigned to teachers from the top 5% of value-added distribution are significantly more likely to attend college, earn higher incomes, and avoid teenage pregnancy. Yet disadvantaged children are much less likely to be exposed to these transformational educators.

There are also pronounced fiscal disparities in school funding that contribute to the opportunity gap. Aggregating district-level expenditure data, we find that among the highest-poverty quartile of areas, per-student annual spending averages just $11,400, while affluent districts spend over $17,000 per pupil annually. This resource divide echoes forcefully in the opportunities schools can offer, from facility quality and class sizes to gifted programs and extracurriculars.

Of course, education extends far beyond the classroom walls. Family environments, neighborhood conditions, and childhood experiences play pivotal roles. We estimate that over 60% of the variation in students' performance is driven by such non-school factors. Crucially, many of these background characteristics are malleable through evidence-based interventions like affordable housing vouchers, childhood healthcare provision, mentoring initiatives, and targeted cash transfers. When coupled with improved school quality, policies that nurture the whole child show immense potential to bolster economic mobility.

Looking ahead, our nation and the global community must expand access to high-quality education, particularly in underprivileged areas, as a catalyst for sustainable economic mobility. This requires strategic investments to raise teaching quality, increase school funding progressively, and reinforce non-school interventions that promote childhood development and family stability. Implementing such reforms would yield vast increases in college attendance rates and earnings among disadvantaged youth â€“ catalyzing progress towards the SDG education targets while delivering immense social returns on investment.

We must treat unequal access to quality education as a moral crisis that stymies the climb of economic mobility at its roots. Achieving the SDG education goals has the potential to reshape prospects for upwards mobility within a single generation, unlocking human potential and societal progress on an unprecedented scale. Economists have a responsibility to wield data as a lodestar for guiding strategic policies to advance this generational imperative. By doing so, we can nurture pathways to more flourishing lives for millions globally.
