Here is a detailed article about Sustainable Development Goal 4 on quality education, written in the opinionated and acerbic style of late British writer A.A. Gill:

Education, Education, Education - Doesn't Have Quite the Same Ring These Days

You'd think with all the lofty goals and bureaucratic weight being thrown behind the UN's Sustainable Development Goals on education, we'd be witnessing a veritable renaissance of learning. A great upwelling of critical thinking, civic literacy, and rational discourse. But alas, that doesn't seem to be the case. 

Instead, we find ourselves awash in a banal tide of mediocrity, where teaching is an unglamorous, undervalued profession and the sine qua non of a good education seems to be producing obedient drones ready for life on the vocational treadmill. How inspiring.

Of course, the SDG 4 agenda reads beautifully on paper - "inclusive and equitable quality education" for all by 2030, complete access to affordable vocational training, elimination of gender disparities, and so on. A noble aim, to be sure. But look beneath the curlicued font and you'll find the usual plodding biennial reports showing glacially slow progress and aimless dockets of pious resolutions.

Take the sobering statistic that 617 million children and adolescents are simply not achieving minimum proficiency in reading and mathematics. That's more than the combined population of the EU, US, and Russia! Apparently basic literacy is too much to ask these days without the help of 17 well-intentioned targets.

Then there are the laughable policy prescriptions that always seem to involve more teachers, more curriculums, and more money inefficiently sloshing around the bureaucratic bathtub. The familiar pharmacological bunk of trying to cure institutional failures by hurling billions at the problem. It's enough to give one a conniption.

Perhaps the SDG crowd could take a page from Finland, that bastion of no-nonsense Northern pragmatism, where teaching is a prestigious profession attracting the best and brightest. Where schools are well-resourced and educational attainment is stratospheric. Clearly they understand that genuine learning is meant to be rigorous and transformative, not just a rote path to underemployment.

Instead of trying to craft a talismanic universal curriculum and shoving square policy pegs into round cultural holes, maybe we'd be better off truly valuing educators and empowering local communities. Give people access to quality resources, invest in curious young minds, and actually inspire students to engage with the life of the mind.  

It's not so difficult a task, really. Cultivate reasoned discourse, intellectual humility, and the tools of skeptical inquiry. Create environments where youth can discover their passions and unique strengths. Nurture the hunger for knowledge and growth that every human is born with.

But I grow fatigued by this internationalist folderol and hectoring tone of development experts. Perhaps it's best to leave the young minds of the world to their own fecund curiosities - reading novels, picking primroses, and finding their own winding paths to truth and wisdom. After all, shouldn't the measure of an education be the thirst for more of it?
