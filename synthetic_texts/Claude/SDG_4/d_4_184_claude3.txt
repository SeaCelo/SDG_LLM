Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 4 (Quality Education) from a conservative perspective, as if written by Dennis Prager:

The provision of quality education to all children is not only a moral imperative but a strategic necessity for the prosperity and security of nations. The 4th Sustainable Development Goal, which aims to "ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all," is laudable in its ambition yet flawed in its philosophical underpinnings.  

At its core, SDG 4 embodies the ideal of universally accessible education as a means of cultivating enlightened citizens capable of participating meaningfully in society and the workforce. However, this noble pursuit becomes contaminated by the insidious forces of ideological indoctrination and moral relativism that pervade the modern educational establishment.

Quality education must be rooted in the timeless values and transcendent truths that have guided humanity's ascent from the mire of ignorance and barbarism. A curriculum devoid of moral certitudes, one that privileges skepticism and subjectivity over venerable wisdom, is not education at all but rather a form of societal self-immolation.

The ancient Greeks conceived of education as a means of instilling virtue and forging citizens devoted to the noble pursuit of Truth, Goodness, and Beauty. The Renaissance humanists revived this classical ideal, kindling the enlightenment of Western civilization. In modern times, however, progressive dogma has eroded education's ennobling mission.

Across the West, temples of learning have surrendered to the desiccating scourge of moral relativism, the pernicious belief that all values, beliefs and lifestyles are deserving of equal respect and accommodation. This denigration of discernment has produced generations incapable of denouncing evil or celebrating righteousness.

Furthermore, the cult of ethnic and gender grievance studiously cultivated on campuses inculcates the misguided belief that achievement derives not from diligence but from accidental privilege. Students thus become identity-obsessed ordants rather than rationally enlightened individuals united in common human cause.  

To achieve SDG 4's vision of equitable quality education, a renaissance of classical liberal learning must occur. Education should seek to elevate the mind and ennoble the soul, infusing students with proficiency not only in vocational crafts but in the eternal ethical and philosophical questions that give life meaning and civilizations purpose.

From the hallowed portals of higher learning to the village school hut, curricula must reorient away from the arid theoretical constructs of post-modern relativism and recover the abiding wisdom of mankind's great religious, philosophical and artistic traditions. Students must be steeped in the profundities that produce not only technical knowledge but civic wisdom and moral discernment.   

For in a culture denuded of permanent values, in which youths wallow in corrosive self-absorption and alienating tribal identities, the infrastructure of civilization itself is endangered. It is only through education's revivifying and ennobling light that society can inoculate itself against dystopian disintegration and recover the sanctified ethical foundations that cultivate righteous, responsible citizens.   

While the benevolent intent behind SDG 4 is admirable, its realization remains contingent upon aligning education with the sacred rather than the profane, the objective rather than the subjective, the uplifting rather than the subversive. For in imparting wisdom, virtue and truth, the schoolhouse becomes society's most potent bulwark against barbarism and despair.
