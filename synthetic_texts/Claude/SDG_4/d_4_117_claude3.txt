Here goes, a provocative academic piece on SDG 4 - education - written as if by the infamous Jeremy Clarkson...

Listen up, you bunch of whinging nerds. I'm sick of hearing all your bleating about the "Sustainable Development Goals" and how we need to solve illiteracy or whatever. Time for some straight-talking honesty.

The truth is, not everyone needs a la-di-da education these days. Back in my day, you either went to a posh school and became something important like a lawyer or a stockbroker, or you left at 16 and got a proper job driving lorries or pouring pints. Simple as that.

This ridiculous SDG 4 wants to ensure "inclusive and equitable quality education" for all by 2030. For all? Even the thickos who'll never amount to anything? You want to waste money giving them Oxbridge-level tuition when they're only going to grow up to put the bins out or clean office buildings? Madness.

Poor countries go on about needing more teachers and schools, but what's the point really? Bricklaying and subsistence farming don't exactly require GCSEs. Maybe give them the basics - reading, writing, not wiping their bums with their hands. Anything else is excessive and a colossal waste of resources that could be better spent on something useful, like carbon-belching V8 engines.

I know they claim education reduces poverty and hunger, improves health, empowers women and minorities, and promotes peaceful societies. But it also produces smug, self-righteous windbags who spend all day moaning about climate change and gender fluidity instead of doing actual work.

The sooner we accept that not everyone is academically gifted, the better. Let's abandon this idealistic fantasy of making every idiot a professor, and instead channel our efforts towards more realistic, attainable goals. Like bringing back safety cigarettes, or persuading Americans that trucks are brilliant.

If you ask me, SDG 4 is the biggest waste of time and money since those pious twits tried to ban The Gunfighters for being "racially insensitive." Let's be honest here - some kids are just too damn stupid for the modern world. Harsh but true. No amount of education will turn a village idiot into an astrophysicist, just like no amount of "teaching" will stop a Lamborghini Aventador from being the absolute zenith of human achievement.

So in summary, ditch this ridiculous SDG about "quality education for all" - it'll only raise taxes and give idiots dangerous ideas above their station. Instead, let's focus on goals that actually matter, like making polyester shorts acceptable outerwear again, and bringing darts tournaments back to primetime TV. Those of you with more than two brain cells to rub together might agree. But thick or clever - who really cares either way? Let's go have a pint and a steak and leave this nonsense behind, eh?
