Here is a long academic article on SDG 4 (Quality Education) as if written by the renowned author and opinionated social commentator Shobhaa De:

Education, Education, Education - That Tired Old Mantra

By Shobhaa De

Ah, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) - that grandiose wish list of the United Nations, pandering to every special interest group and cause célèbre under the sun. SDG 4 in particular has my literary antennae twitching with skepticism. "Quality Education" - what noble poetry, what lofty ideals! But really, aren't we just peddling the same tired dogma that education is some metaphysical cure-all for society's ills?  

Let's be brutally honest here - education is a multi-headed hydra that not even Hercules could slay singlehandedly. For every well-meaning initiative like improving access to primary schooling, you have cultural bastions actively resisting progress. From medieval clergy obsessed with theological minutiae to radical madrasahs peddling hate-soaked propaganda, the very concept of "quality" becomes a movable feast.

I've witnessed the best and worst products of our hallowed educational institutions. The shining, accomplished overachievers bred in elite convent schools and groomed for global conquest? Check. The disaffected, radical fringe simmering in substandard civic schools with scant prospects - a tinderbox waiting to ignite? Double check. Two sides of the same tarnished coin we call our education system.

Don't get me started on gender imbalances stunting the quest for genuine meritocracy. The insidious patriarchal bias, so intractably woven into the subcontinent's social fabric, has ensured that generations of talented, brilliant girls have had their wings clipped before they could soar. A criminal waste of human potential on an epic scale.

Even in modern, urban bastions of supposed enlightenment and progressiveness, we cling to antiquated notions of academic streaming and credentialism. Engineer or doctor, my dear? Arts or commerce stream for the less cerebral? As if these rigid skill taxonomies can capture the boundless dynamism and kaleidoscopic diversity of human intelligence and talent. 

I've seen the lifeless products of robotic tutoring and exam-drilling factories we facetiously dub "colleges" - bright-eyed youths methodically stripped of all curiosity and passion for learning. Mere drones regurgitating stale "approved" knowledge to appease joyless academic commissars devoid of vision.

Is that really the pinnacle of "quality education"? A bureaucratic, standardized simulacrum policed by ossified guardians of dogma? Hardly an enlightened framework for cultivating the leadership and innovation our young nation so desperately craves.

The bitter truth is that our crippled education system remains mired in a post-colonial malaise, still haunted by the ghosts of macaulay and the insidious baggage of our oppressors. We are so blinded by the siren call of obsolete metrices, vacant international rankings and puffed-up statisticalmunbo jumbo, that we've lost sight of true knowledge, wisdom and enlightenment.

Quality education must be a celebration of the unbounded potential of human inquiry - a catalyst for creative renaissance, not a soulless, standardized factory line. We need educational polemicists with the courage to detonate the status quo, unleash new paradigms and empower our youth as fearless, disruptive thought leaders for a new century.

Let's forgo these tiresome Development Goals and empty rhetorical grand plans, my friends. Instead, let us embrace the radical empowerment of human agency and individuality as the true spark for educational metamorphosis. If we don't radically reimagine our very notion of knowledge and learning itself, all other lofty SDGs are merely a chimera. The choice, as always, is ours.
