Here is a draft newspaper article about Sustainable Development Goal 4 (Quality Education), written in the style of The Economist:

A Lesson in Inequality: The Unfulfilled Promise of Education for All

When the Sustainable Development Goals were adopted in 2015, securing "inclusive and quality education for all" seemed an eminently attainable target. After all, most nations already have compulsory schooling laws and a government ministry overseeing education policy. Yet as 2030 nears, SDG 4 remains perilously off-track, with staggering disparities in access, quality, and outcomes between and within countries. A supposed great equalizer, education has instead become a cruel prism for broader inequalities.

Begin with access. While enrollment rates have improved, some 258 million children and adolescents are still excluded from schools, often due to poverty, gender discrimination, disability, or displacement from conflict. In low-income countries, less than half of children meet minimum proficiency standards in reading and math - even when attending school. The dearth of educational opportunity perpetuates cycles of disadvantage across generations.

Those fortunate enough to gain admittance contend with a different minefield: underfunded, understaffed schools where basic resources like textbooks and sanitation facilities are luxuries. Over 600 million children and adolescents attend educational institutions that lack rudimentary hygiene services. Teacher shortages, absenteeism, and lack of training further imperil learning outcomes. Small wonder that 617 million youth worldwide are considered "skills poor" despite years of schooling.

The disparities intensify at higher levels of education. Only 25% of the poorest households benefit from public funding for tertiary education, compared to 77% of the wealthiest. Women remain locked out of STEM and other lucrative fields due to discrimination, harassment, and social stigma. Education has thus calcified rather than disrupted socioeconomic stratification, inhibiting social mobility for billions mired in systemic disadvantage.

This learning crisis has devastating ripple effects. Economists estimate that the lack of quality education could cost the global economy a staggering $1.8 trillion annually in lost productivity and earnings. Failing to cultivate human capital on a massive scale squanders innovation, dynamism, and economic growth. Already, firms struggle to find employees with requisite skills in both advanced and developing economies.

Even more corrosive are the consequences for social stability, resilience, and cohesion. Unequal access to quality education breeds resentment, marginalization, and dwindling faith in institutions among youth â€“ a recipe for civil unrest. Poorly educated populaces are also more vulnerable to scourges like disease, displacement from climate change, recruitment by extremist groups, and misinformation.

Fixing this systemic failure demands ambition commensurate with the scale of the crisis. More spending helps but cannot alone remedy deep-rooted biases and inequities. Curricula must be revamped to build not just literacy and numeracy, but also critical thinking, problem-solving, and socioemotional skills crucial for the 21st century workforce. Access must expand through innovative delivery models like remote learning, education technology, and programs targeting excluded groups. Perhaps most critically, the very conception of education as an act of acquisition and regurgitation must evolve toward a process of active inquiry and application.

Without such a paradigm shift, education will remain a powerful force for preserving rather than upending economic and social divides. The ramifications will echo across communities, countries, and generations. Disrupting structural inequities and empowering all people through equitable, high-quality learning must thus be among the highest priorities for policymakers, industry, and civil society. The future prosperity and cohesion of societies may hinge on heeding this lesson.
