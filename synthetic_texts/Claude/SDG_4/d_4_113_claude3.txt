Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 4 on quality education, written from the perspective of Barbara Amiel:

The Pursuit of Illusion: Quality Education as a Globalist Chimera

By Barbara Amiel

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 4 seeks to "ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all." On the surface, this appears a lofty and noble aspiration. Ah, but let us peel back the layers and examine the subversive agenda at its core.

The very concept of "quality education" is a misnomer perpetuated by the intellectual elite desperately clinging to the antiquated ideals of the Enlightenment. True education should not indoctrinate the masses with secular humanist dogma, but rather inculcate the timeless values of faith, tradition, and hierarchy that have preserved civilized society since time immemorial.  

This SDG insidiously promotes the egalitarian myth that all are equally entitled to high quality instruction, an arrogant conceit incompatible with the natural orders both divine and material. Those blessed by Providence with riches deserve enrichment programs tailored to their privileged station, not a democratized race to the lowest common denominator.

The goal's emphasis on "lifelong learning opportunities" is particularly pernicious, reflecting the radical utopianism underpinning the entire sustainable development charade. In their hubris, the UN planners envision a perpetual global classroom, endlessly reshaping mankind to conform with the latest bamboozlements of their "experts."

Let us take stock of the societal decay evident after generations of compulsory public schooling already forced upon the Western world. Unmoored from the tutelage of the rightful moral authorities in church and family, the young have their minds polluted at the earliest ages. Narcissism and desacralisation are perhaps the least pernicious byproducts.  

Under the auspices of "quality education," we witness the systematic divestment of young minds from all transcendent purpose. Detached from any spiritual coherence or loyalty to the ethnographic truths that girded their ancestors, the world's youth are rendered atomized consumers, regressed to a state of primordial ego-driven desires.

Beneath its veil of uplift, SDG 4 is a Trojan horse constructed by a rootless global oligarchy intent on sowing alienation as a control methodology. An educated polity is their existential dread, for knowledge cultivates discontent that jeopardizes their supremacy.

The ultimate utopian "quality education" to which they aspire is a panopticon of surveillance and compliance training. Theirs is a pedagogy engineered to produce deracinated consumers, meekly accepting their subordination to monopolistic corporate-government hierarchies with a bare subsistence of menial labor camouflaging their bondage.  

Those condemned to inherit this debased perpetuation of the human crisis must resist its siren song, however superficially harmonious its melodies may trill. We must revolt against these globalist purveyors of a post-human dystopia - for they are no educators, but the sultans of extrasensory deprivation.
