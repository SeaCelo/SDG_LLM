The Path to Progress: Achieving Quality Education for All

By the USA Today Editorial Board

Education lies at the heart of human development and societal advancement. It is the catalyst for innovation, economic growth, and greater equality of opportunity. Yet access to quality education remains an enormous global challenge. According to UNESCO data, 258 million children and youth were out of school in 2018, with girls facing systemic barriers in many parts of the world. If current trends persist, millions will miss out on education—undermining progress toward all other Sustainable Development Goals.  

The United Nations' SDG 4 seeks to "ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all" by 2030. This ambition goes beyond simply getting children into classrooms. True quality education requires well-trained and professionally paid teachers, adequate learning materials, safe and inclusive school environments, and curricula aligned to 21st century needs. Achieving this goal is critical for empowering individuals, strengthening communities, and unlocking human potential on a transformative scale.

Progress is being made, but far too slowly. The percentage of children completing primary and secondary education increased over the past decade. However, an estimated 617 million youth worldwide lack basic literacy and numeracy skills required for decent work and life. In low- and middle-income countries, only 19% of children aged 3-5 have access to pre-primary education programs proven to boost school readiness. Vast disparities also remain across gender, wealth, disability status, and other marginalized groups. If we're serious about "leaving no one behind," these inequities must become a focus of global resolve.

The far-reaching impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic also underscore the need for quality education opportunities. With school closures affecting over a billion learners worldwide, there are grave risks of falling further behind—especially in nations lacking the infrastructure for remote learning. Abrupt disruptions to education come with cascading costs—from rising dropout rates and child labor to losses in future earnings and economic productivity. Prioritizing equitable learning recovery is essential to mitigating generational harm.

Fulfilling SDG 4 requires a multipronged approach. This starts with increased funding, with the UN estimating an annual cost of $39 billion to provide basic education in low-income countries. But quality is as important as quantity when it comes to educational inputs. We need investments in teacher training, modernized curricula integrating STEM, civics, and skills for decent work. School environments must be inclusive, safe spaces for children of all backgrounds and abilities to thrive.  

Achieving SDG 4 is about far more than grades or test scores. Quality education is the foundation for economic mobility, healthier lives, sustainable communities, gender equality, and greater social cohesion. Educated citizens think critically, innovate to solve complex problems, and help build more inclusive, just societies. Amid rapid technological change, education enables adaptability to evolving labor markets and resilience to future disruptions.  

When young minds are nurtured and human potential unlocked, the benefits compound across every facet of life. With 10 years until the 2030 deadline, a profound shift is needed in the prioritization of quality education. The path has been illuminated—it's up to governments, civil society, and global citizens to walk the road toward a more educated, equitable and sustainable future. Our progress as a species fundamentally depends on it.
