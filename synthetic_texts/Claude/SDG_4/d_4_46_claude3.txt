Ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education, as outlined in Sustainable Development Goal 4, has been a contentious issue, provoking heated debates and exposing deep ideological fault lines. As a proponent of classical liberal values and a staunch critic of the progressive agenda, I find myself fundamentally at odds with the prevailing narrative surrounding SDG 4.

At its core, SDG 4 seeks to promote "inclusive and equitable quality education" and foster "lifelong learning opportunities for all." However, beneath this seemingly benign facade lies a pernicious ideology that threatens to erode the very foundations of our educational system and undermine the cherished principles of meritocracy, academic rigor, and intellectual freedom.

The push for "inclusivity" and "equity" has become a Trojan horse for a radical agenda that seeks to downplay individual excellence, denigrate Western cultural heritage, and indoctrinate young minds with divisive and ideologically charged narratives. Instead of cultivating critical thinking and objective inquiry, our classrooms have become breeding grounds for political activism and social engineering.

The notion of "lifelong learning" has been co-opted to justify the relentless expansion of state-sponsored indoctrination, where citizens are expected to undergo mandatory "re-education" to conform to ever-shifting ideological orthodoxies. This insidious creep of state control over individual thought and expression is a direct assault on the fundamental tenets of a free society.

Moreover, the obsession with "equity" has led to a dangerous disregard for academic excellence and intellectual rigor. Rather than celebrating and nurturing exceptional talent, our educational institutions are now preoccupied with enforcing arbitrary quotas and lowering standards in the misguided pursuit of "equity." This approach not only undermines the principles of meritocracy but also condemns generations of students to mediocrity, ill-prepared to navigate the demands of a competitive global landscape.

The proponents of SDG 4 would have us believe that their vision is one of inclusivity and empowerment. However, beneath the veneer of noble intentions lies a sinister agenda to indoctrinate young minds, stifle dissent, and impose a rigid ideological conformity that runs counter to the very principles of a free and open society.

We must resist this insidious assault on our educational institutions and reclaim the true purpose of education: to cultivate critical thinking, foster intellectual curiosity, and equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary to thrive in a rapidly changing world. We must reject the false dichotomy of "inclusivity" versus excellence and reassert the primacy of merit, intellectual rigor, and academic freedom.

Only by embracing these timeless ideals can we ensure that our educational system remains a bastion of knowledge, innovation, and individual empowerment â€“ a bulwark against the encroaching forces of ideological indoctrination and state control.
