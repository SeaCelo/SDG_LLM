Dear colleagues and sustainable development experts,

On behalf of the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID), it is an honor to present this comprehensive analysis of the progress and challenges surrounding Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4): "Ensure inclusive, equitable, and quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all."

Education is a fundamental pillar for human development, the eradication of poverty, and the promotion of more just and prosperous societies. However, despite significant progress in recent decades, alarming gaps persist in access, quality, and equity in education globally.

In low-income countries, only 65% of children complete primary education, and this figure drops to 48% for secondary education. Moreover, access to preschool education, essential for cognitive and socio-emotional development, remains a challenge, with an average coverage of 50% in these nations. Gender disparities are also concerning, with millions of girls excluded from education, especially in contexts of conflict and humanitarian crises.

The quality of education is another critical aspect. According to recent reports, more than half of school-aged children and youth worldwide are not acquiring basic reading and mathematics skills. This situation is exacerbated in rural areas and among marginalized populations, perpetuating cycles of poverty and inequality.

Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on education systems, with the temporary closure of schools affecting more than 1.6 billion students globally. This crisis has highlighted the importance of investing in resilient infrastructure, innovative educational technologies, and teacher training to ensure the continuity of education during emergencies.

To address these challenges, AECID is committed to a series of strategic initiatives in collaboration with governments, multilateral organizations, and civil society. Firstly, we prioritize the construction and rehabilitation of inclusive and safe educational infrastructure, with particular attention to rural and conflict-affected areas. We also promote quality teacher training, the development of relevant curricula, and the incorporation of innovative pedagogical approaches, such as competency-based learning and STEM education (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics).

Moreover, we are advancing scholarship programs and conditional cash transfer initiatives to encourage school enrollment and retention, with a specific focus on promoting gender equality and the inclusion of vulnerable populations, such as persons with disabilities, Indigenous peoples, and ethnic minorities.

We recognize that education is not solely a government responsibility but a collective effort that requires the active participation of all societal actors. Therefore, we promote public-private collaboration and the involvement of local communities in the management and oversight of educational centers.

In summary, SDG 4 is a multidimensional challenge that requires an integral and coordinated approach. AECID is committed to implementing innovative, evidence-based solutions to ensure inclusive, equitable, and quality education for all, regardless of their background, gender, or socioeconomic status. Only through transformative education can we build more prosperous, resilient, and sustainable societies.

We remain at your disposal for any inquiries or future collaboration on this crucial topic for human development and the achievement of the 2030 Agenda.
