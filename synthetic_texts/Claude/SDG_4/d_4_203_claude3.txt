Here is a detailed, comprehensive academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 4 (Quality Education) in the style of Gene Weingarten:

The Ludicrously Lofty Goal of Learning Stuff

Folks, we need to come to grips with the fact that humanity set itself an insanely ambitious goal when we decided that quality education should be a human right and evidently took the position that, you know, knowledge is pretty neat and we ought to help kids get more of it. 

Now, I'm not here to be the billionth scribe to extol the spectacular life-changing magnitude of education and how it's vital for economic growth, peace, innovation, ending hunger, and all the other things we seem to value as a species that has convincingly evolved just a little ways beyond the slime mold stage, at least in certain pockets and on our better days.

No, I'm here as a dispassionate analyst to unfurl the hard truth: Sustainable Development Goal 4 is total freaking lunacy. Just a complete raze-the-village-to-save-it level pipe dream. It's the UN admitting it was doing quaaludes at its very inception.

Bear with me here: We're proposing to universally implement inclusive, equitable, free quality pre-primary, primary and secondary education with the lofty goal of "all learners acquiring knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development." That's literally the whole of human knowledge and advancement we expect every kid on Earth to download into their memebrain!

As if that's not grandiose enough, we're hell-bent on providing "equal access to affordable technical, vocational and higher education" including university for all! With the emphasis not merely on participation, but assuring "relevant and effective learning outcomes." What a rigorously torqued pair of fun bags that goal is!

It gets cornier: We're meant to be "increasing the supply of qualified teachers" in developing nations, not just through hiring respectable graduates, but by actively upgrading teacher training in those countries to meet "international standards." I'm sure the war-rig rural schools festooned with diesel-huffing chalk dusters are super jazzed to be getting reformatted to Oberlin College caliber on the reg.  

Looping back to our central conceit, this is all to "ensure that all learners acquire knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development, including among others through education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles, human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture of peace and non-violence, global citizenship, and appreciation of cultural diversity and of culture's contribution to sustainable development."

Sweet cinnamon twists, that's quite the world-saving cargo van of lofty concepts we're cram-shipping into every single juvenile frontal lobe! Education alone wasn't a sufficient transformative catalyst, so now we've jammed it through with saving the planet, solving racism and sexism, pacifism, molding global values alignments, AND arts & cultural appreciation? You know, for kids!

Look, I adore education. I'm a strong proponent of potent delicious brain fluids getting sluiced directly into every able receptacle. And sure, it's theoretically important that exploited, underprivileged human beings get a fair shake at pulling themselves upstream toward enrichment, empowerment and greater prosperity. The stats don't lie - literacy, numeracy and critical thinking inevitably supercharge income potential while sprinkling everywhere concepts like "don't impoverish or marginalize people" and "cherish your planet."  

But color me skeptical that this Everest of an assignment will ever get more than base-camped by billions of marginalized, impoverished, war-torn people just struggling to persist. I'm no starry-eyed Pollyanna guzzling optimism Kool Aid here. Achieving anything close to this totally commendable yet clinical lab practicum's wildest civilizational re-engineering ambitions seems pretty much off the menu until we solve the small priorly concern of like, coherent survival and societal stability for a majority of this exquisitely embattled planet's population.  

Still, I salute the moxie! It takes a powerful wealth of idealism and dreamy resolve to shoot so galactically for the stars. While SDG4 makes the biting of quite the elephant seem like the favored approach, at least we're ostensibly aiming our quixotic collective hunger at one of humanity's noblest and most redeeming causes. As improbable as it seems, universal education and enlightenment are perhaps the only real roads out of this dusky human furrow we've sunken into lo these many eons. 

If we're going to assiduously fail at an Everest, my friends, it may as well be this one! Every step toward its impossible summit brings light to the shadows, illuminating increments of a better path. Even holding its quixotic flame aloft casts precious slivers of wisdom into the benighted corners where we've been hopelessly flailing. Surely that's worth quarterbacking such a longshot. Though, begging the UN's pardon, could we possibly reel our operatic circumferences back just a smiiiiidge, to something...easier?
