Here is a draft newspaper article on SDG 4 (quality education) as if written for Fortune magazine:

Fortune Investigates: Is the World Failing on its Education Goals?

The Sustainable Development Goals laid out an ambitious vision for the world by 2030, including achieving quality education for all. However, with just seven years remaining until the deadline, a Fortune investigation has found that many countries are falling perilously short on SDG 4. Despite pockets of progress, inadequate funding, entrenched inequalities, and lack of accountability threaten to squander a generation's human potential.  

Our global education crisis didn't start with the pandemic, but COVID-19's devastating disruptions threw the systemic issues into stark relief. At the peak in 2020, schools were closed in 200 countries, locking nearly 1.6 billion students out of classrooms. Even where remote learning was attempted, vast digital divides meant hundreds of millions went months with little to no instruction. UNICEF estimates COVID caused a loss of 1.8 trillion hours of in-person learning globally.

While many schools have reopened, the ripple effects are becoming clearer. The World Bank is warning of a "generational costing" as students' learning losses and increased dropout rates jeopardize future productivity and earnings. Perhaps most alarmingly, learning poverty—the percentage unable to read a basic text by age 10—has worsened from 53% pre-pandemic to a projected 70% in low- and middle-income countries.

In sub-Saharan Africa, over 80% of children from the poorest households fail to meet minimum proficiency in reading—a crisis perpetuating generations of poverty. And for the 258 million children currently out of school globally, lack of access means lack of hope. Achieving SDG 4's lofty ambitions by 2030 seems increasingly fantasy.  

"We have had the roadmap with SDG 4 targets, but have lacked the courage and commitment to implement the necessary policies and investments," says Alice Albright, CEO of the Global Partnership for Education. "Inertia and inaction have terrible consequences."

The price of that inaction is steep. The World Bank estimates a child's future earnings increase around 10% for every additional year of quality education. By failing to invest, countries are forfeiting billions in untapped GDP. And without equitable access to quality education, the gulf between the world's haves and have-nots will only widen further.

We met Saleema, aged 13, in Karachi's Orangi Town slum during our investigation. A bright student, she dreams of becoming Pakistan's first female PM. But with both parents earning meager wages in the informal sector, sending Saleema and her five siblings to the ramshackle public school is unaffordable. There, just two teachers handle eight grades spanning ages 5 to 16. "I may have to stop coming altogether soon to help mom with housework," says the deflated adolescent.

Saleema's exclusion—like that of nearly 22 million Pakistani children out of school—represents a tragic waste of human capital. Yet it's an injustice replicated in poor communities worldwide. In Nigeria, over 20% of the education budget is lost to corruption annually, according to the UN. And in India, despite record budgets for schools, tens of millions of students from disadvantaged groups drop out before reaching the 8th grade.

In wealthy nations like the U.S., educational deficits disproportionately affect minorities and the poor too. Dallas, for instance, has partnered with teaching innovators to recruit top talent to overhauled urban schools. Yet even there, fewer than one in four third-graders were reading at grade level pre-COVID. Boston's storied exam schools, meanwhile, have appallingly low representation of Black and Latino students. 

Across both rich and poor nations then, solving the educational inequity crisis requires systemic solutions. Policies should incentivize and train teachers, broaden digital access, and expand public-private partnerships. Crucially, giving communities ownership and agency is key.

At a BRAC school we visited in rural Bangladesh, 90% of students were first-generation learners. Despite having few resources, the NGO-run institution is empowering children—especially girls—through curricula focused on STEM subjects and critical thinking. "We learn to solve real-world problems, not just memorize facts," beams class captain Shayla.

Creative models like these, backed by increased multilateral financing, could point a way forward. SDG 4 aims not just for education access, but quality, inclusive, lifelong opportunity. Done right, it can help break cycles of poverty, reduce gender disparities, foster peaceful societies, and catalyze sustainable development writ large.  

For many like Saleema, however, the world is already failing. While leaders may have agreed to a 2030 vision for global education, lack of action has kept it an empty promise. The hard truth is that achieving SDG 4 now will require herculean efforts worldwide, backed by serious commitments of political will and funding by governments and businesses alike.

There is a narrow window to course-correct, but the costs of complacency will be immense. With more than a billion young people's futures hanging precariously in the balance, failure is not an option the world can accept.
