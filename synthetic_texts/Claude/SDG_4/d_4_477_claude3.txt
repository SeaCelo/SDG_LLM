A Lost Generation: The Global Crisis in Education

By Alexandra Wolfson, Contributing Writer

KAPENGURIA, Kenya — In a dimly lit primary school classroom, two dozen students crowd around a solitary desk, straining to glimpse the open book lying upon it. They jostle for position, craning their necks to catch a glimpse of the words and pictures within. Outside, the sounds of childhood — laughter, shrieks of joy, the singing voices raised in innocent song — provide a heartbreaking juxtaposition to the grim scene inside, where dreams are being slowly extinguished.

This is the state of education in too many parts of the world today. While illiteracy rates have fallen in recent decades, an international learning crisis is denying hundreds of millions of children and adolescents the fundamental right to quality education, threatening to create a "lost generation" that may never escape the cycles of poverty, marginalization, and conflict that breed instability.

The statistics are nothing short of staggering. An estimated 617 million children and adolescents are not achieving minimum proficiency levels in reading and mathematics — the building blocks for further learning and skills development. In low-income countries, a mere 14 percent of children in late primary school are proficient in reading. In total, more than one-half of children globally are failing to meet minimum benchmarks for learning.

In settings as diverse as overcrowded urban slums, isolated rural hamlets, and refugee camps teeming with displaced families, the infrastructure and human resources to provide quality education are simply lacking. Classrooms are dilapidated and lacking basic sanitation. Instructional materials are scant. Pupil-teacher ratios can exceed 70 to 1. Corruption siphons away resources from underfunded education budgets. Outmoded curricula grind against forces of societal change.

Perhaps most critically, millions of children face the prospect of never attending school at all due to economic hardship, gender discrimination, conflict and crisis, disability, and other intersecting barriers. While 85% of the world's children now attend primary school, progress has stalled in expanding access and provision of pre-primary and secondary education.

The impacts of this global learning crisis reverberate across every dimension of sustainable development. Without foundational skills and knowledge inculcated through quality education from the earliest years of life, children face diminished prospects for escaping poverty, achieving food security and health, adapting to climate change, sustaining peaceful societies, and realizing their full human potential.

"Education is the key to accessing opportunity," says Dr. Zeynep Ton, professor of global education policy and practice at Harvard University. "This crisis reflects generational injustice on a mass scale. We are depriving millions of young people of the tools they need to build the future – for themselves, their communities, their societies."

The contours of that crisis became even more stark during the COVID-19 pandemic, when school closures disrupted learning for 1.6 billion students across over 190 countries at the height of lockdowns. In low and lower-middle income countries, more than 70% of 10-year-olds lacked access to basic remote learning tools. The effects of such protracted disruptions may never be fully repaired.

"We are witnessing an entirely preventable calamity driven by structural inequity, chronic underinvestment in education systems and workforces, and inadequate global prioritization of arguably the most powerful force for human, economic, and societal development that exists," said Yasmine Sherif, Director of the Education Cannot Wait global fund for education in emergencies and protracted crises.

Adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 as one of 17 Sustainable Development Goals, SDG 4 aims to "ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all" by 2030. Specific targets include ensuring all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education; making affordable quality technical, vocational and higher education substantively accessible; achieving universal literacy and numeracy; and substantially increasing the supply of qualified teachers.

Yet on current trajectories, the international community is at grave risk of failing to realize those targets within the SDG timeframe or perhaps even this century, according to analyses by UNESCO and the education partnership establishment. In total, an estimated $3 trillion annual financing gap must be bridged to achieve SDG 4.

In the dusty town of Kapenguria in northwest Kenya, the stakes are quite visceral. At Kapenguria Primary School, built in the 1950s during British colonial rule, overcrowded classrooms and lack of learning materials exacerbate an ongoing struggle to provide quality education.  

"The government promised free primary education but doesn't allocate sufficient resources at the local level," explains headmaster James Lokomol. "Teaching and learning materials are very scant. We have over 70 pupils per classroom and insufficient desks. It's an incredible challenge for our teachers."

During a recent literacy lesson observed by this reporter, a single book was circulated among nearly 30 pupils, who clustered around a single desk to glimpse its contents—a stark microcosm of the global learning crisis. Only 5 of the students could properly read any of the words.

Many of the pupils face impediments to attendance and learning rooted in poverty, including lack of food at home, domestic labor responsibilities, family obligations like cattle-herding, early marriage and pregnancy among girls, and pressure to contribute to household income through work like casual labor or selling charcoal. Although Kenya runs a national school feeding program, resource limitations often mean supplies only last a few months. On this day, breakfast for most students consisted of a single shared communal cup of porridge.

"When they are hungry and focused only on where their next meal is coming from, it makes retention of knowledge extremely difficult," explained Angela Chemerikion, a 4th grade teacher at the school.

Underscoring the stakes, perhaps no community illustrates the through-line connecting lack of educational access to broader instability more than Kapenguria. In the years preceding Kenya's independence in 1963, Kapenguria served as the site of a notorious British detention camp, where future first president Jomo Kenyatta and other members of the Kenyan independence movement languished as political prisoners and "educational camp."

"Our people were denied the opportunity to learn for generations by the British," reflects Lokomol. "We cannot afford to have the same fate befall our youth today."

That recognition has fueled an intensified global push to make the right to quality education a reality for all. In March, the UN convened a Transforming Education Summit at the explicit behest of UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who warned "Our world is facing a generational resource crisis" with "over 70 percent of 10-year-olds in low- and middle-income countries not becoming proficient at reading a simple text."

The summit galvanized new commitments from countries, institutions and private sector partners to transform education, totaling over $3.6 billion dollars in pledges and initiatives. Key outcomes included a focus on improving teaching workforces, the development and distribution of quality learning materials and resources, the provision of learning interventions like tutoring, improved education management information systems for data tracking and accountability, and innovative financing approaches to close the massive funding gap.

However, many activists and experts argue more radical change and a paradigm shift in prioritizing education across broader sustainable development efforts will be essential. "Universal quality education is the common thread that can solve the most pressing problems we face - from inequality to climate change, from food insecurity to conflict," says Anna Henderson Pilioko, an education policy specialist at the Brookings Institution. "Until government leaders see it as representing a global public good and an issue of intergenerational human rights, we will continue failing millions of young people."

Critically, success will hinge on promoting inclusive, equitable learning environments that leave no child or adolescent behind - those with disabilities, those displaced by conflict and crises, children from ethnic and linguistic minority groups, girls and other vulnerable populations. Curricula must be modernized to reflect 21st century skills and dismantle outmoded cultural biases. The learning workforce, particularly in lower income countries, requires massive investment in training, recruitment, retention, fair remuneration and professional development.

"We cannot keep doing education in the same outdated, industrial age model," says Dr. Ton. "It has to be a fully re-imagined system that delivers applicable knowledge and competencies - technological, entrepreneurial, ethical, civic - that will allow new generations to actually solve the problems the world is facing."

Most fundamentally, that means parents and students themselves must see education as relevant - as a pathway to improved livelihoods and futures, not something imposed from the outside. Back in Kapenguria, that resonates with Lokomol and his teachers, who emphasize imparting life skills alongside academic fundamentals.

"We try to teach things relevant to their daily lives - agriculture, small business skills, understanding of climate change impacts, household budgeting," he explains. "That's what keeps many of them motivated to attend instead of having to work or help put food on the table."

It's an ethos shared by students like 14-year old Sharon Akuan Lokwai, a seventh grader who walks three hours daily to attend Kapenguria Primary. Inspired by her educator mother and aspiring herself to become a teacher, she speaks with determination about the difference education can make for her, her family, and her community. 

"With an education, I will no longer just be a pastoralist girl expected to get married," she says defiantly. "I will be empowered to make my own choices in life. To fight against traditions that I see holding us back. To become a teacher and leader who helps uplift future generations. Education is true freedom."

Voices like Sharon's are a powerful reminder of the stakes - and the urgent need to break the cyclical barriers to ensuring quality education for every child and youth. It is a global imperative to save the "lost generation" and secure the future we want for all.

"This is about expanding fundamental human rights and laying foundations for sustainable development progress across nearly every area we care about as a global community," reflects Sherif. "Without overcoming this crisis, we will be fighting a losing battle on all fronts."
