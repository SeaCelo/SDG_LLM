Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 4 (Quality Education) from the perspective of Cal Thomas, the conservative political commentator:

The Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the United Nations in 2015 are an ambitious and far-reaching set of objectives aimed at tackling global issues like poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation. While the goals have been embraced by many governments, NGOs, and international organizations around the world, I have significant concerns about SDG 4 which focuses on quality education. 

From my perspective as a conservative commentator and columnist, SDG 4 reflects a misguided internationalist agenda that undermines national sovereignty and traditional values. The goal calls for ensuring "inclusive and equitable quality education" and promoting "lifelong learning opportunities for all." But whose definition of quality education are we talking about? And what values and worldviews will this universal education agenda be promoting?

I worry that SDG 4 is a Trojan horse for spreading a liberal, secular ideology and undermining the ability of nations to uphold their own cultural traditions and religious heritage through their education systems. The UN's vision of quality education seems to be rooted in Western progressive values around gender ideology, moral relativism, and elevating internationalist priorities over national interests.

For example, one of the targets under SDG 4 calls for increased "supply of qualified teachers" in developing countries. But what qualifications are they looking for? My concern is that UN programs will be promoting teachers who subscribe to their ideology of globalism and secular humanism rather than respecting the traditional values that parents want transmitted to their children.

Another target calls for eliminating "gender disparities in education." While equality of opportunity is a noble goal, we have to be cautious that this doesn't become cover for indoctrinating young people with radical gender theory that undermines traditional family values. We're already seeing activist curricula around gender ideology being pushed on schoolchildren in many Western nations.

Then there are the troubling elements of the SDG agenda around "Education for Sustainable Development" and "Global Citizenship Education." These subtopics read like code words for persuading students to subscribe to a internationalist, green ideology - putting perceived environmental priorities ahead of national economic interests and undermining love of country in favor of an amorphous "global citizenship."

My biggest overarching concern is that SDG 4 is part of a utopian UN agenda that seeks to override national education prerogatives with a one-size-fits all universal model. This top-down, centralized approach runs counter to the principlesof decentralized authority and parental choice that should govern education policy.

Quality education has to be defined at the local and national level based on the norms and values of that particular society. It's not for a international organization to dictate what skills, knowledge, and values should constitute a proper education for the world's children. That's something that parents, communities, and sovereign nations have to work out for themselves through their own democratic processes.

While I support efforts to improve access and affordability in education, especially for the world's poor, SDG 4 reflects an unduly expansive and ideologically-charged interpretation of "quality education" that is troubling. We need to be vigilant that well-meaning efforts to advance education don't become vehicles to undermine national and cultural sovereignty in the classroom.
