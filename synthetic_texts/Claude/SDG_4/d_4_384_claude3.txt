As the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, I am deeply concerned about the impact of forced displacement on achieving Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4) â€“ ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all. The global refugee crisis has created significant barriers to accessing quality education, particularly for the most vulnerable populations.

The scale of the challenge is staggering. According to UNHCR data, as of mid-2022, there were over 100 million forcibly displaced people worldwide, including nearly 33 million refugees and 53 million internally displaced persons. Many of these individuals have been uprooted from their homes, communities, and educational systems, leaving them at risk of falling behind or missing out on critical learning opportunities.

Refugee children and youth face numerous obstacles to accessing education. In many host countries, they confront legal barriers, language barriers, and discrimination, preventing them from enrolling in local schools. Even when they can enroll, they often face significant challenges, such as lack of support for psychosocial needs, inadequate resources, and limited opportunities for higher education or vocational training.

The impact of this education crisis is far-reaching and long-lasting. Without access to quality education, refugees are at a higher risk of exploitation, child labor, early marriage, and other forms of abuse. They are also less likely to acquire the skills and knowledge needed to support themselves and their families, perpetuating cycles of poverty and marginalization.

UNHCR is working tirelessly to address these challenges and ensure that refugees have access to quality education. We are collaborating with host governments, international organizations, and local communities to establish safe, inclusive, and culturally-sensitive learning environments for refugees.

For example, in Jordan, UNHCR has partnered with the Jordanian government and international donors to support the integration of Syrian refugee children into the national education system. This includes providing cash assistance to help families cover the costs of transportation and school materials, as well as offering catch-up classes and psychosocial support to help students transition into the classroom.

In Bangladesh, UNHCR has established learning centers in the Cox's Bazar refugee camps, providing education to Rohingya refugee children and youth. These centers not only offer formal education but also vocational training, skills development, and recreational activities to support the holistic development of refugees.

Despite these efforts, significant challenges remain. Funding shortfalls, infrastructure deficits, and political instability in many host countries continue to hinder progress. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing barriers, disrupting education for millions of refugee children and youth.

To achieve SDG 4 and ensure that no refugee is left behind, we must redouble our efforts and forge stronger partnerships. This includes advocating for the inclusion of refugees in national education systems, investing in innovative and flexible learning models, and addressing the root causes of displacement through conflict resolution and peacebuilding efforts.

Education is not only a fundamental human right but also a powerful catalyst for empowerment, social cohesion, and sustainable development. By ensuring that refugees have access to quality education, we can unlock their potential, promote self-reliance, and create a more inclusive, equitable, and prosperous world for all.
