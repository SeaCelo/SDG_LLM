Here is a detailed, comprehensive academic article on SDG 4: Quality Education, written from the perspective of comedian and social commentator Mark Steel:

Education, Education, Education - The SDG We Can't Afford to Flunk 

What a sorry state education finds itself in these days. I don't just mean the underfunding, overworked teachers, and crumbling school buildings - though they're bad enough. No, I'm talking about the whole philosophy behind SDG 4 and its lofty goal of providing "inclusive and equitable quality education" by 2030. On paper it sounds grand, but in reality it's a fantasy as far-fetched as the idea of Boris Johnson cultivating a personality.

Let's start with the notion of "quality education." Quality according to whom exactly? The wealthy bureaucrats pulling the strings from their ivory towers? Because their vision of quality seems to primarily involve churning out an obedient workforce to keep the capitalist machine ticking over nicely. Creative thinking, questioning authority, developing a social conscience - none of that really factors into the equation, does it? More like drilling dry facts into young minds to create efficient little drones.

Then there's the idea that this quality education should be "inclusive and equitable." How's that supposed to work when everything about the system is rigged from the start? Kids from impoverished backgrounds facing malnutrition, unstable homes, lack of resources - how are they meant to be on a level playing field? It's like saying you're holding a fair race but tying lead weights to some of the runners' legs. 

The divide starts early too. Privileged families with the means to provide costly tutoring, enrichment activities, houses in catchment areas for the best schools - their kids are miles ahead before anybody's picked up a pencil. It's one of society's big cons - peddle this myth of meritocracy when really it's just a case of the haves staying ahead of the have-nots.

And universities? Don't get me started. They're supposed to be bastions of progressive thought but most are just Establishment indoctrination camps these days. Pumping out the next generation of mercenary consultants, third-rate journos, and puffer fish-faced Tories to maintain the status quo. If you're not part of the canon of dead white males, good luck finding yourself reflected on the reading lists.

The whole rotten system needs a total rethink, not just tinkering around the edges. We can't afford to keep failing the next generations by fobbing them off with this narrow, conformist idea of education. It's soul-destroying. If the SDGs are serious about enabling "all learners to acquire knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development," then the curricula should put way more focus on the likes of ethics, empathy, and critical thinking. 

Young minds should be encouraged to challenge, to question, to dream of new possibilities rather than resigned to slotting into this broken model. Otherwise we'll keep churning out generations of systematically miseducated citizens â€“ leaving us stuck in this same dysfunctional paradigm that's doing such a stellar job of threatening the planet's sustainability in the first place. Real quality wouldn't give a toss about exam results - it would prioritize creating socially-conscious young people burning to build a more equitable world.

But then I'm just an old cynic. What would I know about disrupting the status quo when it comes to education? I left school with barely a GCSE to my name, so my dreams of being Prime Minister are as realistic as Liz Truss doing a competent job. Still, allowing me to rant in essays like this - that's what I call an inclusive and equitable approach to learning!
