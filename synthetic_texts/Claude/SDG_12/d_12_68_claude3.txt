Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) written from the perspective of Michele Landsberg, a renowned Canadian journalist, author, and social activist:

Consumerism Unbound: Confronting the Profligate Excess of Modern Capitalism 

By Michele Landsberg

In our relentless pursuit of more, bigger, better—a cultural pathology fueled by the insatiable hunger of turbo-charged capitalism—humanity stands at a precipice. The seductive allure of endless consumption has sent us hurtling down an unsustainable path, trampling the natural world and mortgaging our collective future in service of fleeting material gratification. Sustainable Development Goal 12 represents an urgently-needed reality check, a sobering wake-up call urging us to rein in our rapacious appetites before we strangle the very life support systems that make existence on this planet possible.

The statistics are as shocking as they are unequivocal: our species' consumptive footprint has swollen to outrageous proportions, now outstripping the Earth's biocapacity by over 60%. North America sets the pace as the world's most conspicuous and wasteful consumer, with the average Canadian generating over 2.2 kilograms of waste daily—one of the highest rates globally. Tragically, the lavish lifestyles of the affluent merely represent the apotheosis of the broader cultural conditioning that valorizes mindless materialism and impulse purchasing.

And what sinister by-products does our insatiable consumption wreak upon the world? An estimated 90% of global biodiversity loss and water stress stem directly from resource extraction and processing to supply humanity's cravings. Even more disturbingly, about one third of all food produced is simply thrown away, while nearly 800 million people face chronic hunger. The lunacy of these diametrically opposed realities demands moral outrage.

Our infatuation with the disposable culture of planned obsolescence has spawned entire islands of swirling plastic detritus in our oceans that now outweigh ecosystems' total biological mass. Toxic e-waste graveyards scatter our globe like radioactive lesions. Meanwhile the greenhouse gas emissions generated by our throwaway bacchanal are fuelling climatic destabilization threatening both ecosystem resiliency and food security. Unabated, this Molochian consumption will deliver us unto an uninhabitable wasteland of our own profligate creation.

The hour grows desperately late for course correction. SDG 12 sagaciously implores us to "ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns" by slashing waste generation through policies ushering in a visionary circular economy. Upending the antiquated linear model of extraction-consumption-disposal, circularity envisions products intelligently designed for perpetual lifecycles—components meticulously recovered, refurbished and recycled ad infinitum.

Nations must embrace aggressive legislative and economic measures incentivizing closed-loop industrial ecosystems aligned with ecological constraints, holistically minimizing waste, pollution and environmental degradation. Extended producer responsibility levies, for example, could compel corporations to assume full accountability for their products' full material lifecycles.

Yet decoupling economic progress from resource depletion and environmental despoliation ultimately demands a fundamental cultural reorientation. We must reject the pernicious doctrine of unbridled consumerism preached so zealously by the marketing-industrial complex. Simplicity,minimalism, collaborative consumption, and a renaissance of the sharing economy all augur an emancipatory path from materialism's hollow solipsism.

Only by untethering ourselves from avaricious excess can we liberate human creativity and ingenuity to construct a replenishing, equitable, and truly sustainable political economy. The SDG clarion call reminds us that our ethics, lifestyles and socioeconomic paradigms stand at an existential crossroads. To salvage our species' dignity and preserve a thriving planet, we must resolutely overthrow the gospel of compulsive consumerism and embrace the regenerative wisdom of enough.
