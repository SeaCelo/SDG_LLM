Here is an academic article on SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) written from the perspective of Richard Littlejohn:

The Nanny State Strikes Again with Its Responsible Consumption Codswallop  

You won't believe the latest barminess from the eco-loonies and their Sustainable Development Goals. SDG 12 calls for "responsible consumption and production patterns." What a load of old codswallop! The environmental nutters and their obedient lapdogs in the Civil Service want us all eating GRUEL while businesses bend over backwards meeting ridiculous "sustainable" targets.

Let's start with this obsession over food waste. I'm sure we've all chucked out a manky old cabbage or two, but the zealots act like it's a crime against humanity. They trot out horrifying statistics about tons of perfectly good grub going to landfills. Well la-di-da! Are we really supposed to finish that weeks-old Chinese takeaway congealing at the back of the fridge?

Then there's all this tosh about "sustainable materials management" and "sustainable procurement practices." Essentially big bullyboy bureaucrats dictating what companies can and can't produce or buy based on some arbitrary tick-box criteria. Jobs, investment, and economic growth be damned! The only thing that matters to these eco-freaks is their deranged vision of a hairshirt-wearing, granola-munching society.

They're especially gunning for anything vaguely pleasurable - fizzy drinks, snacks, affordable clothing. Apparently these "non-essential" items are the root of all evil. Tell that to a hard-working family that fancies a cheap treat now and then. Of course, the out-of-touch toff framers of these goals won't be foregoing their artisanal cheese or claret.

Have you seen the miles of newspeak and statistical mumbo-jumbo buttressing the "consumption and production" goal? It's all part of the relentless accretion of rules, codes and targets designed to control every aspect of our lives for some nebulous "greater good." Well I for one am fed up with being bossed around by these puritanical parasites.

We're constantly being bombarded with sanctimonious messaging about over-consumption, recycling, and "living sustainably." Enough already! We get it! Most of us already do our bit without needing to be nagged incessantly by the Guardianista types. Let me decide what I want to consume or what's "essential", thank you very much. That's what a free society is all about.

Of course, individual choice and freedom are anathema to this omnipotent, purse-lipped establishment hellbent on micro-managing every aspect of our existence. They want us waddling around in scratchy homespun togs, nibbling on insect flour and recycled dishwater. Well I'll be damned if I'll surrender my beef and bathroom tissue just to appease the virtue-signalling eco-numbskulls. This is 21st century Britain, not Maoist China!

In summary, SDG 12 represents another deeply sinister and misguided attempt by out-of-touch elites to dictate how we should consume and produce while enriching themselves in the process. No doubt companies that can navigate the maze of sustainability reporting will be laughing all the way to the bank. The rest of us hard-working schlubs, however, will just get lumbered with higher prices, less choice, and infinitely more meddling. Time to put a stop to this "responsible consumption" codswallop before it goes too far. Let's bin it before they come for our bacon sarnies next!
