Here is a long academic article about SDG 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production, written as if by the satirical novelist Carl Hiaasen:

Listen up, folks. We've got ourselves a doozy of a situation down here in the sweaty armpit of America. Our beloved state of Florida is sinking faster than a gator getting torn apart by spiral-horned rutters while an army of slobbering land crabs nips at its tail. And why, you ask? Because we can't seem to get a grip on this whole "responsible consumption and production" thing. 

It's like we're all taking stupid pills around here. You look at the way we consume and produce junk, and it's a certifiable clown show. We've got households throwing out enough food to feed a small country, while kids on the same street go hungry. Plastic crap is choking our oceans and making its way into the bellies of manatees. Our landfills are towering higher than Miami high-rises, filled with useless doodads that nobody needs.

And that's just the half of it. When it comes to production, we're like a herd of rabid manufacturers, cranking out more cheap, disposable trinkets and waste than you can shake a stick at. It's like we're hopped up on bath salts and unbridled greed, with no concept of sustainability or conservation. 

We blast mine pits into the earth like we're making a quarry omelette, stripping the landscape barer than a drunk getting hosed off outside Señor Frog's. Our factories belch poison into the rivers that make the walls of Chernobyl look like kindergarten fingerpaints. And when it comes to energy? Fuhgeddaboudit! We're burning up dinosaur sludge like there's no tomorrow, choking the atmosphere with more greenhouse gases than a herd of farting mastodons.

Now I'm not naive enough to think that we can just up and abandon our disposable lifestyles cold turkey. We're Americans, damn it – our entire economy depends on churning out legions of useless plastic knickknacks and rapidly obsolete electronics that get chucked into the eco-mulcher a year later. And woe betide the politician who tries to take away our God-given right to buy vats of limited-edition Star Wars collector's cups or life-size resin garden gnomes adorned with the Budweiser logo.

But there has to be a better way, right? Some sort of balance where we can enjoy our crass consumer tendencies without stamping out every acre of wetlands from here to Timbuktu? Where we exercise a little restraint and common sense when it comes to production and waste? Where we stop stuffing our faces with endless buckets of hormone-laced factory chicken until our angrily distended guts look like overstuffed water balloons?

I'm not asking for miracles here, people. Just a little more thought put into the things we buy and the companies we support. More recycling, more composting, more repurposing. An end to this brain-dead obsession with always having the newest model and upgrading our lives into a perpetual landfill. A dash of wisdom when it comes to industrial practices that spew toxins into the environment. And maybe – just maybe – enough foresight to ensure this swampy jewel we call Florida doesn't wind up submerged under ten feet of putrid sludge.

Does that really sound so crazy? Looking out for the future of this peninsula full of dangerously inbred fauna? Treating our one and only home with a smidgeon of respect instead of greedily strip-mining it into oblivion? I don't think it's too much to ask that we embrace a little more sustainable living and responsible stewardship of our resources.

Of course, this is Florida we're talking about here. The state where rational thought goes to curl up and die in a dimly-lit back alley. The chances of us getting our collective act together on the responsible consumption and production front are about as likely as my old buddy Skink trading in his arm-mounted Kukoho for a nice cardigan and a bowl of chicken salad.  

So I'll leave you with this – next time you're plopping your keester into a gas-guzzling Hummer stretch-limo to motor down to the all-you-can-swallow industrial shrimp buffet, think for just a second about your ecological impact. Ask yourself if we really need to be wiping out the planet at such an alarming rate. Because if current trends continue unabated, in 50 years the only life left in the Everglades is going to be the skeeters and a handful of reptiles too stubborn and scaly to croak.

And trust me – you do not want to share your Golden Years with nothing but ill-tempered alligators and bloodsucking mosquito swarms for company. Not in these humidity levels, you don't. Now go forth and sin a little less, would ya? This used to be one hell of a nice place before we messed it all up.
