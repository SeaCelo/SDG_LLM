Sustainable Development Goal 12 (SDG 12), focused on ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns, is a fundamental priority for the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID). Through various programs and initiatives, AECID has taken a leading role in promoting more responsible consumption and production patterns globally.

In our interventions, we have worked closely with governments, international organizations, and local stakeholders to address the challenges inherent in transitioning to a circular economy. A key focus has been promoting efficiency in the use of natural resources, addressing the unsustainable extraction of raw materials, and minimizing waste throughout value chains.

In this regard, we have supported pilot projects in several partner countries, focusing on the implementation of eco-design practices and product life cycle analysis. These initiatives have demonstrated the potential to significantly reduce the environmental footprint of consumer goods while maintaining their market competitiveness.

We have also worked to promote circular business models that incorporate reuse, recycling, and material recovery at the end of their lifecycle. These approaches not only mitigate environmental impacts but also create economic opportunities and alternative sources of income for local communities.

In the realm of responsible consumption, AECID has led awareness and education campaigns targeting both consumers and producers. These initiatives aim to encourage informed decision-making, promote more sustainable products and services, and foster consumption patterns that are more conscious and environmentally respectful.

A critical aspect of our approach has been strengthening local capacities and empowering communities. Through training programs and knowledge transfer, we have worked to develop technical skills and promote best practices in sustainable consumption and production.

It is important to highlight that our interventions extend beyond environmental considerations to address the social and economic dimensions of sustainable development. We have placed special emphasis on creating green jobs, promoting gender equity, and including vulnerable groups in the transition to a circular economy.

In summary, AECID has taken a proactive role in implementing SDG 12 through a multidimensional approach encompassing awareness-raising, education, capacity development, and the promotion of innovative business models. Our goal is to contribute to creating a more sustainable future where consumption and production align with the planet's limits and ensure greater resilience and well-being for all communities.
