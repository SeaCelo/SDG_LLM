Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), drafted from the perspective of the late economist Zvi Griliches:

The Crucial Role of Technological Change in Achieving Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns

By Zvi Griliches

The 12th Sustainable Development Goal adopted by the United Nations calls for ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns. While the specific targets involve laudable objectives like sustainable management of natural resources, reduction of food waste, and environmentally sound waste management, I would argue that truly achieving this goal hinges fundamentally on our ability to spur technological change and innovation.

Throughout economic history, one observes a recurring pattern - as new technologies emerge and diffuse, their productivity-enhancing effects allow for more efficient utilization of resources in meeting consumption needs. The steam engine, mechanized manufacturing, the combustion engine, and myriad other innovations all represented vectors that decoupled economic growth from commensurate increases in resource depletion and environmental degradation. By relentlessly improving production processes and resource efficiency, new technologies raise the productive capacity of economies in a way that alleviates pressures on the natural environment.

My own research into the sources of productivity growth has highlighted the primacy of technological change, finding it to be the principal driver as opposed to conventional inputs like capital and labor. While innovation often faces institutional barriers and lags in diffusion, its impacts are both profound and indispensable for sustainable long-run growth. In the context of SDG 12, pursuing technological frontiers holds immense potential for fostering more sustainable patterns of consumption and production.

In agriculture for instance, innovations like precision farming, vertical cultivation, drought and pest-resistant seed varieties, and sustainable irrigation technologies are already showing promise in boosting yields and nutritional output while moderating resource depletion. Similarly, advances in recycling processes, product lifecycle management, industrial ecology, and closed-loop manufacturing systems are progressively "dematerializing" economic output in advanced economies. But greater R&D investments are imperative to propel these developments and scale their adoption worldwide.

Recognizing technology's capacity to shape long-term trajectories, policymakers must prioritize fostering innovation ecosystems that lower barriers to research and commercialization. This entails robust intellectual property protections, enhancing human capital through STEM education, improving access to risk capital for entrepreneurs, and strategically incentivizing research aligned with sustainability goals. Public-private research partnerships and incubators attuned to global challenges can steer innovation in socially beneficial directions.

Of course, new technologies themselves are no panacea and often present risk tradeoffs. Their development and deployment must be accompanied by complementary policies that price environmental externalities appropriately and diffuse benefits equitably across socioeconomic strata. But given innovation's unparalleled leverage over humanity's ecological footprint, steering its awesome potential towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals is not just pragmatic - it is imperative for our collective future on this planet.

In the words of my esteemed colleague Robert Solow, "You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics." Let that not be said for the sustainability age. Fostering innovation that enhances how we produce and consume is the highest value investment we can make towards charting a path of long-term, equitable, and environmentally sustainable economic development.
