Here is a detailed response as if written by Gwynne Dyer about Sustainable Development Goal 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production:

The drive toward ever-increasing consumption has been the economic engine powering the developed world's prosperity for decades. But like overworked machinery, that engine is now wheezing and clanking, its parts over-stressed and wearing thin. We have bent the planet's natural systems to serve our insatiable hunger for more, but in so doing we have pushed the Earth's regenerative capacity to its limits. Responsible consumption and production is not an optional course correction - it is an existential necessity if we hope to avoid an environmentally-catalyzed economic collapse and societal turmoil on an unprecedented scale.

The hard truth is that the prevailing "take-make-waste" model of economic activity is simply unsustainable. We are depleting the world's natural resource stocks at a rate up to 50% faster than they can be regenerated. The deadweight of our garbage and emissions strains the biosphere's assimilative buffers. Across the board, our impacts overshadow the ability of natural systems to absorb them and restore balance. It sets the stage for a cascading failure of the ecological services upon which our prosperity - indeed, our very civilization - depends.

Consider our rapidly dwindling stocks of fertile soil, being eroded and nutrients depleted through unsustainable agricultural practices at over 10 times the rate of renewal. Almost a third of the world's arable land has already been lost to soil degradation driven by our lack of responsibility. At our current trajectory, we face the stark prospect of losing over 90% of soil crop yields by 2050, with devastating impacts on global food security. 

Our ravenous appetite for new resources and disposable goods has already stripped the easily accessible, high-quality mineral and fossil fuel deposits. We now labor to extract lower-grade, less efficient resources from ever more remote, fragile or hazardous locales at far greater environmental cost. We treat the world's precious water resources as an infinite supply rather than the gravely threatened commodity it is rapidly becoming.  

And let us not gloss over the air pollution crisis smothering many of the world's great cities, shortening millions of lives each year. The plumes of carcinogenic particulates, sickening smogs, and greenhouse gas emissions choking these urban centers are but concentrated manifestations of the systemic profligacy coursing through the modern production system.

There can be no prosperous tomorrow if we forever raid and degrade the natural capital upon which our well-being relies. The wasteful culture of unconstrained consumption pushing us toward ecological collapse must be upended and transformed. We must urgently shift course and revolutionize the very foundations of economic life toward a circular model that eliminates waste through intelligent system design.

This demands moving beyond narrow incrementalism and lip-service toward an integrated commitment to sustainable production patterns across the entire life cycle of products. It means embracing fundamental changes - extending product life through better design, prioritizing renewable and recycled inputs, detoxifying production processes, shifting to renewable energy, empowering consumers with better information and incentives to make responsible choices. It requires an uncompromising intolerance of obsolescence and disposability as virtues.

This is more than just an environmental agenda - it strikes at the core ideology driving modern capitalism's expansionist model of perpetual growth. To make this transition, we must confront the entrenched interests and perverse incentives perpetuating unsustainable practices. Those profiting from the incremental destruction of our natural inheritance will resist being cut off from that lucrative resource flow.  

But clinging to these old patterns is simply a road to ruin. If we fail to summon the courage and foresight to transform our economic system into one that operates within the planet's boundaries, that system will ultimately be transformed by scarcity, deprivation and conflict in ways far more destructive. We can choose to manage that transformation through responsible policies, or be driven to chaotic adaptation by forces beyond our control.

In the end, embracing sustainable consumption and production is about recognizing the hard limits defining our existence on this small planet. It forces a reconciliation with nature's constraints and a new conception of prosperity decoupled from endless material growth. Our future well-being depends not on vainly trying to outrun those limits, but in learning to live intelligently within them. It won't be easy, but our survival depends on making that profound mental leap.
