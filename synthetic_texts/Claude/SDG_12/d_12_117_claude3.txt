Here goes, an academic article on SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production, written from the perspective of Jeremy Clarkson:

Responsible Consumption and Production? What a load of rotten codswallop dreamt up by a bunch of woolly-headed environmentalist baboons. You're telling me I have to stop guzzling petrol and spewing CO2 out the exhaust of my Lamborghini Aventador just because some tree-humping activists say so? Fat chance.   

Look, I'm a simple man. I like things that go vroom vroom at unnecessary speeds while drinking enough dinosaur juice to drown a blue whale. Call me old-fashioned, but there's something delightfully Neanderthal about firing up a massive 6.5L V12 engine and watching it convert fossil fuels into glorious noise and smoke. It's the circle of life, really. Jurassic plants and animals died millions of years ago so I could have a jolly good time melting the Arctic ice caps one tyre screech at a time. You're welcome, polar bears.  

But these environmentalist funbuttons won't rest until they've banned the internal combustion engine and forced us all into silence-mobiles powered by unicorn farts and obedience. Sustainable management of natural resources? I haven't got the faintest what that means, but it sounds utterly beastly. As if I'd ever reduce my consumption or recycle any of the tons of plastic, metal and hazardous waste generated whenever I upgrade to a newer,より強力な温室効果ガス放出マシン every year.  

And this rubbish about promoting sustainable practices across the supply chain? You mean I'm meant to feel guilty about the environmental devastation caused by my Patagonian hormone-injected steak that gets flown 8,000 miles just so I can have a nice rare treat? Or the slash and burn deforestation required to grow my morning coffee that I only drink because Starbucks uses enough milk to stop several small villages? I think not.

Now don't get me wrong, I'm not a monster. I want to leave plenty of oil and coal in the ground for future generations to enjoy. And when the planet is a sputtering, toxic mess in a few decades, at least we can say we had a hellishly good time turning night into day with our V8s while we could. Standards of living, what standards of living? Breathing fresh air is overrated if you ask me.  

In summary, SDG 12 can get firmly stuffed up the exhaust pipe as far as I'm concerned. Sustainable consumption? That's for the pious and the weak. Give me overindulgence and damn the consequences. If the planet dies, it dies. At least I went out with a roar from my 700 horsepower, twin-turbo, ecosystem-collapsing V8. Tally ho!
