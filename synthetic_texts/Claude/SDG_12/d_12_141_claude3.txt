Here is a detailed, comprehensive response presented as a long academic article on SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), written from the perspective of acclaimed author Mitch Albom:

The Tug Between Want and Need: Humanity's Quest for Sustainable Consumption

By Mitch Albom 

As I walk through the aisles of my neighborhood grocery store, I'm bombarded by an overwhelming array of choices. Rows upon rows of glistening fruits and vegetables, a dizzying selection of cheeses, an entire aisle devoted to chips and crackers. My mind whirls in consumerist delight - until a thought interrupts the euphoria: Is any of this really necessary? 

This simple question tugs at the thread of one of our species' most complex quandaries - the balance between want and need. We live in a world of hyper-consumption, where advertising convinces us that more is always better, that true happiness lies in constant acquisition. Yet at what cost do these materialistic indulgences come?

The path of excessive and irresponsible consumption has wrought disastrous consequences for our planet. We have depleted natural resources, polluted air and water sources, and generated unconscionable amounts of waste through our disposable mindset. The facts are sobering: if the world's population consumed like the average American, we would need nearly five Earths to sustain our resource use.

But there is hope. The 12th Sustainable Development Goal put forth by the United Nations offers a path forward, a crucial objective to "ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns." It recognizes that transforming our relationship with consumption is pivotal to alleviating poverty, protecting the environment, and creating a world of prosperity for all.

At its core, SDG 12 challenges us to reframe our personal and societal value systems, to redefine what true wealth and success mean beyond just material possessions. It beckons us to live with intention, conscious of the impact our choices have on people and the planet.  

This shift begins with each of us examining our consumption habits through a critical lens. Do we really need that new outfit, that latest gadget? Could we opt for a pre-owned item instead of buying new? By embracing concepts like reducing waste, recycling, and reusing products, we take tangible steps toward sustainability. 

But the responsibility doesn't solely rest on individual shoulders. Companies and industries must radically rethink their production processes, adopting circular economic models that minimize resource use and waste generation. They must design products for longevity, repair, and effective recycling at their end of life.

Governments, too, play a vital role through environmentally-conscious policies, incentivizing sustainable practices, and holding corporations accountable. Effective legislation can phase out harmful fossil fuel subsidies, regulate pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, and drive innovation in clean technologies.

Perhaps most critically, achieving the SDG around responsible consumption requires a profound philosophical and cultural shift - away from the mantra of endless growth and toward an ethos of sufficiency. We must recognize that true abundance isn't found in material surplus, but in cultivating what matters most: healthy communities, strong relationships, and an enduring reverence for nature's splendor.

As an author, I find power in words and stories. The path to SDG 12 needs a new narrative, one that inspires us to be conscious consumers while celebrating the beauty of living with less. A tale that reminds us that the most valuable things in life aren't found on shelves, but within ourselves and our shared humanity.

In my novels, characters often face pivotal moments that shape their life's journey. Humanity now stands at such a crossroads. Will we continue ravaging the Earth through careless consumption? Or will we rise to the challenge, embracing a way of life that uplifts both people and planet?

The choice, as always, is ours. But if we can find the courage to tread the road of sustainability - to live with intention, conscious of our impact - perhaps we can write a new story for generations to come. One of renewal, reverence, and a rediscovery of what it means to truly live in abundance.
