This is Sylvia Schur, Professor of Sustainable Development Studies at the University of Aalborg, here to share my perspectives on SDG 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production. As a lifelong advocate for sustainability, I find this Goal to be pivotal in reshaping our relationship with the planet's finite resources.

At its core, SDG 12 calls for a radical transformation in how we produce and consume goods and services. Our current linear economic model, which extracts resources, makes products, and disposes of them after use, is unsustainable and exacerbates environmental degradation, resource depletion, and climate change. We urgently need to transition towards a circular economy that maximizes resource efficiency, eliminates waste, and perpetuates the cyclical use of materials.

A promising initiative in this regard is the Circularity Gap Reporting Initiative, a public-private coalition that measures the world's circularity gap – currently at a mere 8.6%, meaning we only reuse or recycle 8.6% of the minerals, fossil fuels, metals, and biomass that enter our economy each year. Bridging this gap requires innovative business models like product-as-a-service, where companies retain ownership of products and customers pay for their use, incentivizing durability and recyclability.

One company leading by example is Philips, which has implemented a "circular revenue" model for its professional medical equipment, enabling hospitals to use their products through a subscription service. When equipment reaches its end-of-use, Philips retrieves, refurbishes, and redeploys it, thereby reducing raw material extraction and waste.

Responsible consumption patterns are equally crucial for SDG 12's success. We must shift mindsets away from overconsumption and disposability, embracing conscious consumerism through practices like buying second-hand, repairing and repurposing products, and favoring sustainable goods and services. Government policies can drive this transition through measures like Extended Producer Responsibility laws, which hold manufacturers accountable for the entire lifecycle of their products, incentivizing eco-design and recycling.

A noteworthy initiative is the Plastic Waste Makers Index, which ranks the world's top polluting corporations based on their global plastic waste footprint. By increasing transparency and accountability, such indexes empower consumers to make informed choices and pressure companies to reduce their environmental impact.

Moreover, SDG 12 is inextricably linked to other SDGs, underscoring the integrated nature of the 2030 Agenda. Sustainable consumption and production patterns can significantly contribute to climate action (SDG 13) by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from resource extraction, manufacturing, and waste management. It also supports life on land (SDG 15) by minimizing deforestation, land degradation, and biodiversity loss associated with unsustainable resource use.

In conclusion, achieving SDG 12 requires a collective effort from all stakeholders – governments, businesses, civil society, and individuals. By embracing circular economy principles, fostering responsible consumption habits, and leveraging the power of transparency and accountability, we can decouple economic growth from environmental degradation and build a sustainable future for generations to come.
