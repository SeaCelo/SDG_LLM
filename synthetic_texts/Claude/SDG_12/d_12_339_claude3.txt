Camões - Instituto da Cooperação e da Língua's analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

The pursuit of sustainable consumption and production patterns lies at the heart of Sustainable Development Goal 12, a critical imperative in our collective journey towards a more equitable and prosperous world. As a global community, we find ourselves at a pivotal crossroads, where the insatiable demands of our modern society collide with the finite resources of our planet. The consequences of unchecked overconsumption and unsustainable production practices have manifested in the form of environmental degradation, resource depletion, and the exacerbation of socioeconomic inequalities.

In this context, SDG 12 emerges as a clarion call for a paradigm shift, urging nations, industries, and individuals to reevaluate their consumption and production patterns. Central to this goal is the concept of the circular economy, a regenerative model that challenges the traditional linear approach of "take, make, waste." By embracing circularity, we can decouple economic growth from resource extraction and environmental degradation, unlocking a future where prosperity and sustainability coexist harmoniously.

Portugal, a nation renowned for its rich cultural heritage and commitment to international cooperation, has taken commendable strides in aligning its policies and initiatives with SDG 12. The country's National Strategy for the Circular Economy, launched in 2017, serves as a blueprint for transitioning towards a more resource-efficient and sustainable economic model. This comprehensive strategy encompasses a range of measures, including incentives for eco-innovation, promotion of industrial symbiosis, and the development of robust waste management systems.

One notable initiative under this strategy is the "Valorpneu" program, a pioneering effort to manage end-of-life tires in a sustainable manner. By fostering collaboration between tire manufacturers, importers, and waste management entities, this program has successfully diverted millions of tires from landfills, repurposing them for various applications, including energy recovery and the construction of sports facilities. This exemplifies the principles of the circular economy, where waste is transformed into a valuable resource, minimizing environmental impact and maximizing economic benefits.

Furthermore, Portugal has made significant strides in promoting sustainable public procurement practices, recognizing the immense potential of government spending to drive sustainable consumption and production patterns. The country's National Strategy for Green Public Procurement, introduced in 2020, mandates the integration of environmental and social criteria into public procurement processes. This not only ensures that government expenditure supports sustainable products and services but also creates a ripple effect, encouraging private sector entities to adopt more sustainable practices to remain competitive in the public procurement market.

Complementing these policy initiatives, Portugal has actively engaged in international cooperation and knowledge-sharing efforts to advance SDG 12 on a global scale. Through its participation in platforms such as the United Nations Environment Programme's International Resource Panel, Portugal has contributed to the development of methodologies and tools for assessing resource efficiency and promoting sustainable consumption and production patterns worldwide.

While these efforts are commendable, it is crucial to acknowledge that the journey towards responsible consumption and production is an ongoing and multifaceted endeavor. Addressing systemic challenges such as overconsumption, resource depletion, and waste generation requires a holistic approach that encompasses technological innovation, policy reforms, and a fundamental shift in societal attitudes and behaviors.

To this end, Portugal must continue to prioritize education and awareness-raising campaigns that foster a culture of mindful consumption and responsible production. Empowering individuals, communities, and businesses with the knowledge and tools to make informed choices and adopt sustainable practices is paramount. Additionally, strengthening cross-sectoral collaboration and public-private partnerships can catalyze the development and scaling of innovative solutions that drive resource efficiency, waste minimization, and the adoption of sustainable business models.

Moreover, as a global leader in international cooperation, Portugal has a unique opportunity to leverage its expertise and influence to support developing nations in their pursuit of sustainable consumption and production patterns. Through capacity-building initiatives, technology transfer, and the sharing of best practices, Portugal can play a pivotal role in enabling other countries to leapfrog traditional development pathways and embrace more sustainable alternatives.

In conclusion, Sustainable Development Goal 12 is a call to action that resonates across all sectors and societies. By embracing responsible consumption and production patterns, we can create a future where economic prosperity is not achieved at the expense of environmental degradation or social inequalities. Portugal's efforts in aligning its policies and initiatives with this goal serve as a testament to its commitment to sustainable development and its leadership in international cooperation. However, the journey towards a truly sustainable and circular economy requires unwavering dedication, continuous innovation, and a collective shift in mindsets and behaviors. Only through a concerted and collaborative effort can we ensure that our consumption and production patterns are aligned with the principles of sustainability, enabling us to bequeath a thriving planet to future generations.
