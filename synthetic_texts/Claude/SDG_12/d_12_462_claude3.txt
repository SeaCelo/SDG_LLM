Here is a detailed newspaper article about Sustainable Development Goal 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) from the perspective of Barron's:

Wasteful Consumption Threatens Profits and Planet  
By the Barron's Investigative Unit

In the relentless quest for growth, many corporations have placed shortsighted emphasis on boosting consumption at all costs. But this unsustainable path is proving disastrous for the bottom line and for the very future of business itself.

Overconsumption of finite resources combined with the generation of excessive waste is quickly depleting the natural capital that underpins the global economy. The United Nations estimates that if the world's population consumed at the rate of the average American, we would need the regenerative capacity of over four planet Earths. This is obviously impossible to achieve.

Investors would be wise to scrutinize their portfolios for companies exposed to natural resource risks from unsustainable production methods and waste management practices. The economic consequences of unchecked resource depletion are staggering - the UN estimates the cost of natural resource underpinning at over $7 trillion annually. And that's just the beginning.

The exploding tide of plastic waste is a prime example of shortsighted industrial practice run amok. Humans produce over 300 million tons of plastic waste each year, with an estimated $80-120 billion in economic losses from the plastic value chain. Microplastics are now detected in the deepest ocean trenches and highest peaks, imperiling the health of marine ecosystems that produce trillions in economic services.

Without concerted effort, plastic on course to outweigh fish in the ocean by 2050. This blatant market failure cries out for regulatory intervention. The European Union has instituted a tax on non-recycled plastic, and other sweeping bans and mandates loom. Corporations that fail to solve their plastic addictions through innovative redesign and responsible recovery systems are positioning themselves as dinosaurs destined for the waste bin of history.

Yet plastic is merely the tip of the wasteful berg. Electronics, clothing, food, construction materials - virtually every major industry is hemorrhaging value through inefficient production and disposable product design. The annual cost of managing global waste is expected to rise from $264 billion to $375 billion. This trend cannot persist without existential risks to countless businesses.

The economic case for transitioning to a "circular economy" underpinned by responsible consumption and production is now overwhelming. Companies that re-envision their business models around closed material loops, sharing platforms, product-service systems, and regenerative resources will unlock staggering efficiencies along with reduced risks, costs, and liabilities.

From Barron's investigations, we see innovative leaders across industries repositioning for this inevitable transition. Consider the apparel company pursuing zero-waste manufacturing and selling premium clothing as a durable service rather than disposable product. Or the tech giant incentivizing customers with trade-in rebates to circulate phones for refurbishment and recycling of components. Or the industrial conglomerate repurposing byproducts into new revenue streams while powering facilities with renewable energy.

While implementing circular economy practices presents financial and operational challenges, the risks of inaction are far greater given looming resource constraints and shifting regulatory landscapes. Investors must grill corporate executives on their progress toward SDG Target 12.6 - adopting sustainable practices and integrating sustainability information into their reporting cycle.

Ultimately, survival in the pivotal decades ahead will hinge on divorcing corporate growth from wasteful consumption of the planet's finite resources. Barron's analysis indicates the circular economy imperative emerging as the greatest commercial opportunity of the 21st century - catalyzing not only resource productivity but innovation across industries. For businesses, the path toward sustainable consumption and production is the only path forward.
