Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) from the perspective of Tina Dupuy:

Achieving Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns: A Radical Reckoning 

By Tina Dupuy

Our current mode of production and consumption is catastrophically unsustainable. Driven by the capitalist ethos of perpetual growth and profit maximization, we have become hopelessly addicted to a linear model of take-make-waste. The consequences of this flagrant disregard for environmental limits are laid bare before us: climate chaos, species extinction, resource depletion, toxic pollution, and suffocating landfills. Yet the powers that be remain shackled to this ecocidal system, tweaking around the edges while the planet burns. It's time for a radical reckoning.  

The logic of infinite growth is not merely flawed, it's delusional. We inhabit a closed system with hard planetary boundaries. Perpetual expansion is physically impossible on a finite planet with finite resources. Our reckless consumption is quite literally killing the Earth. Already we are overshooting the Earth's biocapacity by over 60% each year as we pillage resources faster than they can replenish. This overshoot is only deepening as the global consumer class explodes alongside an insatiable hunger for more stuff.

What we need is a profound re-orientation away from the mania of mindless consumerism towards an ethos of sustainability, sufficiency, and circularity. We must transform our linear, extractive industrial model into one guided by closed-loop cycles where waste is eliminated through assiduous reuse and recycling. Renewable energy and circular product design should become the norm, not the alternative. The throwaway culture where profit is privatized and ecological devastation is externalized must be dismantled.

This imperative for a circular economy coincides with a social transition towards more collaborative, shareable models of provision. Why own underutilized assets when you can share access through community platforms, tool libraries, and rental schemes? Such models enhance resource productivity by rationing existing stocks among a wider population of users. Yet our hyperconsumerist identity remains an obstacle - trapped in a perpetual cycle of wanting more, never feeling satiated no matter how much we accumulate. Breaking these affective attachments to materialism while cultivating more sustainable cultural narratives is vital.

Of course, let's not ignore how production in the Global North is predicated on the superexploitation of labor and resources in the Global South. The West has effectively outsourced its ecological sins and material footprint to the developing world. Transitioning towards more sustainable production methods cannot come at the expense of denying the Global South its rightful share of ecological space for dignified development. An equitable sharing of consumption opportunities within ecological limits is essential.

Progress on SDG 12 demands the holistic integration of environmental, social, and economic priorities. It is nonsensical to compartmentalize crises that are intrinsically interlinked. Rather than the siloed approach of segregated goals, we need systemic transformations acknowledging the interdependencies at play. With ecological impacts ricocheting across all facets of existence, the age of compartmentalization is over. What we need is a radical revision of our collective priorities and way of being.  

Incremental reforms and technofixes will only get us so far as long as the root causes remain unaddressed - capitalism's need for perpetual growth, a cultural pathology of overconsumption, socioeconomic injustice, and a delusional anthropocentrism that positions humanity as separate from nature. At stake is not only the environment, but the very survival of our species and our ethical coherence as a civilization. The pursuit of endless more has brought us to this precipice. It's time to embrace the radical courage of enough.
