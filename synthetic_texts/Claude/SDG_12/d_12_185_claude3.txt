Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 12 "Responsible Consumption and Production" in the provocative style of political cartoonist Ted Rall:

Conspicuous Consumption: Why SDG 12 is Doomed to Fail  

The UN's Sustainable Development Goal 12 calls for "responsible consumption and production patterns" by 2030. But let's be real – getting corporations and consumers to stop bingeing on Earth's finite resources is about as likely as America electing a supreme leader for life who wears whiteface and amuumuu. 

SDG 12 is well-intentioned virtue-signaling, nothing more. Its targets include achieving sustainable management of natural resources by 2030, halving global per capita food waste, and ensuring that people everywhere have "relevant information and awareness" about sustainable lifestyles. Good luck with that. 

Humans are hardwired to crave more stuff. Consumerism is every capitalist economy's raison d'etre. Corporations exploit our inner kids by generating constant demand through psychological marketing that creates artificial needs. We're hopeless addicts jonesing for the latest iPhone or oat milk latte or skinny jeans. To expect us to collectively go cold turkey is delusional.

Even those of us claiming to "live simply" fuel unsustainable production through every Amazon Prime order of hiking gear. First world environmental "awakening" reeks of bourgeois self-indulgence – a smug rationalization to keep consuming, just with a green-washed, ethically-sourced, eco-conscious sheen of faux sacrifice.

As for corporations, the profit motive will always trump environmental ethics. Sure, companies like Patagonia preach sustainability. But even they rely on overseas factories that exploit workers and pollute communities to make those chic $200 fleece pullovers. Meanwhile, fast fashion behemoths like Shein produce 1,000 new cheap pieces daily, fueling a toxic overconsumption cycle as Earth drowns in discarded clothing.

SDG 12 seeks to "decouple economic growth from environmental degradation." That's an oxymoron. Our entire global economy is predicated on extracting finite resources, exploiting cheap labor, and generating endless waste byproducts. Even "sustainable" companies leach off the same rapacious system for raw materials and energy.

So what's the answer? Top-down global behavior mandates overseen by a coalition of enlightened technocrats? A bottom-up mass movement of virtuous anti-materialist localism? A Marxist withering of capitalist excess? None of those are realistic given human nature and entrenched power structures.  

No, the ugly truth is that SDG 12 is wishful thinking. We'll burn through this planet's resources until the bitter end, leaving a depleted dystopia for whatever remains of humanity scraping by among the ashes. Conspicuous consumption forever, baby! At least we'll look good staggering towards extinction in those fly gender-neutral harem pants...
