Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) written from the perspective of David Frum:

The Moral Imperative of Sustainable Consumption and Production

By David Frum

The 12th Sustainable Development Goal set forth by the United Nations calls upon the world to "ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns." At first glance, this might not seem like the most emotionally resonant or inspiring of the 17 goals - it lacks the moral urgency of goals like ending poverty and hunger, achieving quality education, or promoting peace and justice. However, I would argue that SDG 12 in fact represents the socioeconomic taproot from which all other sustainable development efforts grow.

If humanity cannot radically reorient our patterns of consumption and production toward sustainability, the entire 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is built upon shifting sands. The insatiable global appetite for more and cheaper material goods - stoked and inflamed by the addictive dopamine hit of consumerism - lies at the heart of our climate crisis, our extinction crisis, our resource depletion crisis, and the unchecked accumulation of pollutants and waste in our air, water, and soil. The paradigm of consumption has become ravenous, gluttonous, and quite frankly immoral in its disregard for the wellbeing of future generations.  

We in the developed world, who represent just 16% of the global population, account for over three-quarters of global consumption expenditure. North Americans maintain lifestyles that require nearly 9 planets' worth of resources and waste sinks were the model replicated worldwide. And yet day by day, consumption escalates across the developing world as more countries ascend the ranks of the global middle class. Without a revolution in mindset and behavior, the foundations of sustainable development will crumble beneath the weight of humanity's footprint.

Some may protest that curtailment of consumption runs counter to the ethos of free market capitalism and economic growth. But this represents a myopic and dogmatic view. For economies are not legitimate ends unto themselves - they are means toward the higher end of promoting human flourishing within planetary boundaries. Unfettered growth in material consumption is not sustainable when it depletes the natural capital upon which all life and economic activity depends. It is an act of willful negligence toward posterity, mortgaging the future to inflate the present. Already we see the strains, with the global exploitation of resources outpacing the planet's rate of regeneration by over 50%.  

The need to decouple economic growth from intensifying consumption of finite raw materials is one of the core challenges of our age. A profound redesign lies before us, one that will test our ingenuity, ethics, and commitment to intergenerational responsibility. We must transition toward a circular economy with drastically increased resource productivity, phasing out disposable products and transitioning toward intensive reuse, recycling, and repurposing. We must apply life cycle assessments and sustainable procurement policies across industries. We must incentivize and popularize practices of repairing, remanufacturing, and product longevity over the designed obsolescence mentality that has predominated. Innovative business models like product-service systems, sharing economies, and digitization of goods will all play crucial roles. 

Most critically, this transition necessitates a revival of the norm of sufficiency over excess - of appreciating "enoughness." For too long we have been captive to the deception that more stuff equates to more fulfillment. We've confused luxuries with necessities, privileges with rights. In doing so, we have commodified and hollowed out so many of the deeper sources of eudaimonic satisfaction - community, meaning, integrity, relationships, leisure pursuits, creativity, continual learning - valuing them only insofar as they facilitate greater consumption or accumulation.  

The spiritual poverty of such hyper-consumerism represents a profound market failure. Recalibrating our psyches toward sufficiency and non-material sources of flourishing doesn't make us poorer - it frees us from the hedonic treadmill of infinite appetite. Buddhist leaders were wiser by far than the high priests of capitalism when it comes to lasting happiness.

I do not make this case for sustainable consumption lightly or with any punitive spirit. It will require enormous sacrifice, perseverance, and a reorientation of our collective priorities. Nobody is more cognizant than I of our human capacity for self-justification, rationalization, and motivated reasoning when it comes to defending familiar comforts and behaviors. Yet there is no evading the hard truth: Our very future hangs in the balance. To avert catastrophe and pass on a thriving world to posterity, we simply must consume and produce in harmony with nature's limits and the rights of future people everywhere.

Herculean as the challenge appears, rejecting it consigns us to a fate of unendurable psychic pain. For what anguish could possibly exceed that of good parents squandering their children's inheritance through indolence and self-deception? The scope of SDG 12's ambition gives me hope - even its audacious existence within the 2030 Agenda points toward a profound shift in the human spirit, an evolutionary leap in our self-conceptualization as a species.

In rising to this challenge, we must become something more than masters of production and engineers of consumption. We must awaken to what it means to be terrestrial civilizations - members and tenants, not dominants, of this wondrously biodiverse planetary household. There is no truer path toward the enlightenment of sustainability than remembering our rightful place in the family of all life.
