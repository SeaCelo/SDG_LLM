Here is a detailed academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) as if written by the late economist Walter E. Williams:

Sustainable Consumption and Production: A Free Market Perspective

As economists, we pride ourselves on taking a dispassionate, analytical view - dissecting issues through the lens of incentives, tradeoffs, and unintended consequences. So when we examine the clarion call of SDG 12 to "ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns," we must peel back the altruistic veneer and scrutinize it under the bright light of economic reasoning.

At the core of this Goal lies an implicit contempt for the individual sovereignty of producers and consumers in free markets. The bureaucratic architects behind these UN diktats appear to harbor the hubristic belief that a cadre of enlightened central planners can somehow impart consumption standards and dictate production methods superior to those shaped organically by market forces. Let's disabuse ourselves of such conceit.

The genius of free markets is that they harmonize the self-interests of countless economic actors through the diffuse feedback mechanism of prices. Rising prices for a commodity signal scarcity value, incentivizing consumers to conserve and producers to ramp up supply until an equilibrium is restored. No cumbersome Five Year Plans or heavy-handed regulation required.

Conversely, centralized efforts to repudiate these market signals by artificially capping consumption or micromanaging production processes are inevitably counterproductive boondoggles - distorting incentives, hamstringing innovation, breeding black markets, and immiserating the very souls they purport to uplift.

To illustrate this folly, let's consider just one of the subgoals under SDG 12: Achieving the "sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources" by 2030. Even putting aside the vapid definition of "sustainable" (sustainable for whom, by what metric, and for how long?), we can observe that private property rights and the profit motive have proven far more effective at motivating resource husbandry.

From mineral extraction to timber harvesting, it is those with a vested stake in the residual value of their assets who have every incentive to conserve resources judiciously while developing resource-multiplying technologies and conservation methods with alacrity. In contrast, common pool resources systematically succumb to the Tragedy of the Commons - with rationale actors overexploiting in a shortsighted scramble.

And yet the SDG Brain Trust arrogantly presumes to legislate "sustainable" production with zero accountability. Rather, it is the blistering accountability of profit-and-loss statements that separates the wheat of resource efficiency from the chaff of sanctimonious buzzwords. Unlike governments which can just confiscate more taxes when they overspend, private firms must internalize the cost of their waste or get Schumpeter's gale of "creative destruction."

As for the Goals' nebulous mandate to reduce waste through "sustainable" consumption, it only untethers demand further from any disciplining anchor in resource costs. When items are underpriced by fiat, it encourages more unearned consumption and attendant waste - severing the incentive for consumers to carefully husband resources.

In free markets, the price system harmoniously balances consumption and provision for future needs by apportioning resources over time through interest rates. Those who gratuitously consume today drive up prices slightly, incentivizing ever-more forbearance of consumption by pricing more people out of present indulgence.

None of this is to deny that excessive pollution from industry can constitute a legitimate "negative externality" that may call for clarifying property rights in certain instances. But such limited corrective measures are far afield from the SDG agenda's sweeping overreach of consumption control and production oversight through the blunt tools of bureaucratic mandates and coercive decrees.

So let us call this Goal what it is - a thinly-veiled pretext for enriching the governing class and consolidating economic power under a professional managing elite, subordinating free peoples to a tyranny of sustainable development experts. Free societies entertaining such shackles on their economic liberty should recall French economist Frederic Bastiat's caution about what is unseen: "The unintended consequences of intervention are a blessing for society from which it profits for all eternity."
