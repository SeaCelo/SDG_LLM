Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production, written from the perspective of renowned environmental activist and author George Monbiot:

The Devouring Dragon: Our Suicidal Cycle of Consumption

The greatest collective delusion gripping our species is the notion that infinite exponential growth can be sustained on a finite planet. We exist in a world of limited resources, yet our economic engine is a perpetual motion machine demanding an ever-increasing consumption of materials. This juggernaut of extraction, processing, use, and disposal fuels not just our complacency but all the environmental crises bearing down upon us—climate disruption, ecosystem destruction, resource depletion, pollution, extinction. With our appetites whetted for more and more stuff, we collectively become a devouring dragon, gorging ourselves into oblivion.

The concept of sustainable consumption and production patterns, embodied in the 12th Sustainable Development Goal, represents a radical break from this ecocidal trajectory. In a sane world, such a proposition would be blindingly self-evident. Yet our dominant political and economic ideologies are rooted in the delusion of perpetual growth, rendering the simple objective of living within planetary boundaries as a subversive act. We have normalized the monstrously abnormal.

Let us examine the sheer madness of our collective consumption binge. Every year, the world economy consumes over 100 billion tons of materials, a figure that has tripled since 1970 and could double again by 2050 under business-as-usual. The developed nations, with just one-sixth of the world's population, hoover up roughly half of global material use. A child born today in the rich world will be responsible for thirty times more consumption than one born in the poorest nations.  

Shockingly, only 8.6% of the whopping 92.8 billion tons of materials consumed annually are put back into service after disposal. We are surrendering to the cult of disposability, filling the land and seas with a toxic residue of waste. The cheap plastic choking our oceans is one appalling manifestation. Over 300 million tons are produced globally each year from fossil fuels, with a plastic waste footprint doubling roughly every 11 years. At our current trajectory, there will be more plastic than fish in the oceans by 2050.  

The materials economy is bound by the second law of thermodynamics—a reality we brazenly defy. High-quality materials are persistently degraded through extraction, processing, and disposal into lower quality, disordered waste. The entropy of our closed system accelerates with each product life cycle. In our desperate bid to stave off this reality, we resort to ever more extreme energy expenditures to access new resource deposits, compounding our existential quandary.

Our throwaway culture is rooted in the systematic creation of artificial needs through advertising and planned obsolescence. We have decoupled consumption from actual human thriving and planetary wellbeing. How did we become so entranced by mountains of superfluous junk? Why must we accept the preposterous premise that more is better, bigger is better, faster is better? 

Ultimately, our obsession with endless consumption represents a gaping existential void that no amount of material enoughness can satiate. We compensate for spiritual poverty with profligate acquisitiveness. Our status-seeking nature has been fatally hijacked by the corporate world's pernicious conflation of worth with wealth. Greed is no longer reviled as a vice but glorified as an operating principle. We are hostage to the insatiable hunger of Mammon.

The path forward requires courageously repudiating the cultural dogma of consumerism, embracing a new paradigm of sufficiency. We must distinguish needs from wants, prioritizing fulfillment over accumulation. Degrowth—the transition from wasteful, dissipative economic activity to qualitative improvement—offers a chance at redemption. Circular economic models that recapture and reuse all materials, eradicating the notion of waste, show the way.  

Ultimately, our fate hinges on humanity remembering its place within the miraculous thrumming of life on Earth. We must tame our dragon nature, lest it immolate the very living systems we depend upon. The SDGs offer a beacon towards reclaiming our rightful role as plainfolk members of the biosphere's permanent economy of nourishment and replenishment. The choice is ours: asphyxiate in our waste or breathe anew with humility and care for all life.
