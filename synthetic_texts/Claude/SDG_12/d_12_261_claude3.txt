Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production, written from the perspective of Michael C. Jensen, a renowned scholar of organizational theory, corporate governance, and ethics:

The imperative to establish sustainable consumption and production patterns represents one of the most profound challenges facing modern societies and organizations. Mirroring the broader market failures that have plagued capitalist systems, producers and consumers alike have persisted in value-destructive behaviors that jeopardize long-term value creation. Driven by shortsighted incentives and boundedly rational decision making, business entities have systematically externalized environmental and social costs onto broader stakeholder groups, while consumers have engaged in rampant overconsumption without accounting for natural resource constraints.

This dysfunctional dynamic has catalyzed the transgression of numerous planetary boundaries, compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. Rectifying this unsustainable trajectory necessitates a fundamental realignment of corporate purpose and individual consumption habits with the primacy of creating lasting value for society and the environment. We must overcome the separation thesis that has falsely balkanized economic, ecological, and social value creation as inherently orthogonal pursuits.

The crux of the issue resides in the pervasive presence of misaligned incentives across economic players. In the corporate sphere, decision-making processes have been warped by agency issues arising from the separation of ownership and control, coupled with faulty governance mechanisms that motivate managers to maximize short-term stock prices rather than focus on the long-term value of the firm. This fixation on short-term earnings has fueled the systemic externalization of costs related to greenhouse gas emissions, pollution, deforestation, and more onto society at large, representing a colossal failure of modern capitalism.

Furthermore, executive compensation schemes premised on readily manipulated accounting metrics like earnings per share have amplified this managerial myopia. To combat this affliction, we must embrace enlightened stakeholder theory and remake corporate governance to serve the interests of all critical stakeholders, including communities, the environment, and future generations.

On the consumption side, the ubiquity of materialistic value pursuits and rampant consumerism reflects a failure of individuals to internalize the environmental toll of their actions. Notions of welfare have been improperly constrained to the utility derived from market-based consumption, disregarding the deleterious impacts on shared natural resources and public goods. Hyperbolic discounting, present bias, and the constraining effects of social influences further perpetuate unsustainable consumption patterns.

Confronting these market failures will mandate a combination of regulatory innovation, organizational redesign, and new social scripts to realign individual decision-making with the fundamental objective of sustainability. We must establish robust pricing mechanisms and incentive structures to induce the complete internalization of social and environmental externalities, ensuring that all attendant costs are reflected in the production and consumption of goods and services.

However, such policy prescriptions will prove insufficient absent a broader societal reframing of the very purpose of the firm and the end goals that should guide human decision-making. Instead of the narrow shareholder primacy paradigm, companies must be redesigned around the central objective of creating multi-dimensional value that harmonizes economic priorities with environmental regeneration and social equity.

New governance models premised on stakeholder representation and extended accountability can facilitate this shift towards becoming valueism entities. Real-world examples like theebenï¿½re company structure that have operationalized this enlightened value creation paradigm should be carefully studied and scaled. Similarly, policy interventions like expanding disclosure requirements and corporate liability regimes to explicitly incorporate environmental and social impacts could catalyze such transformational change.

On the consumption side, redefining human welfare beyond the restrictive confines of GDP and incorporating the regenerative impacts on natural and social capitals is of paramount importance. Public awareness campaigns highlighting sustainable consumption patterns, coupled with behavioral "nudges" like default rules favoring responsible choices, could progressively reshape social norms and individual decision-making.

In essence, realizing the dream of sustainable consumption and production demands that we discard the fallacious theoretical underpinnings that have rationalized value-destructive conduct. By internalizing externalities, reforming governance structures, and reorienting human motivation systems, we can transcend the separatist maxims that have polluted our planet and societies. It is a colossal endeavor, but one that represents an existential imperative for preserving a flourishing future.
