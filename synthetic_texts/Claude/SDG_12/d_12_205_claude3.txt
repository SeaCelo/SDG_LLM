Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) as if written by the late economist Walter E. Williams:

The Quest for Sustainable Resource Use: Aligning Economic Liberty with Environmental Preservation 

As a stalwart defender of free market economics and limited government, I have often been critical of environmental policies that erode personal and economic freedoms through excessive taxation and regulation. However, I believe the globally agreed upon Sustainable Development Goal 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production - is an area where voluntary private stewardship can work in harmony with free market principles to promote resource sustainability.

At its core, SDG 12 seeks to "ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns" through measures such as reducing waste generation, improving resource efficiency, encouraging companies to adopt sustainable practices, and increasing consumer awareness. Too often, critics have painted this objective as anathema to capitalism, conjuring up images of oppressive eco-taxes and draconian production limits. But capitalism and conservation can be complementary aims.

The primary drivers of wasteful production and consumption are not the free market forces of supply and demand, but rather government distortions that obscure the true costs of resource depletion. Whether it is direct subsidies for extractive industries, loose environmental regulations that enable unchecked pollution, or tax policies that incentivize excessive consumption, government intervention creates an artificial disconnect between the private costs faced by businesses and consumers, and the very real societal costs of unsustainable practices.

In a truly free market with well-defined property rights and an unhampered pricing system, we would see more sustainable business models emerge organically. Rational economic actors, when faced with accurate price signals that capture all associated costs, will have greater incentives to conserve finite resources, invest in resource efficiency, minimize waste streams, and seek innovative production substitutes when depletion costs increase. We have already seen shining examples, from private wilderness conservancies to market-driven recycling and reuse initiatives.

Moreover, today's consumers are increasingly environmentally conscious and exerting their market power through boycotts, buycotts, and a willingness to pay premium prices for sustainable goods. Capitalism's profit motive incentivizes businesses to cater to these burgeoning green sensibilities. We are witnessing a flourishing of eco-entrepreneurship, with new businesses designing innovative products with lower environmental footprints to meet this demand.

Crucially, these sustainability trends are being driven by decentralized market forces and voluntary choices, not by heavy-handed regulation. The greatest threat to SDG 12's objectives are in fact the persisting government distortions that forestall accurate pricing and stifle entrepreneurial solutions for sustainable production and consumption.

As we strive for global resource sustainability, we must be wary of the siren song of command economics. Heavy-handed environmental edicts, punitive eco-taxes, production quotas, and bureaucratic oversight may achieve surface-level compliance, but such top-down diktats cannot instill the flexible, adaptive, and innovative spirit needed for true sustainability. Instead, we should focus on phasing out market-distorting subsidies, strengthening property rights frameworks to internalize costs, and fostering an economic environment conducive to the decentralized development of resource-efficient practices.

The quest for sustainable resource use must not come at the cost of economic liberty; it is through the powerful incentive structures of free markets and voluntary cooperation that we can harmonize environmental preservation with the wealth-generation so critical to human flourishing. With the right economic institutions, the noble aims of SDG 12 can be achieved through the concerted choices of consumers and the enterprising solutions of the private sector - not by subverting the free market, but by unleashing its latent potential for conservation through sustainability entrepreneurship.
