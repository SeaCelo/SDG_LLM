As one of the world's foremost humanitarian organizations, the International Red Cross recognizes the pressing need to address the global challenge of sustainable consumption and production patterns, as outlined in Sustainable Development Goal 12 (SDG 12). Our commitment to alleviating human suffering compels us to confront the inextricable link between unsustainable resource exploitation and the exacerbation of conflicts, displacement, and environmental degradation.

In our extensive field operations across diverse regions, we witness firsthand the devastating consequences of overconsumption, wasteful practices, and the relentless depletion of natural resources. Conflict zones are often characterized by disrupted supply chains, scarce resources, and the breakdown of waste management systems, leading to dire humanitarian crises. The strain on finite resources, coupled with the impacts of climate change, exacerbates existing vulnerabilities and heightens the risk of resource-driven conflicts.

Our analysis reveals alarming trends in resource consumption and waste generation, particularly in urbanized areas and regions affected by armed conflicts or natural disasters. The influx of displaced populations, combined with limited infrastructure and resources, strains waste management capacities, leading to the proliferation of informal settlements and the accumulation of hazardous waste. This toxic legacy not only poses immediate health risks but also perpetuates long-term environmental degradation, hindering sustainable recovery and development efforts.

Furthermore, our assessments underscore the disproportionate impact of unsustainable consumption patterns on marginalized communities and vulnerable populations. These groups often lack access to essential resources, such as clean water, sanitation, and energy, and bear the brunt of environmental degradation and resource scarcity. Women and children, in particular, are disproportionately affected, as they are frequently tasked with procuring scarce resources and managing household waste in precarious conditions.

To address these challenges, the International Red Cross recognizes the need for a multi-faceted approach that integrates sustainable consumption and production practices into our humanitarian operations and advocacy efforts. We are actively exploring innovative solutions to minimize our environmental footprint, promote resource efficiency, and foster sustainable livelihoods in the communities we serve.

One such initiative is our "Green Response" program, which aims to integrate sustainable practices into our emergency relief efforts. This includes deploying renewable energy solutions in field operations, promoting water conservation and waste minimization, and engaging local communities in sustainable waste management practices. By leading by example, we strive to demonstrate the feasibility and necessity of sustainable solutions, even in the most challenging humanitarian contexts.

Moreover, we are actively collaborating with local and international partners to develop comprehensive waste management strategies tailored to the unique challenges of conflict-affected and resource-constrained environments. These strategies encompass the entire waste lifecycle, from minimization and segregation to safe disposal and resource recovery. By leveraging our extensive network and operational expertise, we aim to facilitate knowledge sharing, capacity building, and the adoption of best practices in sustainable waste management.

Recognizing the inextricable link between sustainable resource management and conflict prevention, we are actively advocating for the integration of SDG 12 into peacebuilding efforts and post-conflict reconstruction strategies. Our engagement with policymakers, multilateral organizations, and local stakeholders emphasizes the criticality of adopting sustainable consumption and production patterns as a means to mitigate resource-driven tensions, promote environmental stewardship, and foster sustainable development.
