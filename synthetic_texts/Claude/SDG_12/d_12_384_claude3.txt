As the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, I am gravely concerned about the profound implications Sustainable Development Goal 12 (SDG 12) – Responsible Consumption and Production – holds for the global refugee crisis. The inextricable link between unsustainable resource exploitation, environmental degradation, and forced displacement demands urgent action.

The root causes of many conflicts that displace populations can be traced back to resource scarcity, competition for dwindling natural resources, and the adverse impacts of climate change. Prolonged droughts, desertification, and water stress have exacerbated tensions in already fragile regions, leading to violent clashes over arable land, water sources, and grazing grounds. The Lake Chad Basin region, for instance, has witnessed a staggering loss of over 90% of the lake's surface area due to unsustainable water management practices, contributing to the displacement of millions.

Furthermore, the extraction and unsustainable use of natural resources, such as minerals, oil, and timber, have fueled conflicts and human rights abuses in various regions. The Democratic Republic of the Congo's mineral wealth has been a curse, with armed groups vying for control over mining areas, displacing communities, and perpetuating cycles of violence. Similarly, the palm oil industry's rampant deforestation and land grabbing in Southeast Asia have disrupted indigenous communities' livelihoods and traditional ways of life.

As if these challenges were not daunting enough, the very existence of refugee camps and settlements poses significant environmental risks. The influx of large populations into confined areas can strain local resources, leading to deforestation, soil degradation, and water contamination. The Dadaab refugee complex in Kenya, for instance, has faced severe environmental challenges due to the unsustainable use of firewood for cooking and shelter construction, resulting in widespread deforestation and desertification.

Addressing SDG 12 is crucial in tackling the root causes of displacement and mitigating the environmental impacts of refugee situations. We must prioritize sustainable resource management, promoting circular economies, and transitioning towards renewable energy sources. This requires concerted efforts from governments, the private sector, and civil society to adopt sustainable production practices, reduce waste, and promote responsible consumption patterns.

Moreover, we must invest in building resilient communities and promoting sustainable livelihoods, particularly in areas prone to environmental shocks and resource conflicts. By empowering local populations with sustainable agricultural techniques, water management strategies, and alternative income-generating opportunities, we can reduce the vulnerability to displacement and foster self-reliance.

In refugee settings, we must prioritize eco-friendly solutions and promote environmental stewardship. This includes adopting renewable energy sources, such as solar panels and biogas digesters, to reduce reliance on firewood and minimize deforestation. Implementing sustainable waste management systems, promoting reforestation efforts, and engaging refugees in environmental conservation initiatives can mitigate the ecological footprint of refugee camps and settlements.

Achieving SDG 12 is not merely an environmental imperative; it is a humanitarian necessity. By addressing unsustainable consumption and production patterns, we can tackle the root causes of displacement, prevent environmental degradation, and build resilient communities capable of withstanding future shocks and stresses. It is a call to action that transcends borders and demands global solidarity, collective responsibility, and a unwavering commitment to sustainable development.
