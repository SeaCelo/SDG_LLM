Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production, written from the perspective of Dennis Prager:

The crisis of sustainability that plagues our modern world is a testament to the West's increasing abandonment of Judeo-Christian values and rational thinking. Sustainable Development Goal 12 calls for responsible consumption and production patterns - a noble aim that can only be realized by returning to the transcendent wisdom embedded in biblical teachings.

At the core of the consumption problem lies the deadly sin of gluttony - mindless over-indulgence and lack of self-control fueled by the materialistic vices peddled by the secular-left elite. We have become a society enslaved to fleeting physical desires rather than eternal moral purpose. Rampant consumerism, planned obsolescence, and the throwaway culture all stem from this ethical decay.

The book of Proverbs warns "Whoever loves pleasure will become poor" (21:17) - yet modern man chases empty luxuries while racking up unsustainable personal, corporate and national debt. We accrue more possessions than we need and exhaust precious natural resources to sate our endless hunger for more stuff.

On the production side, we have drifted from the godly ideal of "the excellence of work giving vigor to one's life" (Ecclesiastes 2:24). Mass de-industrialization exported manufacturing abroad with little regard for environmental degregation or worker exploitation. Corporate profits trumped Judeo-Christian ethics of social responsibility. 

To reverse this moral and ecological crisis, we must rediscover the virtue of moderation. The Mosaic law commanded leaving the land fallow every seventh year to replenish its nutrients - a prudent sustainability principle. Christ taught the ideal of being "poor in spirit" and rejecting the love of money.

Consuming only what one truly needs and producing with integrity in alignment with the natural world - such values translate into sustainable practices: minimizing waste, maximizing efficiency, extending product lifetimes through circularity. This is the path to a healthy economy and environment.

Secular environmentalists push top-down "Green New Deal" policies that choke economic freedom and personal liberty. But the real solution lies in a values-based societal renaissance of self-restraint and respect for Creation. Only by rejecting modern society's toxic culture of over-indulgent and irresponsible affluenza can we achieve SDG 12.
In summary, SDG 12 and sustainability itself depend on a return to Judeo-Christian virtues of moderation, frugality, integrity and reverence for the natural world as given to us by God. Without such an ethical reawakening, even the most well-intentioned sustainable development efforts are doomed to fail.
