Here is a long academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) as if written by acclaimed Los Angeles Times sports columnist Bill Plaschke:

Sustainable Development Goal 12 - The Sustainability Showdown

For too long, we've been playing a rigged game when it comes to consumption and production. The scoreboard is lopsided, the rule book is torn to shreds, and the referees are nowhere to be found. We're fouling our planet into oblivion through mindless, unchecked materialism. But there's a new contender in town - Sustainable Development Goal 12 - and it's about to blow the whistle on this globalized gluttony. 

Think of SDG 12 as the wily veteran coach, finally getting a chance to overhaul this dysfunctional franchise. Enough with the short-sighted greed that has us exploiting finite resources as if they'll last forever. This coach knows the future is sustainable, a circular economic model where waste is designed out and resources are judiciously reused. It's regenerative, not extractive - the antithesis of our current take-make-dispose insanity.

The stats on our woeful resource management would make any self-respecting sports fan blush. A third of food produced globally is lost or wasted, while almost a billion people go hungry. The fashion industry pumps out over 100 billion garments annually, even as clothing gets discarded faster than ever. Countries like the U.S. generate a staggering 250 million tons of municipal solid waste per year, with recycling rates barely cracking 35%. It's an embarrassing performance on the sustainability court.       

But SDG 12's game plan aims to rally a massive culture shift - to get all of us teammates consuming and producing far more responsibly by 2030. It's pushing hard for a transition to circular business models that close resource loops. Imagine top brands making durable, repairable products designed for disassembly and refurbishment. Image sharing platforms that cut waste by enabling borrowing instead of buying. All powered by radically rethought supply chains centered on resource productivity.

Key to SDG 12's strategy is the 3R offensive - reduce, reuse, recycle. Which means empowering companies, governments and consumers to do way more with way less. It means pricing externalities properly so buried environmental costs get priced into our decisions. It means boosting recycling rates globally through better infrastructure and awareness. And critically, it means slashing the staggering amount of food wasted by improving supply chains and changing household behaviors.

As with any good turnaround, there will be battles and setbacks. Lobbyists for the wasteful status quo will resist. Inertia and cultural conditioning will persist. Developing nations may see sustainable production as an unaffordable luxury. But SDG 12 has to seize the narrative because the alternative is an accelerating resource crunch that fouls out not just our economy but our entire way of life.  

Already we're seeing leaders emerge, clutch performers stepping up. The Netherlands cut food waste streams 40% through concerted efforts. Vancouver is piloting reusable container schemes for takeout. Countries like Rwanda implemented some of the world's toughest restrictions on plastic bags. And pioneering companies from Patagonia to Burger King are prioritizing circularity, transparency and plant-based models. 

Still, winning this championship for sustainable consumption and production will require all of us lacing up and committing for the full 48 minutes. Companies have to radically rethink business models. Governments must align policies and incentives. And every fan needs to reject the throwaway culture that's trashing our home court.

It's more than just doing the right thing. It's realizing we have no other option if we want to keep playing this game called life on planet Earth. The buzzer is sounding, the clock is winding down, and we're trailing big-time. But Sustainable Development Goal 12 represents our last, best opportunity to pull off an improbable comeback for the ages. Forget the sugarcoated greenwashing - this is about rejecting the wasteful insanity that's jeopardizing our future. It's time to get sustainable, or get eliminated.
