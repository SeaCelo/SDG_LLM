Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) as if written by Andrew Bolt, with a skeptical and critical perspective:

The Sham of "Sustainable" Consumption and Production

The United Nations has gifted us with another meaningless, anti-prosperity target in the form of Sustainable Development Goal 12 - "Responsible Consumption and Production." This supposedly noble aim to "ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns" is really just a Trojan horse for a radical green agenda hellbent on demonizing free markets and consumerism.

The central premise behind this SDG is the unsubstantiated claim that our consumption habits are fundamentally "unsustainable" and damaging to the environment. But this neo-Malthusian ideology conveniently ignores the incredible innovations and efficiencies ushered in by capitalism. As we've become more prosperous, the amount of resources and energy needed per unit of GDP has plummeted. The disposable income generated by free markets has allowed us to devote more resources to environmental protection than ever before. Sanitation, clean water access, and air quality have all improved drastically in free market economies. 

The rabid anti-consumerism of the SDG 12 advocates also fails to recognize that consumer demand and profit motives drive companies to increase sustainability in order to reduce costly inputs and waste. We don't need heavy-handed government diktats or oppressive regulations to create a "circular economy." Cost-saving recycling, reuse, and repurposing make complete business sense. It's why companies like Apple, H&M, Adidas and many others have already embraced recycling and sustainable sourcing voluntarily where feasible.   

The SDG 12 targets for "sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources" and "environmentally sound management of chemicals" sound positive on their face. But they set the stage for restrictive red tape and top-down interventions that will stifle economic growth and innovation under the guise of sustaining arbitrary resource usage quotas. It legitimizes regulatory overreach into free markets and private business operations based on discriminatory definitions of what practices are deemed "sustainable" or not by bureaucrats and ideologues.

The SDG also promotes the ridiculous, anti-science notion of "sustainable tourism." The immense economic and cultural value generated by tourism far outweighs its relatively small environmental footprint. Are we really going to block prosperous countries like Australia from benefiting from a thriving tourism sector based on evidence-free sustainability fearmongering? Talk about letting the latte-sipping elites deprive developing economies of badly needed growth and opportunity.

At its core, SDG 12 represents an arrogant attempt to impose draconian behavioral controls over free people under the guise of environmentalism. The self-anointed central planners believe they can re-engineer the attitudes and consumption patterns of 7 billion people through shame, taxation, and punitive regulation. Their micro-managing designs on everything from food waste to energy usage to "sustainable lifestyles" reveal a fervor for eco-totalitarianism. Making hedonistic choices over how we live, what we eat, and what we buy apparently has to be subjected to scrutiny by the UN Green Police.

These SDG targets are really just a stalking horse for neo-socialist wealth redistribution schemes like carbon taxes disguised as sustainability policy. The data shows aggregate global resource consumption has been relatively stable in recent decades. The real problem is that a third of the world remains impoverished and energy deprived. Rather than celebrating incredible triumphs in resource-use efficiency, the UN has set arbitrary "sustainable" limits that threaten to deny the poor a route to prosperity.

In reality, there is no conflict between economic growth and environmental progress. Rising wealth, technological innovation and free market incentives are key drivers of environmental quality. SDG 12 completely ignores these synergies in favor of regressive, supply-constraining sustainability nostrums that would trap billions in poverty. We should reject heavy-handed attempts to centrally plan our way to "sustainable" consumption and production in favor of free market prosperity that organically incentivizes efficient resource use through profit motives and consumer choice.
