Waste Not, Want Not: The $4.5 Trillion Opportunity in Responsible Consumption and Production

By the Fortune Editorial Board

In a world of finite resources, the linear "take, make, waste" model of production and consumption is fundamentally unsustainable. Every year, an estimated one-third of all food produced globally is lost or wasted, while the fashion industry discards millions of tons of textile waste. At the same time, haphazard management of chemicals and toxic materials threatens environmental degradation and human health worldwide.

Clearly, change is urgently needed - which is where Sustainable Development Goal 12 comes in. SDG 12, adopted by the United Nations in 2015, calls for "sustainable consumption and production patterns" across all sectors of the global economy by 2030. Its sweeping targets aim to halve global per capita food waste, achieve sustainable management of chemicals and wastes, reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse, and promote sustainable practices across supply chains.

While the challenges are daunting, achieving SDG 12 represents a colossal economic opportunity for businesses estimated at a staggering $4.5 trillion annually by 2030. Companies that proactively rethink consumption from a circular economy model stand to benefit tremendously from new revenue streams, reduced costs, and increased competitive advantage in the years ahead.

Consider innovative textile recycler Renewcell, which has pioneered a patented process to dissolve cotton and other natural fibers into a reusable raw material. Backed by investors like H&M and Renewcell plans to open a game-changing recycling facility in 2025 - helping the fashion industry slash its massive waste footprint while seizing a share of a potentially $100 billion circular economy.

Or Apeel Sciences, which has developed a plant-derived food coating that nearly doubles the shelf life of fruits and vegetables. With staggering annual losses of $1 trillion due to food waste, Apeel has drawn over $110 million in venture funding for its innovative solution to SDG Target 12.3.

In the chemicals industry, major players like BASF are racing to reformulate products with sustainable ingredients while improving transparency of hazardous materials handling across their operations and supply chains. Meanwhile, tech giants like Microsoft are investing heavily in "product cloud" capabilities to provide digital product lifecycle tracking from design to disposal or reuse.

While progress has been steady, we're still far from achieving SDG 12 targets. Food waste remains endemic, with consumers in rich countries wasting almost as much food as the entire net production of sub-Saharan Africa each year. Only 20% of e-waste is formally recycled, with the remaining 40 million tons often incinerated or landfilled. And hazardous chemicals continue leaking into soil and water with abandon in many parts of the world.

To catalyze change at scale, governments must establish smart regulations and incentives that reward circular business models while penalizing unsustainable waste generation. They should partner with the private sector to invest in recycling infrastructure, R&D for sustainable materials, and training for green jobs. Just as importantly, consumers must vote with their dollars by embracing products designed for reuse, repair and recycling.

Those organizations that move boldly now to embed sustainability and circularity into their operations - rethinking their entire business models in the process - stand to reap the biggest long-term rewards. In a world of dwindling resources, there's simply too much value to waste.
