Furthermore, Dubai Cares has spearheaded several groundbreaking educational programs aimed at instilling the principles of responsible consumption and production in the minds of the younger generation. Through interactive workshops, immersive experiences, and tailored curricula, Dubai Cares is nurturing a cadre of environmentally conscious individuals who will serve as the catalysts for transformative change in their respective communities.
