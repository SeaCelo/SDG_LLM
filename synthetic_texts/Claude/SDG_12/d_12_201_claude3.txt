Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) as if written by conservative columnist Cal Thomas:

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals have been hailed by many as a roadmap for creating a better world by 2030. However, one of the goals in particular – SDG 12 on responsible consumption and production – reveals the utopian and anti-capitalist underpinnings of this entire UN agenda. 

At its core, SDG 12 is a thinly veiled attack on free market economies and the consumer culture they have cultivated over decades of peace, prosperity and innovation. The goal calls for "sustainable consumption and production patterns" which is code language for restricting consumer choice, hampering economic growth, and expanding the reach of global governance.

The specific targets within SDG 12 lay bare the anti-business mindset behind it. Target 12.6 calls on governments to "encourage companies...to adopt sustainable practices and to integrate sustainability information into their reporting cycle." In other words, unelected UN bureaucrats want to saddle private enterprises with onerous sustainability reporting requirements that will swell corporate compliance costs and distract from their core missions of product innovation, job creation and shareholder return maximization.

Even more pernicious is Target 12.8 which calls for ensuring "people everywhere have the relevant information and awareness for sustainable development and lifestyles in harmony with nature." Let's decode that opaque language: global activists want to bombard citizens with propaganda promoting anti-consumerist, hair shirt-wearing "sustainable lifestyles" that are appropriate for eco-villages, not modern civilizations built on capitalist abundance.

Lurking beneath the optimistic veneer of SDG 12 is an unmistakable hostility toward material prosperity and profit-driven enterprise. It represents a thinly disguised attempt to institute global controls over economic behavior from a top-down, command-and-control perspective completely at odds with market economics.

The UN's infatuation with "sustainable development" as a whole reflects the scientism and nature worship that has gripped many elite institutions in recent decades. Sustainable development theory romanticizes returning humanity to a mystical "sustainable" existence that channels our inner tree-huggers and suppresses our entrepreneurial, accumulative instincts. It imagines a world where everyone is frozen in stasis, consuming only what nature can eternally replenish and producing no goods or services beyond basic subsistence.

In reality, of course, the essence of human progress throughout history has been our ceaseless quest to transcend natural limits through innovation, exploration, and ever-higher levels of productivity. Market capitalism harnesses human ingenuity toward these ends by incentivizing resourcefulness, efficiency, and the constant pursuit of new and better ways to create value for consumers.

SDG 12's vision of government-dictated "sustainable consumption and production" patterns is the very antithesis of this dynamic, progress-nurturing system. It seeks to replace the invisible hand of the market with the iron fist of bureaucratic diktats. Instead of unleashing human potential through economic freedom, it would straitjacket our prosperity-generating impulses in the name of averting a planet-spanning eco-apocalypse conjured by computer models and doomsaying activists.

As with other statist aspects of the UN's 2030 agenda, SDG 12 represents an arrogant attempt by philosophical naturalists to override laws of economics and human nature through brute governmental force. Just as no amount of environmental regulation can repeal supply and demand, no amount of hectoring about "sustainable lifestyles" can stamp out the innate human drive to achieve, create, accumulate, and cultivate comfort and status through material acquisition.

The road to true sustainability lies not in eco-monastic austerity imposed from above, but in embracing the liberating power of market capitalism to make human civilization an engine of abundance and regeneration through constant economic evolution. Responsible production means harnessing the profit incentive to develop ever-more eco-friendly processes and technologies that deliver better goods using less energy and fewer raw materials. Responsible consumption means unleashing human choice, ingenuity and acquisitiveness to discover smarter ways to reduce, reuse and recycle while maintaining high living standards.

By empowering free people rather than bureaucratic planners, market economies have an unparalleled track record of decoupling rising prosperity from resource depletion through game-changing efficiency and sustainability innovations. Mandating simplistic austerity and anti-growth controls, as SDG 12 implicitly calls for, would stifle this fount of human creativity and bring a halt to the march of eco-friendly progress.

Just as no bureaucracy could have conceived and implemented the wave of world-changing innovations that flowed from the microchip revolution, doubling down on centralized economic control will put the brakes on the process of compounding ingenuity needed to create a truly sustainable global civilization. SDG 12 reflects a profound lack of faith in the ability of free people to solve global problems through spontaneous cooperation, dynamism and enterprise. For that reason alone, it deserves to be consigned to the ash heap of utopian statist schemes.
