Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 12 – Responsible Consumption and Production, written from the perspective of Ben Jann, a renowned expert on sustainable development:

The unsustainable patterns of production and consumption that characterize modern human civilization pose a dire existential threat. Anthropogenic drivers like population growth, urbanization, rising affluence, and technological disruption have sent consumption rates skyrocketing, exerting relentless pressure on the earth's finite natural resources. This trajectory of overconsumption is ecologically destabilizing, fueling biodiversity loss, ecosystem destruction, and climate change. It is economically unsound, binding nations to volatile commodity markets and the vagaries of globalized supply chains. And it is socially unjust, with the externalized costs of hyper-consumption unduly burdening marginalized populations worldwide. 

Recognizing this multidimensional crisis, the United Nations established SDG 12 to "ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns." Achieving this imperative demands a fundamental restructuring of the predominant linear economic model of extraction, production, consumption, and disposal. Instead, we must transition towards circular economic systems designed for resource efficiency, waste prevention, and closed material loops.

On the production side, this entails comprehensive life cycle assessments to identify hotspots for intervention across product and service value chains. Upstream improvements span sustainable sourcing of raw materials, industrial symbiosis and eco-industrial park development, energy and material use optimization, and green chemistry principles. Rigorous eco-design philosophies focused on durability, reparability, upgradability, modularity, and Design for the Circular Economy can enhance resource productivity and retain material value.  

For consumption, the focus shifts to catalyzing demand for sustainable products and services through green public procurement, eco-labeling, sustainability standards and certifications, and curbing unsustainable consumption fueled by consumerism. Minimizing food waste from farm to fork and tackling the pervasive issue of plastic waste by phasing out single-use plastics are key priorities. Extending product lifetimes through reuse, repair, remanufacturing, and refurbishment business models can "slow" consumption cycles.

Critically, sustainable consumption and production (SCP) must be decoupled from economic growth to align with ecological carrying capacities. This decoupling necessitates alternative prosperity models transcending GDP as the primary metric of development. Holistic indicators accounting for natural, human, and social capital depletion are vital for measuring genuine progress. Policy frameworks premised on green growth, steady-state economics, degrowth, doughnut economics, and other regenerative paradigms offer complementary visions.

Achieving SCP requires concerted multi-stakeholder action. Governments must robustly incentivize sustainability through fiscal policies, regulations, innovation funding, and public investment while phasing out perverse subsidies. The private sector bears responsibility for upholding corporate sustainability, extended producer responsibility, and embracing circularity as a source of competitive advantage. Civil society plays an indispensable role in driving sustainable lifestyles, exerting consumer advocacy, building grassroots momentum, and holding institutions accountable.  

Ultimately, SDG 12 challenges the cultural anthropocentrism at the root of our unsustainable trajectory. A civilizational shift towards an ecological worldview – one that recognizes humanity's interrelationship with the biosphere – is imperative for survival and flourishing on this finite planet we all share. Sustainable consumption and production embodies the ethos of living well within ecological boundaries. It is nothing less than the path to a prosperous future for all.
