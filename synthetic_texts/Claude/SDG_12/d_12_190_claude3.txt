Here is a comprehensive academic article discussing Sustainable Development Goal 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production - as if written by conservative commentator Ben Shapiro:

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 12 calls for sustainable consumption and production patterns. On its face, this seems like an innocuous, perhaps even positive aim. Who could be against sustainability and efficiency? 

However, we must carefully examine the premises and implications underlying this particular SDG. At its core, the goal of "sustainable consumption and production" is rooted in the idea that human activity and economic growth are inherently unsustainable drains on finite natural resources. This is the anti-human vision of neo-malthusians and environmental doomsdayers who view people as locust-like consumers. Their solution? Drastically curb human economic development under the guise of "sustainable" production and consumption.

This is blatantly anti-capitalist and anti-human. Throughout history, free markets and human innovation have consistently defied malthusian predictions of resource scarcity. As populations have grown and economies have expanded, standards of living have risen and resources have become more abundant and efficiently utilized - not less. The doomsayers have constantly moved the goalposts, repeatedly proven wrong by the evidence. Fossil fuels were supposed to run out in the 1970s. Instead, new extraction technologies have made energy more plentiful than ever. The dire predictions of overpopulation and mass starvation from 50 years ago never came to pass, as agricultural yields per acre have skyrocketed.  

Time and again, human ingenuity and free market incentives for efficiency have overcome perceived limits to growth. More people means more minds working to develop new technologies, products, and solutions that raise living standards. The true drivers of resource depletion are not capitalist systems of free exchange, but command-and-control economies without property rights that are fundamentally divorced from market pricing and the laws of supply and demand.

The agenda behind SDG 12 is a stalking horse for global governance in the name of "sustainability." It is about ushering in a new international bureaucracy to regulate and restrict consumption and production by ordinary people and businesses. This is sold under the high-minded banners of "reducing food waste" and "changing unsustainable patterns." But the core goal is centralizing control over economic decision-making in the hands of unelected, unaccountable global institutions.

This is unacceptable. Sustainable development must mean finding innovative ways to grow living standards for all, not instituting draconian constraints on growth and enterprise in the name of sustainability dogma. The private sector, free markets, and protection of property rights are the true drivers of environmental efficiency and abundance - not global supervision of consumption habits by bureaucratic diktat.

Human beings have an unlimited capacity for creativity and progress when permitted to operate freely. Global institutions like the UN should embrace this reality rather than reverting to antiquated, disproven malthusian myths about resource scarcity and limits to growth. We must firmly reject SDG 12's fundamentally anti-human agenda cloaked in the language of sustainability. True sustainability means celebrating and unleashing humanity's boundless potential through economic freedom.
