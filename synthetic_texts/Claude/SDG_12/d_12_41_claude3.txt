Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), written from the perspective of conservative Australian political commentator Piers Akerman:

The Folly of Sustainable Development Goal 12: A Threat to Capitalism and Economic Freedom

By Piers Akerman

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 12 calls for "responsible consumption and production patterns." On the surface, this may sound innocuous enough - who could be against responsible behavior? However, a closer examination reveals this goal to be a thinly veiled assault on free market capitalism and a Trojan horse for heavy-handed government intervention.    

At its core, SDG 12 peddles the insidious notion that our current modes of production and consumption are inherently unsustainable and damaging to the environment. This neo-Malthusian ideology posits that we are living beyond the planet's means and must fundamentally restructure our economic systems lest we deplete the world's resources. Cloaked in ponderous academic verbiage about "lifecycle management" and "eco-efficiency," the true agenda is to shackle businesses with stringent regulations, carbon pricing schemes, and bureaucratic oversight.  

The central planning diktats envisaged by SDG 12 would be a nightmare of red tape and rent-seeking from special interests masquerading as corporate "stakeholders." Everyday consumer products and services we take for granted could become exorbitantly expensive or disappear entirely due to arbitrary sustainability criteria imposed by unelected bureaucrats. The economic costs of transitioning to a "circular economy" with mandated reuse, recycling, and waste reduction metrics would be ruinous and deliver a massive self-inflicted wound to productivity and living standards.

Furthermore, SDG 12 smuggles in the corrosive notion of sustainability education for "sustainable lifestyles." In other words, impressionable young minds are to be propagandized into feeling civic guilt about their personal consumption habits and ecomodernist capitalist values. This cynical attempt at values shaping has more in common with authoritarian regimes of the past than the liberal democracies that made the modern prosperous world possible.  

The inconvenient truth is that unfettered free markets, technological innovation, and economic growth have consistently proven the most effective drivers of environmental progress and resource efficiency. Nations mired in poverty and centralized control are invariably far more destructive and negligent custodians of the natural world. As societies grow wealthier, they can afford to care more for the environment out of discretionary income rather than desperation.

Just look at the precipitous declines in air and water pollution across developed nations over recent decades - a virtuous by-product of affluence and technological advancement, not draconian regulatory fiats of the SDG 12 variety. Economically vibrant nations with strong property rights and rule of law are consistently better environmental stewards than statist regimes that SDG cheerleaders bizarrely seem to champion.  

At the end of the day, the Sustainable Development Goals represent an aggressive ideological campaign to fundamentally reorder the economic foundations of the modern world. SDG 12 in particular poses an existential risk to economic freedom and consumer sovereignty under the guise of environmental uplift. Nations should decisively reject this backdoor attempt to subjugate market rationality to bureaucratic pipedreams - our prosperity and way of life depends on it.
