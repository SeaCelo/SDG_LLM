Here is a draft long academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), written from the perspective of conservative political commentator Mark Steyn:

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals are a prime example of the kind of utopian central planning that should set off alarm bells for any sane observer of human affairs. SDG 12 calls for nations to "ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns" by 2030. On the surface, who could object to that? We all want to lighten our footprint on the planet. But dig a little deeper and you'll find the same sort of naive, arrogant ambition to reshape human behavior that characterizes the worst excesses of the climate bamboozlers and eco-puritans.

The bureaucrats behind this SDG seem to think they can reshape the consumption and production habits of 8 billion people worldwide within a few short years. This type of dreamy utopianism puts me in mind of communist five-year plans or the crazed predictions of Paul Ehrlich and the population bombers back in the 1970s. Newsflash for the continental crayonners at the UN: The world doesn't work that way. Human beings are wildly diverse and no amount of social engineering will change their desire for comfortable living standards overnight.  

Take developing nations where hundreds of millions still lack reliable electricity, let alone the latest smart refrigerator. Are we honestly meant to believe these people can be weaned off the lure of modernity and access to the living standards we in the West take for granted? The UN bureaucrats want Africans and Asians to consume less while their own affluent societies continue getting plumper by the year. There's a word for that sort of arrogant hypocrisy.

And what of the supposedly overconsumptive Western nations? These sustainable development commissars think they can nudge us towards eating locally-grown turnips and cycling everywhere within less than a decade. Here's a reality check: Many citizens in advanced economies live comfortably yet frugal lifestyles already. What goods do they actually overconsume that need urgent curtailing by 2030? The projections for reducing waste in wealthy nations seem utterly disconnected from the mundane realities of life. We're nowhere near the dystopian future dreamed up by these eco-maniacs.

The wonks at the UN are so focused on abstractions and statistical modeling that they fail to account for the improvisational messiness and diversity of the real world. Each individual, business, and nation will find their own particular mix of sustainable and unsustainable activities. Some may adopt new tech that radically cuts their footprint, others will make smaller lifestyle changes, still others will ignore all the eco-preening and plough their own furrow. This organic, decentralized process driven by individual choices is how real progress happens - not through dreamy SDG targets imposed by a centralized bureaucracy.

Let's also not forget that "sustainable production" is often code for undermining capitalism and free markets - the very economic engine that has lifted billions from poverty and enabled the material surpluses that allow us to care about environmental issues in the first place. Do these UNninnies really think that poverty-stricken, corrupt regimes will lead the way to greener production patterns?

In reality, the profit motive and technological innovation by private firms are already driving massive efficiency gains and investment in sustainable production. That's capitalism's genius - entrepreneurs finding new ways to do more with less. Meanwhile, uncompetitive soviet-style bureaucracies just continue spewing the same old statist emission: A surfeit of paper plans utterly divorced from reality.

The free world has outgrown these utopian social engineers and their numerical reveries. This latest round of "sustainable development goals" will be about as successful as all the previous fool's errand targets - paying plenty of lip service while the real world charts its own spontaneous path forward through individual choices, not diktats from on high. In the end, the UN's technocratic doomsayers and centralized cure will once again be outpaced and marginalized by the decentralized, pragmatic ingenuity of the market.
