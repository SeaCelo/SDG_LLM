Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production, written from the perspective of the late British writer A.A. Gill:

The Unbearable Profligacy of Existing

"We should all start to take it a little more slowly," my friend George Mikes once said to me over an excruciatingly languid seven-hour lunch at his club. He was holding court, warming to his theme about the perils of modern life accelerating beyond the pace of human equilibrium. "People don't understand the price of haste," he pontificated with characteristic understatement.

Mikes was ahead of the curve, as the colonials are wont to say, in his recognition of humanity's blind rush towards existential obsolescence through mindless consumption and careless waste. We are digging the mass grave of our species with every plastic straw cavalierly flicked into the concreted arteries of our choked metropolises. Just as the high-minded philosophers of the Enlightenment first pierced the veil of theocratic orthodoxy with their radical ideas of reason and empiricism, so must we boldly raze the stifling dogma of disposable consumerism.

The 12th Sustainable Development Goal established by the United Nations in 2015 - the rather drearily named "Responsible Consumption and Production" - is a judicious first step in slowing the careening train of capitalist excess before it utterly defaces the paradise of this unbasked Earth. Within its eight succinct targets lies an elegant theoretical framework for the reversal of humanity's compulsive gorging at the trough of our finite resources. Yet in practice, the goal represents little more than a band-aid vainly stemming the gushing brachial artery of our rapacious consumption.

Consider the almost fetishistic role that food waste plays in the decadent divertissements of the modern elite gastronome. The very best restaurants are judged not merely on the quality of their ingredients and the artfulness of their composition, but on the sheerjouissance of skewing whole roasted feathered fowl with glistening mahogany skin and rochers of jewel-like sauce evidence. How much better it would be to eschew this vulgarian pageantry in favor of more humble prix-fixe servings tailored to individual diners' modest appetitive requirements, the ingredients locally-sourced and environmentally low-impact. But such self-imposed austerity would hardly sate the epicurean sensibilities that define the discriminating wealthy.

No, it is an inescapable truth that the richest among us remain the most flagrant transgressors when it comes to needless consumption and the attendant generational ecocide. The 12th Goal explicitly calls for a reformation in "the processes and supply chains" to account for "environmental costs," yet there persists a deafening silence on the mechanisms for incentivizing - much less compelling - the global oligarchy to forsake its deeply-entrenched habits of wasteful self-indulgence. Perhaps some fiscal disincentive levied steeply upon those profligate lifestyles so antithetical to sustainability? Alas, that seems a rather vulgar free-market solution unbefitting the lofty ideals of these hallowed development goals.

Yet is there not a more existential solution to be found in the stark contrast between the opulence of the few and the desperate poverties of the many? Would not the great equalizing consciousness shift of realizing our common environmental legacy prove more efficacious than any hectoring summons to austerity? When we recognize that we all partake in consuming the same finite vitalities of this lone planetary vessel carrying us through the cosmic vacuum, perhaps then we may collectively awaken to the wisdom of the 12th Goal's judicious counsel. For what better inspiration to sustainable existence than the bone-deep understanding that we are all nomads traversing the same fragile celestial oasis?

My friend Mikes may have passed into the ether, but his spirit of languid equanimity endures as a sly wink in the face of human overstimulation. We would all do well to savor the essence of the 12th Goal and learn to take things a little more...slowly. Our very existence may depend upon it.
