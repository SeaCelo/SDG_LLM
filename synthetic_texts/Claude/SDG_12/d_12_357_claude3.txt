As the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, we are deeply invested in promoting sustainable consumption and production patterns, aligning with the targets outlined in Sustainable Development Goal 12 (SDG 12). Our commitment to this goal stems from the recognition that rapid industrialization and population growth have exacerbated resource depletion, environmental degradation, and greenhouse gas emissions, posing significant challenges to sustainable development in Asia and beyond.

Central to our efforts is the promotion of resource efficiency and circular economy principles. We recognize that linear models of production and consumption, where resources are extracted, transformed into products, and ultimately discarded as waste, are inherently unsustainable. Therefore, we actively support initiatives that decouple economic growth from resource consumption and environmental degradation.

One of our flagship projects in this domain is the Circular Economy Financing Facility, a dedicated fund that provides concessional financing and technical assistance to private sector entities transitioning towards circular business models. This facility has catalyzed investments in innovative technologies for resource recovery, waste valorization, and industrial symbiosis, where the by-products of one industry become the inputs for another.

For instance, our funding has enabled the establishment of a cutting-edge waste-to-energy facility in a rapidly industrializing city in Southeast Asia. This facility not only diverts significant volumes of municipal solid waste from landfills but also converts it into clean energy, contributing to both sustainable waste management and renewable energy generation. Furthermore, the facility incorporates advanced sorting and recycling technologies, exemplifying the principles of a circular economy.

Furthermore, we have recognized the pivotal role of sustainable public procurement in driving market demand for environmentally preferable goods and services. Through our technical assistance programs, we have supported several member countries in developing and implementing green public procurement policies and guidelines. These efforts have facilitated the integration of environmental criteria into government procurement processes, incentivizing the private sector to adopt cleaner production methods and eco-friendly product designs.

Complementing our investment and policy initiatives, we have forged strategic partnerships with international organizations, research institutions, and civil society organizations to promote sustainable consumption and production patterns. These collaborations have enabled us to leverage cutting-edge research, disseminate best practices, and foster multi-stakeholder dialogues on critical issues such as sustainable lifestyles, responsible advertising, and consumer education.

One notable example is our partnership with a prestigious university in East Asia, where we have co-funded a research program on behavioral economics and nudging techniques to encourage sustainable consumption behaviors. This initiative has yielded valuable insights into the design of effective interventions, such as eco-labeling schemes, incentive structures, and awareness campaigns, which we have subsequently integrated into our policy advisory services.

Furthermore, we recognize the importance of addressing the informal sector, which often operates outside the formal regulatory frameworks and contributes significantly to resource inefficiency and environmental degradation. In partnership with local governments and community organizations, we have implemented capacity-building programs that provide training, access to financing, and market linkages for informal waste pickers and recyclers. These initiatives not only promote sustainable livelihoods but also contribute to resource recovery and environmental protection.

Looking ahead, we remain steadfast in our commitment to SDG 12 and the broader 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We recognize that achieving sustainable consumption and production patterns requires a systemic transformation of our economies and societies. As such, we will continue to leverage our unique position as a multilateral development bank to mobilize financing, catalyze policy reforms, foster innovation, and facilitate cross-border cooperation in pursuit of a more sustainable and resilient future for Asia and the world.
