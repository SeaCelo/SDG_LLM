Here is a draft long academic article about SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) as if written by Maureen Dowd:

With Capitalism Devouring the Planet, It's Time to Get Respons-able

By Maureen Dowd

We're living in a world that has fallen down a rabbit hole of rabid consumerism, and we've been gorging ourselves on a smorgasbord of excess. From fast fashion flooding landfills to the Pacific Garbage Patch choking our oceans, the level of waste is utterly insane. It's starting to give me an existential hangover.

Let's be real - the capitalists won this round. They turned us all into mad consumers, addicted to accumulating more stuff to fill the gaping void in our souls with material gratification. We're like suburban zombies, stumbling through big box stores, grabbing anything touted as a "hot item" on influencer Instagram feeds. 

Meanwhile, the planet is crying out like a hormonal teenage daughter, "You're ruining my life!" And she's not being melodramatic - we're recklessly sucking down limited natural resources, polluting fragile ecosystems, and generating obscene amounts of trash in the process. Thanks to our demented binge, we're barreling towards a real-life apocalyptic horror show way worse than The Road.

The United Nations obviously figured we've hit peak crazy with our wasteful ways and made "Responsible Consumption and Production" one of their 17 Sustainable Development Goals. It's like a big cosmic wake-up call, pleading with us to stop wolfing down the entire fridge after a bad breakup.

So what's the solution? We need to resist the siren's call of mindless consumerism and heed the wisdom of thrift. Look to your grandparents who survived the Great Depression - those women could stretch a ratty old muslin curtain into reusable everything from dustrags to diapers. Reuse, repurpose, rethink - that should be our new mantra.

Countries need to make businesses rein in their wasteful tendencies by taxing polluters and irresponsible practices. Companies should be forced to find more sustainable ways to create products and reduce unnecessary packaging. And individuals need to curb the acquisitive itch by reducing, reusing, recycling and repairing as much as possible.

It will take a seismic mindset shift to get respons-able again. We've bought into the toxic notion that our self-worth is measured by our net worth and that acquiring truckloads of superfluous stuff will somehow fill the existential emptiness inside us. Time to face the truth - we're drowning ourselves in garbage while asphyxiating the Earth.

Unless we as a species want to choke on all the discarded plastic, we need to embrace minimalism, simplify our lives, and escape the materialistic matrix. Stop envying the Kardashians and their ridiculous mountains of fast fashion.  Emulate Socrates instead, the dude who was content just questioning the heck out of everything while wearing a raggedy robe.

If we don't start venerating thriftiness as the new cool virtue, Mother Nature will find a way to enforce sustainability by ushering in mad scarcity. Overconsumption is quickly becoming an indulgence we can't afford. So let's get respons-able before it's too late and this consumer binge ends with us passed out, covered in crumbs and regurgitated plastic.
