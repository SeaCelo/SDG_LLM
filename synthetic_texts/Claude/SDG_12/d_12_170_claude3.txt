Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), written from the perspective of economist Paul Krugman:

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has laid out an ambitious set of goals aimed at creating a more just, equitable and environmentally sustainable world. Among these, Sustainable Development Goal 12 – achieving responsible consumption and production patterns – represents one of the most vital yet intrinsically challenging objectives we face. Its importance cannot be overstated, as the prevailing "take-make-dispose" economic model is fundamentally unsustainable and incompatible with the finite resources of our planet. 

Transitioning to a circular economy that decouples economic growth from resource extraction and environmental degradation is imperative. However, this will require a profound reconceptualization of our production systems, supply chains, and consumer behavior – no easy feat given the entrenched incentives and path dependencies inherent in modern capitalism.

From the supply side, we must address the issue of externalities head-on. The prices of consumer and industrial goods rarely reflect their true environmental and social costs over the product lifecycle. Inefficient taxation, subsidies, and regulatory regimes have led to rampant market failures when it comes to realizing the full cost of un-sustainable practices. We have perversely incentivized waste, pollution, planned obsolescence, and the over-exploitation of natural capital.

Smart policies like carbon pricing, extended producer responsibility schemes, eco-labelling requirements, and a systematic shift away from fossil fuel subsidies could go a long way in re-aligning market forces. But such interventions will inevitably face fierce opposition from entrenched industry interests – a political economy challenge we cannot ignore. Equitably distributing the transition costs across society while maintaining a stable investment climate will be crucial.

On the demand side, we also have our work cut out. Decades of effective marketing have conditioned consumers – especially in the global North – to develop virtually insatiable appetites for material consumption as a means of experiencing happiness, social status and self-actualization. Widespread commercialization, planned obsolescence, and a cultural association between resource use and the "good life" have created considerable barriers to embracing the mindset shifts necessary for sustainable consumption.

We cannot rely on individual behavior changes alone. Smart choice architecture, gamification strategies, sustainability education at all levels, and perhaps even regulated reductions in permitted consumption levels may be required as part of a multipronged approach. Admittedly, this ventures into philosophically murky waters regarding the boundaries of personal liberty and the role of the state in shaping societal values.

Yet the imperative of respecting environmental limits means we may ultimately have no choice but to revisit some long-held precepts of consumer sovereignty and economic organization. What good is safeguarding individuals' right to consume limitlessly if it ultimately leads to the despoliation of the natural capital on which long-term prosperity depends?

As we confront these challenges, an East-West dialogue and exchange of perspectives takes on heightened importance. Many ancient philosophies and worldviews from Asia emphasize the virtues of moderation, minimalism, and respect for nature as sources of human flourishing – ideas that may provide a needed counterweight to Western overconsumption. At the same time, developing economies in the global South understandably aspire to attain living standards comparable to the rich world. A globally coordinated sustainability roadmap respectful of these realities will be needed.

Furthermore, the rising economic clout of major emerging markets provides perhaps our best chance to redesign production processes, supply chain logistics, and recycling infrastructure from the ground up to align with circularity principles. Sustainable industrialization need not slavishly follow the environmentally destructive path trodden by early industrializers.

Underpinning all of this is the need for a new unifying economic paradigm that can supersede the blinkered, growth-obsessed metrics that currently dominate policymaking. We require analytical frameworks that rigorously incorporate natural and social capital factors and can quantify the true welfare implications – both present and future – of resource depletion and ecological degradation. In short, a Great Remake of economics itself.

The complexity and scale of the SDG 12 challenge is daunting. Centuries of production and consumption dogmas must be reassessed. Deeply entrenched political economy dynamics will need to be navigated. Fundamental philosophical tensions regarding the boundaries of human wants must be confronted. Yet the stakes could not be higher. We stand at a critical juncture where muddling through is no longer tenable. Achieving sustainable consumption and production is not only vital for environmental reasons, but will determine whether advanced, emerging and developing economies alike can maintain social and political stability in the coming decades. The transition will be arduous, but represents the ultimate economic policy challenge of the 21st century.
