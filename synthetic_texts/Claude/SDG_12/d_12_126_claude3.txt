Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), written from the perspective of Simon Jenkins as an expert on the SDGs:

Our relentless consumption of the world's finite resources is pushing the planet to the brink. We produce and squander at a pace that shows blatant disregard for the long-term viability of life on Earth. The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 12 - to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns - tackles this crisis head on. It calls for a radical rethinking of how we make, use, and dispose of materials and products. 

The numbers are grim. The global population now consumes 1.6 planets' worth of resources each year, a figure that rises to 3 planets in high-income Western nations. At the current rate of exploitation, we will require the resources of three Earths by 2050. Our hunger for energy, minerals, land, water and timber is stripping the planet bare. This overconsumption is the dark underbelly of affluence and economic "progress."

SDG 12 demands a decoupling of economic growth from resource use through improved efficiency. Products must be designed for longevity, repair, reuse, and recycling. Supply chains must embrace circularity to cut waste. Food loss and waste, accounting for one-third of global production, must be slashed. The goal sets specific targets on sustainable management of natural resources, reduction of food waste, sound management of chemicals and wastes, and adoption of sustainable practices by companies.

But it goes beyond greening production. More profound societal change is needed in the consumption sphere. We cannot keep feeding the insatiable appetite for more stuff and novelty with a return to business as usual. A cultural shift is required to curb our rampant materialism and embrace sufficiency. 

This mentality is antithetical to the incessant marketing that tries to convince us we need the latest product, design or technology. It fuels mall cultures and trashes mindful living. It preys on our behavioural biases, using sophisticated tactics to tap into our desires for status, novelty, convenience and indulgence. The result is that many live far beyond their means in feverish cycles of want and disposability. This is unsustainable materialism on a suicidal path.

SDG 12's vision forces a reckoning with our consumption values and patterns. The imperative is to avoid, reduce, reuse, repurpose, recycle - in that order of priority. Avoiding the cyclical churn of acquisition is the first aim before smarter product life cycles kick in. People's status satisfaction must evolve from a cultivated appetite for possessions to an appreciation of access-based services and experiences over ownership.

This is no luddite, anti-progress stance. Sustainable innovation can provide better ways to meet our fundamental needs. Smart, modular product designs can extend life cycles decades beyond today's purposefully ephemeral paradigm. New business models and digital platforms can enable efficient sharing, renting and reuse to cut overall resource demands. But we cannot simply efficiency our way out of this crisis through techno-fixes alone.   

At its core, SDG 12 challenges the dogma that more consumption equals more wellbeing and happiness. From urbanites drowning in clutter to villagers battling pollution, there is a dawning consciousness that our feverish material pursuits are not delivering authentic fulfillment. This awakening has spawned many locally-grounded movements that reject the relentless consumerist paradigm.

The deeper question is how we can redefine society's vision of prosperity beyond simply material growth and possessions. Can we thrive through more conscious consumption - not mindless buying, but discriminating purchase choices aligned with our core values and needs? Can businesses be profitable by providing durable value rather than disposable products? Can governments catalyze more sustainable lifestyles through astute policy levers rather than fixating on GDP? These are the fundamental challenges surfaced by SDG 12.

Our abuse of the planet's resources is the existential risk of our age. We stand at a crossroads - to urgently overhaul our wildly unsustainable production and consumption systems, or to hurtle towards catastrophe. That SDG 12 must even exist is a damning indictment of our collective blindness to securing a viable future for humanity on this small, fragile planet we haveso pillaged. We urgently need a new sustainability revolution that redesigns both supply and demand. The roadmap is here. Delivering it is the great challenge of our generation.
