Here is a detailed academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), written from the perspective of renowned journalist and author Hugo Young:

The Clarion Call for a Revolution in How We Consume and Produce  

By Hugo Young

In our relentless pursuit of economic growth and material abundance, humanity has embarked on a path of wanton overconsumption and profligate waste that is nothing short of ecocidal. We mindlessly extract finite natural resources, manufacture disposable products designed for built-in obsolescence, and discard them into overflowing landfills and polluted oceans with reckless abandon. This blithe disregard for the planet's ecological limits is condemning future generations to a dystopian existence marked by environmental degradation, resource depletion, and existential climate threats. It is a tragic intergenerational injustice of catastrophic proportions.  

The scale of the crisis is nothing short of mind-boggling. Over 90% of biodiversity loss is caused by the extraction and processing of natural resources. The linear "take-make-waste" model embedded in our globalized economy accounts for a staggering 92 billion tonnes of materials consumed per year – a figure set to double by 2060 on our current trajectory. This inexorable rise in material footprints is depleting the world's resource base at an unsustainable rate.

Meanwhile, the blight of food waste sees almost a billion tonnes of edible food discarded every year – a perverse immorality when 690 million people globally still go hungry. The squandering of embedded resources, water, energy, labor, and capital invested in producing this wasted food represents one of the greatest market failures of modern civilization. It is a monumental indictment of the inefficiencies hardwired into our globalized food systems.

The manufacturing sector is similarly afflicted by systemic inefficiencies, lacking circular economy principles and closed-loop production models. Industrial facilities spew out noxious effluents, leaching heavy metals, chemicals, and other toxins into waterways and exposing local communities to severe health risks. Archaic combustion technologies contribute to the pall of air pollution that claims 7 million premature deaths annually. Is this the vision of modernity and progress we want to bequeath to posterity?

Rampant overconsumption, fueled by the pernicious forces of wealthy individualism and unchecked corporate greed, has become a scourge devouring the planet's natural capital. The top 1% of the world's population lays claim to over twice as much of the global share of household wealth as the bottom 50% combined. This grotesque inequity concentrates massive resource consumption among rarefied elites while billions eke out an existence in conditions of relative deprivation.  

Rapacious corporations compound this injustice. Motivated by perverse incentives fixated on short-term profits and shareholder returns, they peddle gratuitous consumerism through the incessant marketing of unnecessary goods and services. This orchestrated culture of overconsumption turbo-charges our resource depletion, waste generation, and environmental fallout. Sinisterly, these same profit-driven entities wield inordinate lobbying power over timorous governments, neutering the very policies and regulations desperately needed to foster systems change.

Clearly, maintaining the unsustainable status quo will only further unravel the planetary systems that sustain life itself. To avert societal and ecological collapse, we must heed the galvanizing call embodied in Sustainable Development Goal 12 and trigger a renaissance in how we consume and produce as a global civilization.  

This transformation demands a fundamental decoupling of economic growth from resource extraction and waste generation through a decisive transition towards circular economic models predicated on resource efficiency, waste prevention, product reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling. We must overhaul linear value chains, reconfiguring industry around the ethos of regenerative, closed-loop production cycles that return materials into perpetual technical or biological nutrient streams. Renewable energy and clean technologies are critical enablers of this paradigm shift towards zero-waste, low-carbon industrial ecosystems. The focus must be on dematerialization, doing more with fewer virgin resources through lightweighting, maximizing product lifespans, and repurposing waste streams as value-added inputs for other production processes.

On the consumption side, we need a grassroots cultural renaissance driving the adoption of minimalist lifestyles oriented around conscious consumption, sharing economies, product-service systems, and preferences for access over ownership. Stemming the fetishization of materialistic overconsumption demands a profound reset of our societal value systems, prioritizing human wellbeing, life satisfaction, and spiritual fulfillment over crass materialism and retail therapy. Sustainable public procurement and green fiscal instruments like environmental taxes also have vital roles in incentivizing behavioral changes among producers and consumers alike.  

None of this is fanciful idealism – there are already pioneering companies and communities across the world putting the principles of the circular economy into practice, decoupling growth from environmental degradation. We must amplify these beacons of sustainable innovation through policy intervention, public-private partnerships, awareness campaigns, and social movements until they become the new normal by 2030.  

Transitioning to sustainable consumption and production patterns is not just a moral and existential imperative – it is an $4.5 trillion economic opportunity replete with green jobs, sustainable growth prospects, and development co-benefits like improved health outcomes. It represents our best hope for achieving inclusive, equitable prosperity within planetary boundaries and safeguarding a habitable biosphere for generations to come.  

So the choice is clear – doubling down on the impoverished delusion of infinite growth premised on rapacious consumption and extraction of our planet's dwindling resources. Or a bold new vision of flourishing anchored in circular, regenerative systems that restore natural capital while meeting human needs. Only by urgently answering SDG 12's rallying cry for a decisive civilizational reset in how we consume and produce can we forge a sustainable world of abundance for all. This generation's moral courage – our willingness to upend the status quo – will determine the fate of posterity and life on Earth as we know it.
