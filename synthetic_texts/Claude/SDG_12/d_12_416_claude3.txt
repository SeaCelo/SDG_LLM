As a leading global network dedicated to promoting and protecting the rights of older persons, HelpAge International recognizes the pivotal role that Sustainable Development Goal 12 (SDG 12) plays in ensuring a sustainable and equitable future for all generations. SDG 12, which aims to "ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns," is inextricably linked to the well-being and empowerment of older persons worldwide.

The rapidly aging global population presents both challenges and opportunities in the context of sustainable consumption and production. Older adults, particularly those in low- and middle-income countries, often face disproportionate vulnerabilities due to limited access to resources, inadequate social protection systems, and marginalization from decision-making processes. However, their wealth of knowledge, experience, and traditional practices can offer invaluable insights into sustainable living.

One of the critical areas where SDG 12 intersects with the needs and contributions of older persons is in the realm of food systems. Unsustainable agricultural practices, coupled with the impacts of climate change, threaten food security and nutritional adequacy for older populations. Traditional farming methods, passed down through generations, can provide guidance on sustainable and resilient food production techniques, while ensuring the preservation of cultural heritage and biodiversity.

Furthermore, older persons can play a vital role in promoting responsible consumption patterns within their communities. Their lived experiences and wisdom can inform strategies for reducing food waste, promoting reuse and recycling, and advocating for sustainable lifestyle choices. By leveraging their influence as respected community members, older adults can serve as ambassadors for sustainable consumption, fostering intergenerational dialogue and knowledge transfer.

However, achieving sustainable consumption and production patterns requires addressing the unique challenges faced by older persons. Limited mobility, financial constraints, and lack of access to information and technology can hinder their participation in sustainable practices. Targeted interventions, such as age-friendly infrastructure, inclusive policies, and capacity-building programs, are essential to empower older persons as active agents of change.

Moreover, the transition towards a circular economy presents both opportunities and risks for older workers. While new green job opportunities may emerge, older adults may face barriers to reskilling and employment in these emerging sectors. Comprehensive strategies that promote lifelong learning, skills development, and age-inclusive workplaces are crucial to ensuring older persons can contribute to and benefit from the shift towards sustainable production models.

HelpAge International recognizes the need for a holistic and intergenerational approach to achieving SDG 12. By fostering collaboration between older persons, policymakers, businesses, and civil society organizations, we can harness the collective wisdom and experiences of all generations to drive sustainable consumption and production patterns. Inclusive policies, targeted capacity-building initiatives, and participatory decision-making processes are essential to ensure that the voices and needs of older persons are integrated into sustainable development efforts.

Through our global network and partnerships, HelpAge International remains committed to amplifying the contributions of older persons in achieving SDG 12. By leveraging their traditional knowledge, fostering intergenerational dialogue, and advocating for age-inclusive policies and practices, we can create a future where sustainable consumption and production patterns are not only a reality but also a catalyst for the empowerment and well-being of older generations.
