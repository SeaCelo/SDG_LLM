Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), written from the perspective of George Will:

The Morality of Sustainable Consumption and Production  

By George F. Will

The United Nations has promulgated 17 Sustainable Development Goals to be achieved by 2030, a vapid exercise in moralbuttering—slathering an unctuous rhetorical glaze over the mundane matter of human behavior modification through government policies. Of these goals, perhaps the most insidious is SDG 12, which calls for "responsible consumption and production patterns."

On its face, this may seem benign, even laudable. After all, does anyone wish to be irresponsible regarding the bounties of creation and the means of economic production? But the agenda underlying this SDG is more subversive than the anodyne language lets on.

The implicit premise is that existing consumption and production behaviors are reckless and unrestrained—a wanton despoliation of environmental resources enabled by profit-seeking enterprises. This reflexively denigrates the market's ability to rationally allocate resources and harness ingenuity in furtherance of the greatest massbenefit. It betrays the arrogant supposition that a cadre of bureaucratic social engineers can centrally optimize the compound vector of global economic activity. 

Thus, the overarching objective is to impose top-down resource constraints through government coercion—sumptuary laws by other means—shrinking economic liberty to a shriveled portion of its necessary ambit. This neoclassical revanchism, a rebottled version of the comprehensive economic planning that inexorably led to the Soviet Union's tragic unraveling, is exactly wrong for achieving sustainable development.

True sustainability flows organically from free individuals interacting voluntarily through markets incentivized toward maximizing gains from trade. The rigors of competition spur innovations that use fewer resources per unit of economic output. The accumulation of widespread prosperity cultivates an educated citizenry that places intrinsic value on environmental amenities. Open trade integrates nations into a system of mutual accountability regarding responsible production methods.

In contrast, SDG 12 is rooted in the flawed conceit that appointed regulators possess preternatural wisdom to engineer patterns of consumption and production. Rather than unleash dynamic private ordering, it aspires to a crude, one-size-fits-all regimentation of planetary economic life by a planetary directorate of busybodies.

This is the path to stultification, not sustainable development. It reflects the anti-empirical superstition that resource depletion poses an existential threat, rather than recognizing the adaptive ingenuity that has routinely transformed natural constraints into feedstocks for human advancement.

A society solicitous of sustainable development should repudiate SDG 12's misplaced piety and embrace the real wellsprings of economic and environmental progress—the institutional predicates of personal and economic freedom. For consumption and production patterns beneficial to all, our watchwords should be Primum non nocere: First, do no harm to the spontaneous order of free people cooperating through voluntary exchange.
