Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) as if written by economist Andrei Shleifer:

The Governance of Sustainable Consumption and Production

By Andrei Shleifer

The 12th Sustainable Development Goal set forth by the United Nations calls for "ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns." This objective is critical for promoting efficient resource use, industrial development, and welfare gains across both developed and developing nations. However, achieving sustainable consumption and production hinges on effective governance and market design to align incentives for firms and consumers. 

The market failures impeding sustainable practices are well-known. Regulations aimed at internalizing environmental externalities through taxes or quotas can partially correct overconsumption of natural resources. But regulation is subject to influencing by powerful interests, as we've seen with lax enforcement of existing environmental laws in many countries. Cap-and-trade systems for emissions provide more flexibility and efficiency, but have been undermined by political pressures to overallocate permits. Command-and-control approaches also face information constraints compared to decentralized market mechanisms.

On the consumption side, information gaps contribute to undervaluing of future environmental costs by households. Firms have strategic incentives to obfuscate harm from unsustainable products. One policy approach is product labeling requirements. However, the behavioral economics literature shows prominence of present bias, inattention to small fees (like carbon taxes), and other psychological factors limiting sustainable choices despite complete information.

A more fundamental barrier is the public goods problem underpinning many sustainability challenges. Individual consumers and firms do not fully internalize the social benefit of their conservation efforts. Free-rider problems limit adoption of circular business models prioritizing reuse, recycling, and extending product lifecycles. Innovation is undersupplied for green technologies and sustainable product designs given spillovers.

To make progress toward SDG 12, we must recognize environmental preservation as a problem of institutional design and governance. Overcoming pervasive externalities, commitment problems, and free-rider dynamics requires structuring incentives beyond just prices. Social planners need a broader toolkit integrating behavioral insights, corporate governance reforms, financing mechanisms, and complementary institutional changes to facilitate collective action.

One approach is developing commitment devices to sustain conservation over time. For example, Chile successfully used transferable fishing quotas to avoid overfishing tragedies. A quota management system was instituted after previous collapses, securitizing extraction rights and assigning them to fishers with a financial stake in preserving biomass stocks. Coupled with monitoring technology like GPS tracking, this governance regime generated massive efficiency gains relative to command-and-control regulation. Applications of such property rights-based approaches merit further research for other resources like forests and land.

As with the fisheries example, transparency and accountability are critical for overcoming influence activities subverting sustainability rules. Information disclosure requirements have proven powerful in disciplines ranging from corporate governance to pollution control. Clearly defined outcome metrics that are publicly monitored can empower activism and facilitate stakeholder engagement to enforce standards. Technology platforms like distributed ledgers offer new accountability mechanisms for sustainable supply chains.

At the firm level, sustainable practices are fundamentally shaped by corporate governance and internal incentives. Agency issues separating ownership and control enable rent-seeking that overexploits common resources. But when governing institutions define sound property rights and accountability, private firms are also vehicles for innovation with sustainable technologies and circular production models that generate profits.

For emerging economies, such institutional development is essential to avoid the historic overconsumption of natural capital during industrialization that afflicted early developers. International partnerships for technology transfer, stakeholder engagement frameworks, and structuring appropriate capital financing terms can support sustainable industrialization leapfrogging outdated production methods.

Ultimately, SDG 12 depends on cohesive, context-appropriate governance regimes that harness not just prices but institutional rules to reshape incentives across multiple levels - households, firms, civic groups, and government entities. Developing such institutional capital remains the fundamental challenge. Like economic growth itself, sustainability is an incredibly complex derivative of the human-made order rather than some mechanical process following scientific prescriptions. Focusing on rules structuring incentives and organizational forms is crucial for navigating this complexity.
