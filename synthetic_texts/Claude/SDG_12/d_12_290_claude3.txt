Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), written from the perspective of renowned economist Martin Eichenbaum:

Achieving sustainable consumption and production patterns lies at the crux of our ability to maintain long-run economic growth while preserving environmental integrity. The traditional economic paradigm of perpetual consumption growth is fundamentally incompatible with the finite resources of our planet. As we extract materials and emit pollutants at an ever-increasing rate, the deleterious impacts on ecological systems and human welfare become increasingly severe. Sustainable Development Goal 12 represents a clarion call to radically transform the linear "take, make, waste" model that has dominated modern economies.

The economic impacts of unsustainable production and consumption are nothing short of staggering. By some estimates, the negative environmental externalities associated with current practices amount to over $7 trillion annually - a mind-boggling 13% of global GDP. Improper waste management alone costs the world economy over $2.5 trillion per year. Beyond these direct costs, there are profound long-term risks of natural capital depletion, biodiversity loss, and climate change destabilization that may incur incalculable future economic damages. It is thus imperative that we realign our economic incentive structures to internalize these external costs and promote more sustainable practices.  

A powerful policy lever involves reforming inefficient fossil fuel and agricultural subsidies that distort market prices. Such subsidies currently total over $700 billion annually - over 6% of global GDP. Phasing out these perverse subsidies in favor of green tax shifts can dramatically level the playing field for more sustainable products and services. We must also mandate full cost pricing regimes that incorporate environmental externalities, whether through cap-and-trade schemes, carbon taxes, or other Pigouvian pricing instruments.

On the consumption side, informational campaigns aimed at increasing consumer awareness about the lifecycle impacts of purchases can be effective when coupled with eco-labeling schemes. However, mere informational deficits are unlikely to be the primary driver of unsustainable consumption in wealthy nations. A largerculprit may be the prevalence of situational factors and environmental cues that promote over-consumption, from supersizing to buy-one-get-one marketing tactics. Future behavioral "nudges" utilizing insights from prospect theory and the study of heuristics and cognitive biases may prove a powerful complement to traditional economic incentives in steering consumption toward more sustainable levels.  

Ultimately, decoupling economic growth from unsustainable resource use will require no less than a fundamental reimagination of production processes themselves. We must transition toward a restorative, regenerative, and circular economic model, wherein waste is designed out of the system from the start. This entails revolutionary advances in industrial ecology, biomimicry, closed-loop manufacturing, product life extension, and systematic waste valorization. Leading companies have already realized massive cost savings and competitive advantages by embracing such "cradle-to-cradle" design philosophies.

Of course, the challenges of scaling such disruptive innovations globally should not be underestimated. Developing nations understandably prioritize economic growth and poverty alleviation over environmental quality in the short run. However, we must be cautious of the fallacy of basing global sustainability targets on the unrealistic fantasy of all countries achieving the same levels of affluence as today's wealthy nations with their egregiously unsustainable consumption patterns. A far more judicious long-term path involves leapfrogging to sustainable production systems from the start, bypassing the "pollute first, clean up later" development model of the past.  

Reconfiguring the enormously complex global economy along these more sustainable trajectories represents perhaps the preeminent challenge of the 21st century. It requires no less than a fundamental reorientation of the very axioms underpinning mainstream economic theory over the past century. The growth imperative, rooted in outdated Malthusian scarcity paradigms, must give way to a steady-state economic model focused on qualitative improvements in human wellbeing rather than perpetual quantitative expansion. By reconceiving prosperity through the lens of sustainable consumption and production, we can catalyze the radical transformations in technologies, policies and social norms required to maintain stable economic development within our planetary boundaries.
