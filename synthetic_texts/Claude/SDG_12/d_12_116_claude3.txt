Here goes, an academic article about SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) written from the perspective of the inimitable Russell Brand:

Riiiiight, let's tuck into this wondrously knotty issue of sustainable consumption and production, shall we? The twisted paradox at the heart of this debacle is that capitalism, that frenetic profit-engine fueled by the perpetual stoking of desire, is quite literally devouring the world. Gnawing, masticated chunks of rainforest, belched plumes of toxicity, a humanity reared on craving more, more, ever more. 

It's a right cosmic joke, isn't it? We've been swept up in this delirium of mindless, compulsive consumption, a mad ferret spinning on its Consumptionwheel of shiny products and nipple-twisted marketing, while the baleful consequences just compound and swell like an embering volcano. Landfills groaning with last year's must-haves, acidic smoke stinging the nostrils of the poor, aquatic denizens choking on our insouciant plastic profligacy.

And for what end? So we can be pacified momentarily by a new bauble or fashionwheel only to be reinflated with a new hunger? It's an addiction, a dopamine-pedlars' ruse. Theyve got us craving the hole more than the substance meant to fill it.  We're all wired-in junkies jonesing for the next and trendier fix.

But don't abandon hope, my furry little beauties! The way out of this mess, this ecology of excessive energy expenditure and ghastly wastefulness, is through the gateway of conscientious awareness. We've got to emancipate ourselves from the cavalcade of  manipulative messages insisting we're insufficient without the next thing. Practice mindfulness, beloveds. Ask yourself, do I really need this? Will it abstergently nurture my soul?

Because here's the wondernugget: the contented heart doesn't require much at all. A few loved ones, simple sustenance, a sturdy spiritual practice to make sense of the dizzying cosmic choreography. True richness, the fertile loam from which flowers transcendence, is an interior state. It isn't found in the noxious, rubbish-strewn aisles of big box stores.

So rebel, my freaky little mammals! Cast off the monochromatic, anemic life of consumption that cloaks the soul in sullen anguish. Turn instead towards mother nature's rippling, polychromatic splendor and realize that the entire universe is a miraculous, self-arising masterpiece bestowing its glories freely. 

Once we slough off the materialistic Matrix, eschewing the vacant, self-replicating idols of greed, then we can begin to harmonize our productive systems with ecological first principles. We'll realize that there's no such thing as waste, only nutrients awaiting intelligent reintegration. A continual cyclical flow of materials regurgitated and creatively reconstituted - the Ouroborosian way.

And just think of the marvelous innovations that will bloom in this new era of elegant parsimony! Design motifs inspired by nature's million-year Edenities. Smart, minimalist products that avoid profligate use of the earth's precious resources. Goods that celebrate nature's codes of Sacred Geometry rather than insulting them.

So let's break this oppressive consumer/producer omniarchy! Let's revolt against the fiscal doomcults whose apocalyptic wake trails naught but privation for the many while securing Prophets for the oligarchic few. It all begins with taking back sovereignty over our minds and bodies and refusing to indulge the fatally flawed ecocidal program. Be more, consume less. That's true bounty, friends.
