Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) as if written by advice columnist Carolyn Hax:

The Elephant in the Room That's Crushing Us All

Let's talk, shall we? I'm going to lay it out straight - our rabid culture of consumption is choking the life out of this planet, and we're all complicit. From the clothes cheaply made in sweatshops that we buy in bales, only to pitch most of them barely worn, to the processed foods wrapped in layers of unrecyclable plastic that we gorge on while sitting in gas-guzzling SUVs idling in the drive-thru line, we are drowning in our own wasteful excess. 

And the hard truth? We know it. We're well aware that our disposable diaper mentality toward stuff, food, energy, you name it, is incredibly harmful and unsustainable. Yet we still can't muster the willpower and discipline to curb our gluttonous ways.

Sure, we might dutifully separate the plastics from the paper for curbside recycling pickup. We might have switched to LED light bulbs and reusable shopping bags. But let's be real - these token efforts are about assuaging our guilty consciences more than actually changing the bigger systems. Because the bigger systems that enable and encourage this mountains-of-trash lifestyle, well, those are too tangled up in corporate profit motives for us to want to mess with them too much.

Who wants to be the first to stop buying all those snazzy new gadgets every year just because the old ones still work fine? Or to forsake fast fashion completely because it exploits poor overseas workers and buries the environment in microplastics? Or to grow and cook all our own food from whole ingredients, eschewing the effortless convenience of salty, sugary processed stuff? Not I, said the fly.

So instead we keep kicking that bloated, overstuffed can down the road, papering over the real issues with flimsy feel-good half-measures like Starbucks allowing people to borrow reusable cups for their milkshake-viscosity beverages. Because confronting our huuuuge consumption problem would force us as individuals and as a society to make hard choices and sacrifices that we somehow still don't think we have to make.

Well, I've got harsh news for you: We absolutely do have to make those choices and sacrifices, and the sooner the better. The jig is up, friends. The facts don't lie - between the toxic manufacturing pollution, the mountains of non-biodegradable waste choking landfills and oceans, the depletion of natural resources, and all the greenhouse gas emissions from all angles, our blithe negligence is quite literally killing this planet's ability to sustain life as we know it.

So what's it going to be? Do we finally get real and completely overhaul the way we produce and consume everything to make it a zero-waste circular model? Or do we keep fiddling away with bandaid solutions until we choke on our own refusal to change? The clock's ticking, and the trash is piling up. Let's get to work dismantling and rebuilding these broken systems before we're all buried in them for good.
