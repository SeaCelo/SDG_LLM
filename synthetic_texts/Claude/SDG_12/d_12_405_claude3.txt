The Center for Victims of Torture (CVT) recognizes the intrinsic link between sustainable consumption and production patterns, as encapsulated in Sustainable Development Goal 12 (SDG 12), and the devastating impact of torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment on individuals, communities, and societies. Torture and other forms of violence not only inflict immense physical and psychological trauma on survivors but also disrupt the fabric of societies, exacerbating inequalities, undermining human rights, and hindering sustainable development.

In regions affected by conflict and instability, the cycle of violence and displacement often disrupts traditional livelihoods, strains natural resources, and creates conditions ripe for exploitation and unsustainable practices. Refugees and internally displaced persons, who account for a significant portion of CVT's clients, are particularly vulnerable to the consequences of unsustainable consumption and production patterns, as they navigate precarious living conditions and limited access to resources.

CVT's holistic approach to healing and empowerment recognizes the interconnectedness of individual well-being, community resilience, and environmental sustainability. By addressing the root causes of violence and promoting sustainable livelihoods, CVT aims to break the cycle of trauma and create an enabling environment for sustainable development.

One of the key areas where CVT's work intersects with SDG 12 is in the promotion of sustainable agriculture and food security. In many post-conflict settings, traditional agricultural practices have been disrupted, and communities struggle to rebuild their livelihoods in a sustainable manner. CVT's integrated approach combines psychosocial support with vocational training and income-generating activities, empowering survivors to rebuild their lives while adopting sustainable agricultural practices.

For instance, in CVT's programs in the Democratic Republic of Congo, survivors of torture and conflict-related violence have been trained in sustainable farming techniques, such as agroforestry, crop rotation, and the use of organic fertilizers. These practices not only promote food security and income generation but also contribute to soil conservation, biodiversity preservation, and climate change mitigation.

Furthermore, CVT recognizes the importance of sustainable waste management and resource efficiency in promoting healing and resilience. In refugee camps and informal settlements, where many of CVT's clients reside, inadequate waste management and resource scarcity can exacerbate health risks, environmental degradation, and social tensions. CVT's community-based initiatives promote sustainable waste management practices, such as composting, recycling, and upcycling, while also fostering income-generating activities through the production of eco-friendly products.

One notable example is CVT's partnership with a women's cooperative in Jordan, where Syrian refugee women have been trained in the production of eco-friendly household cleaning products using locally sourced, biodegradable materials. This initiative not only promotes sustainable consumption and production patterns but also provides economic empowerment opportunities for these women, many of whom are survivors of torture and conflict-related violence.

Moreover, CVT's approach to sustainable development extends beyond direct interventions, as it recognizes the critical role of policy advocacy and capacity-building in promoting systemic change. CVT works closely with local and international partners to advocate for policies and practices that promote sustainable consumption and production patterns, particularly in post-conflict and humanitarian settings.

Through collaborative efforts with governments, civil society organizations, and international bodies, CVT contributes to the development of frameworks and guidelines that integrate sustainable development principles into humanitarian response and peacebuilding efforts. This includes promoting the adoption of sustainable procurement practices, the integration of environmental impact assessments in reconstruction efforts, and the promotion of green technologies and renewable energy sources in crisis-affected areas.

Additionally, CVT's expertise in trauma-informed care and resilience-building is instrumental in addressing the psychological and social barriers that often hinder the adoption of sustainable practices. By fostering individual and community healing, CVT empowers survivors and affected communities to embrace sustainable lifestyles and actively participate in the transition towards more sustainable consumption and production patterns.

In conclusion, CVT's work at the intersection of torture rehabilitation, sustainable development, and peacebuilding exemplifies the interconnectedness of the Sustainable Development Goals and the need for holistic, integrated approaches to address complex global challenges. By promoting sustainable livelihoods, resource efficiency, and environmental stewardship, CVT not only contributes to the achievement of SDG 12 but also lays the foundation for long-term resilience, reconciliation, and sustainable peace in conflict-affected regions.
