Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production, written from the perspective of economist Daron Acemoglu:

Ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns is one of the core challenges we face in promoting sustainable economic development and mitigating environmental degradation. As we have seen time and again throughout history, unconstrained economic growth and industrialization driven by profit motives alone can lead to catastrophic consequences for humanity if not balanced with responsible management of natural resources and byproducts. 

The traditional economic models premised on endless compound growth fail to account for the depletion of natural capital stocks and the accumulation of waste and pollution that inevitably arise from such levels of consumption and production. This flawed theoretical framework stems from a narrow conceptualization of technology as an exogenous factor, independent of economic incentives and institutions. However, once we recognize that technological change itself is an endogenous response to economic incentives shaped by political, legal and regulatory institutions, it becomes clear why unfettered laissez-faire economics generates technologies promoting excessive extraction and waste rather than sustainable production methods.

We are trapped in a "mal-consumption" cycle where market forces allocate resources toward products and processes that accelerate environmental degradation due to institutional failures to internalize environmental externalities. Firms innovate and adopt "mal-production" technologies that economize on private costs while ignoring massive social costs of pollution, natural habitat destruction, and climate change. Consumer demand follows the artificial price signals distorted by these externalities, reinforcing the cycle of unsustainable growth.

Overcoming these dynamics requires strategic investments, policies and regulations by development agencies and national governments to re-align private incentives with social objectives. Just as the industrial revolution emerged through coordinated institutional innovations incentivizing the development of manufacturing technologies, a sustainability revolution will require strategic support for innovations in resource efficiency, recycling, renewable energy, biodegradable materials, and closed-loop production cycles.

Developed nations must lead this transition given their historical contribution to the environmental crisis and their greater institutional capacities and resources. However, development policies must avoid forcing the sustainability burden disproportionately onto poor and developing nations, which would be a grave injustice given their minimal role in causing these environmental challenges. International cooperation, technology transfers, and innovative financing mechanisms are essential for developing economies to leapfrog into sustainable production techniques without compromising their economic growth prospects.  

Fundamentally rethinking our economic incentive structures and technological trajectories will not be politically easy given powerful vested interests benefiting from the mal-consumption status quo. But the human, economic and environmental costs of inaction are increasing exponentially. Market forces alone will not resolve this crisis - we must have the political will and institutional imagination to catalyze a sustainable industrial rebirth. Our long-term prosperity and ecological stability depend on meeting this challenge head on.
