Here goes, let's see if I can channel Dave Barry's irreverent wit to discuss the crucially important but admittedly dry topic of Sustainable Development Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production Patterns.

OK, let's just come right out and say it: We humans are a bunch of consumery little piggies. We love buying junk we don't need with money we don't have. But that's not the worst part. The real kicker is that after we get sick of our new toys, we toss them into the big global dumpster behind the 7-Eleven without a second thought. And I'm not just talking about the Furbies and Beanie Babies - although those were crimes against plush humanity. I mean actual toxic waste, cancer-causing sludge, and enough plastic to smother a small ocean.

It's no wonder the United Nations took a look around in 2015 and said: "Whoa, people! Let's try dialing it back a notch with this whole unsustainable binge-and-purge lifestyle." Thus was born Sustainable Development Goal #12: Achieve Responsible Consumption and Production Patterns by 2030. It's like the UN built a little eco-conscience into their blueprint for world peace and prosperity.  

Now the goal itself sounds pretty straightforward. Use resources more efficiently! Reduce food waste! Make sure people understand the whole reduce-reuse-recycle thing, already! But like most things involving humans, we've found creative ways to utterly undermine the spirit of SDG 12.

Take the concept of a "circular economy", which is basically an upscale term for not throwing away your junk. Companies are hopping on this trendy bandwagon by rebranding their manufacturing scraps as an exciting new business opportunity. "We took these defective rubber duckies, ground them into dust, and are now selling them to cement companies as filler! Zero waste!" That's great, except for the part where we're still making way more rubber duckies than any sane person could want or need.

Then there's the food waste issue, which is truly staggering. If food waste were a country, it would be the third largest emitter of greenhouse gases behind the U.S. and China. Every year, about a third of all food produced gets tossed in the trash before it ever reaches a human mouth. It rots in fields, gets crushed during shipping, or ends up as a hairy science experiment in the back of your fridge. Talk about an inefficient system!

And let's not even get started on greenwashing - that's when companies try to convince us they're eco-warriors by slapping the word "natural" on products made from 100% petroleum by under-paid workers. Or "sustainable" fashions that are really just made of recycled rags that will disintegrate into a pile of threadbare tears after two washings.

The truth is, we're all totally complicit in this global clown show of mindless consumerism. From the mining companies chopping up rainforests to the hoarders Dumpster-diving for more beanie babies, we all play a role. Even those of us who dutifully sort our yogurt containers and cans for recycling tend to buy more junk we don't really need in the first place.  

So what's the solution? Well, the authors of SDG 12 prescribe a whole bunch of actions like promoting public procurement practices that are sustainable, making sure companies report honestly about their impacts, phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, and educating consumers to make better choices. Basically grown-up stuff that's about as fun as a root canal.

But if we've learned anything from Dave Barry's wisdom over the years, it's that sometimes you just have to laugh at the absurdity of human behavior. We're a dizzying combination of ingenuity and stupidity. We put a man on the moon, but can't seem to stop buying fast fashion that will be out of style and in a landfill before you finish reading this sentence.  

So that's the great challenge of SDG 12 - finding a way to rein in our more idiotic impulses as a species through a combination of common sense and well-aimed satire. We may be mere decades away from drowning in our own discarded plastic junk, but at least we'll go out laughing at the epic cosmic joke of modern excess. Thanks, United Nations, for at least trying to slap some sense into us before it's too late. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go return some defective rubber duckies.
