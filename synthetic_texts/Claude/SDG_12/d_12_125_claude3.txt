Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) written from the perspective of Peter Hitchens:

The Illusory Quest for "Sustainable" Profligacy
By Peter Hitchens

Once again, the elevated minds of the United Nations have cloaked themselves in the garb of lofty ideals, this time under the guise of "Sustainable Development Goal 12" - a muddled rallying cry championing "responsible consumption and production patterns." Yet beneath its veneer of ecological altruism lies a tangled web of contradictions that betrays the very premise it claims to uphold.

At its core, this call to curtail our "environmental impact" is undergirded by the flawed assumption that human prosperity and economic growth are antithetical to environmental stewardship. The self-proclaimed planetary guardians would have us trade the furnaces of industry for a monastic existence of imposed austerity under the dubious promise of ecological renewal. What they fail to recognize is that true sustainability arises not from deprivation but from the innovation fostered by free markets and economic liberty.

The ill-conceived SDG 12 promotes a "circular economy" that exalts recycling and repurposing as panaceas to our alleged over-consumption. But in clinging to this reductive philosophy, the UN's mandarins neglect a fundamental truth – that real-world markets harmonize supply and demand far more efficiently than any centralized regime of resource rationing. The avalanche of recycled materials finds its way back into productive use organically, driven by the invisible hand rather than by bureaucratic fiat.

Moreover, this misbegotten goal presupposes that the mere act of consuming constitutes a moral failing, utterly disregarding the incalculable blessings that modern consumption has bestowed upon humanity. It was the fire of industry that lifted billions from the abyss of squalor, not the self-denial peddled by Western elites burdened by consciences oppressive. To denigrate the prosperity that flowed from smokestacks and assembly lines is to repudiate the very forces that liberated our ancestors from ceaseless drudgery.

Underpinning this entire exercise in ecological evangelism is a quasi-religious veneration of the natural world that borders on the idolatrous. We are incessantly admonished to "live in harmony with nature," as if the planet were some holistic entity to which we owe obeisance. Yet the natural world, for all its splendor, is also a realm of savagery where existence is perpetually precarious – a truth that the SGD's Edenic fantasies conveniently obscure.  

It is the mastery of our environment, not submission to it, that uplifted humanity from the forlorn existence our ancestors endured. Our modern technology, far from being a curse, has empowered us to bend the unyielding forces of nature to our sovereign will. To retreat from that hard-won dominion under the faddish guise of "sustainable development" is to recant the very triumphs that permit us to ponder such indulgences.

At its core, Goal 12 embodies the fundamental conceit of the sustainable development agenda – that an unelected cadre of bureaucrats can centrally orchestrate the complexity of billions of human lives more harmoniously than the organic interplay of free people pursuing their own ends through voluntary exchange. It is an arrogant wager against the proven genius of decentralized human cooperation, cloaked in the shimmering rhetoric of ecological salvation.

The path to true sustainability lies not in forsaking the glory of human industry, but in unleashing its creative dynamism while tempering its excesses through judicious governance and accountability. It is through freedom, not coerced privation, that we most fruitfully husband our resources while expanding the horizons of abundance. Any other pathway leads not to sustainability, but to the impoverished stagnation the UN's technocrats disingenuously profess to abhor.
