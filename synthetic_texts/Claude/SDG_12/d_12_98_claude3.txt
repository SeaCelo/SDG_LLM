Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) from the perspective of Tavleen Singh:

The Insatiable Hunger of India's Production & Consumption

By Tavleen Singh 

India holds grand ambitions of becoming a $5 trillion economy by 2025, fueled by unbridled production across sectors and unchecked consumption by its burgeoning middle class. However, this relentless pursuit of economic growth is exacting a monumental environmental toll that simply cannot be ignored any longer. The scale of waste generation, resource depletion, and pollution caused by our industries and individual consumption patterns is nothing short of apocalyptic. If decisive action is not taken immediately, we risk sliding into an ecological catastrophe of unimaginable proportions.

Our cities have become virtually unlivable, choking under the weight of plastic waste, sewage, smog, and carbon emissions. Delhi's air is more toxic than the emissions from 988 trucks operating for an entire year. The holy Ganga continues to be ravaged by 3 billion liters of untreated sewage discharged daily, even as the faithful flock to its banks to offer puja. The marine ecosystem of our vast coastline is under grievous assault, with over 300 million tons of plastic waste generated annually – a significant portion of which eventually finds its way into the oceans. Clearly, ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns has taken a backseat to profligate wastefulness in the name of progress.  

The tragedy is compounded by the fact that over 190 million Indians remain undernourished – a stark paradox in a nation plagued by grotesque food wastage and inefficient agricultural practices. Our soils are increasingly degraded and water tables depleted due to reckless overexploitation, even as the construction industry gobbles up fertile lands and minerals at an insatiable rate. The sheer scale of extraction, emissions, effluents, and garbage generated across the manufacturing sector is enough to make one's head spin. It seems we have confused development with mindless ruination in our quest for economic superpowerdom. 

Sustainable Development Goal 12 serves as a clarion call to usher in a new paradigm of responsible stewardship over our production systems and consumption patterns. It advocates for the adoption of sustainable practices across the entire supply chain – from extraction of raw materials through manufacturing processes to waste disposal. The push for circularity, resource efficiency, and waste minimization must be non-negotiable. Sustainable public procurement policies, awareness campaigns, corporate sustainability reporting, eco-labelling, and life-cycle analysis must become the norm rather than an afterthought. Critically, the message of SDG 12 demands that we decouple economic growth from environmental degradation.

Regrettably, on most targets under SDG 12, India's performance has been utterly abysmal. Our material footprint per capita and consumption of fossil fuels remain abysmally high, even as our recycling rates, sustainable industrial practices, and corporate sustainability mechanisms languish at abysmal levels. The sad reality is that India ranks a dismal 168th out of 180 countries on the Environmental Performance Index – a shocking indictment of our complacency and lack of commitment towards sustainability.  

It is time we awoke to the clarion call of SDG 12. Our nation's quest for breakneck industrialization and unrestrained consumerism threatens to push our ecological boundaries past the point of no return. Each of us – as individuals, corporations, and communities – must introspect on our culpability in perpetuating wildly unsustainable production and consumption practices. Systemic transformation is urgently needed, from revamping our education system to inculcate sustainability values, to radically redesigning urban infrastructures, to overhauling industrial processes with carbon neutrality and circularity as guiding principles. 

There are no easy fixes or shortcuts – widespread behavioral change, stringent regulations, and holistic adoption of sustainable practices across all sectors is the only answer. If not, I shudder to think of the dystopian future we are consigning our children to inherit. A nation ravaged by toxic air, barren lands,  dry aquifers, and oceans clogged with plastic detritus – in the relentless pursuit of mindless, selfish, and short-sighted economic gluttony. The choice before us is stark – shape up, or watch our Bharatiya dream unravel amidst an existential environmental calamity of our own making.
