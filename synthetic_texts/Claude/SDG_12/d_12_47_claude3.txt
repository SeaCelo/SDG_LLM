Here is a detailed response in the form of an academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) from the perspective of Peta Credlin, former chief of staff to Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott:

The Unsustainable State of Consumption and Production: A Conservative Critique

By Peta Credlin
Former Chief of Staff to Prime Minister Tony Abbott

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has set admirable goals for improving life around the world, but we must be pragmatic about which objectives are achievable and how to go about realizing them effectively. Sustainable Development Goal 12 - to "ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns" - represents a particular challenge that paradoxically requires restraint in overreaching policies aimed at dictating how people consume and businesses operate.

At its core, SDG 12 seeks to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation through improving resource efficiency and reducing waste. But its targets double down on ineffective top-down diktats about minimizing the alleged "footprint" of human activity. This paternalistic approach naively assumes bureaucrats can centrally plan the complexity of trillions of daily choices in the real economy better than the incentives and feedback of free markets.   

The record of centralized economic control - whether communist planned economies or corporatist mixed economies - is dismal for both human liberty and environmental quality. Rather than doubling down on similar failed approaches, policymakers should liberate the transformative power of competitive free enterprise, technological innovation, and private property rights to align private incentives with sustainable public goals. History shows that economic freedom correlates with environmental protection as people move from subsistence poverty into realizing non-material wants like clean air, water and natural spaces.

We know command-and-control regulations like plastic bag bans, disposable container taxes, single-use product restrictions, and prescriptive efficiency standards lack flexibility and inevitably create their own negative unintended consequences. These may include hardship for disadvantaged consumers, stifling design innovation, creating alternative disposal problems, incentivizing illegal activity, or distorting markets in opaque ways.  Governments embracing heavy-handed intervention based on static assumptions will be consistently outmaneuvered by the dynamism and resiliency of a global economy driven by billions of economic choices.

A more sustainable approach harnesses that dynamism through clear rules establishing resource pricing, property rights and liability for environmental damages. Rather than itemizing arbitrary lists of allowed or prohibited practices, this ensures all costs (including environmental externalities) are internalized into decision-making while empowering innovators, entrepreneurs and consumers to discover creative solutions continually raising living standards. Flexible, revenue-neutral policy tools like fee-bates create self-funding incentives to cut waste instead of bureaucratic diktats.  

Unleashing human ingenuity to do more with less is indispensable given rapidly rising global demand - the real sustainability challenge is about dramatically increasing affordable supply through resourceful methods and new technologies, rather than just restricting or rationing current means of production. Innovation expanding the pie avoids futile zero-sum games over slicing it.  A flourishing economy driven by capitalism's profit incentives and rule of law provides both the means and motivation for environmental protection while eradicating the endemic poverty exposure driving overconsumption in subsistence living.

Conservatives inherently grasp that humanity'sythical capacity for problem-solving is premised on economic freedom respecting pricing signals, property rights, and the rule of law - not artificial unitizing of consumption and production into arbitrary categories presuming a fixed, centrally-allocatable pie. Rather than grandiose intergovernmental diktats, sustainability is secured by locally-tailored incentives fostering dynamism in the messy reality of billions of decentralized choices comprising the global economy.

If implemented pragmatically based on sound economics respecting freedom and pricing feedback loops, the goals of SDG 12 could be a positive framework for progress. But doubling down on ineffective statist nannyism constraining human potential would only undermine sustainability itself - this path traveled has proved ruinous for too many nations already. For human flourishing reconciling economic growth with environmental stewardship, we must liberate rather than shackle the transformative engine of free enterprise.
