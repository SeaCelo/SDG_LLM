Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production, written from the perspective of Swapan Dasgupta, an Indian political commentator and Member of Parliament:

The Elusive Quest for Sustainable Lifestyles: Unpacking SDG 12 Through an Indian Prism

As India gallops towards economic preeminence on the global stage, propelled by the insatiable appetites of an aspirational middle class, a fundamental contradiction has emerged. On one hand, mass consumption fueled by affordable products has unlocked hitherto inaccessible comforts and conveniences for millions. On the other, this frenzy has catalyzed an ecological apocalypse of gargantuan proportions—a Faustian pact with nature that we can ill-afford.

The 12th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG), centered on "Responsible Consumption and Production," confronts this paradox head-on. Decoupling economic progress from environmental degradation has become the holy grail of our times. Yet, India's pursuit of this grail is mired in uniquestructural impediments—both inherited legacies as well as contemporary realpolitik.  

The colonial plunder of the subcontinent triggered a cycle of resource depletion and ensuing impoverishment that haunts us to this day. A nation coerced into exporting raw materials and agricultural commodities has struggled to achieve self-sufficiency, let alone sustainability. Rapid population growth amidst intergenerational poverty has exacerbated the strain on finite natural endowments. As development took root post-Independence, the focus was singularly on enriching livelihoods, often through resource-intensive industrialization.

More recently, the quest for a $5 trillion economy to elevate millions from destitution has necessitated hard bargains with environmental prudence. India's espousal of a 'Nationally Determined Contribution' with modest climate targets at COP26 reflects this predicament. The country's per capita emissions pale before those of advanced economies, and the 'carbon burden' of our exports compounds the inequity. Nonetheless, being the third-largest emitter globally bereft of a credible decarbonization roadmap has invited international approbation.  

India's federal architecture has also stymied concerted action on SDG 12. While the Central government has championed initiatives like 'Make in India' and Smart Cities to promote sustainable industrialization, their implementation is either half-hearted or reduced to Byzantine bureaucratic labyrinths. States have often prioritized attracting investments over environmental due diligence. Municipal councils grappling with mushrooming urban agglomerations have lacked the wherewithal to address perennial civic challenges like waste management, let alone contemplate circularity in production systems. Fragmented policies and uncoordinated ground realities have negated well-intentioned sustainability edicts.

The sociocultural landscape presents its own idiosyncrasies. Aspirations mirroring Western excess among the burgeoning middle class have collided with the realities of poverty enveloping rural hinterlands. Little surprise that the judicious mantra of 'Need over Greed' falls on deaf ears when basic needs themselves remain unmet for millions. The roots of sustainable consumption must be traced to habit formation in childhood—a challenge when public education systems have perpetually languished.

All is not lost, however. Indian civilization has indelible linkages with environmental stewardship. Ancient precepts of minimalist living and mindful resource utilization have endured in pockets of rural antiquity. Time-honored frugal innovations from the 'Jugaad' spirit offer hope. The nation's technological prowess, evident in its preeminence in fields like renewable energy and the circular economy, could catalyze sustainable transformations both at home and abroad.

Ultimately, India's sustainability discourse demands a reframing—from an onus of sacrifice to an ethos of inclusive development. Decoupling growth from depredation is a constructive path where developed and developing nations partake equitably. It behoves the global fraternity to not curtail the aspirations of half of humanity through unjust environmental propositions. On its part, India must nurture a cadre of conscious consumers transcending regressive binaries, through enhanced climate education, sustainable urbanism, and policy harmonization. Only then can the utopia of 'Need over Greed' be realized as a vehicle for ecologically-conscious prosperity for all. The journey is arduous, but the fruits imperative – for us, and our progeny.
