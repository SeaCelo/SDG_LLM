Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production, from the perspective of economist John List:

The overconsumption of resources by modern human societies poses an existential threat to the long-term sustainability of life on this planet. As the world's population continues to grow and developing nations strive to attain higher living standards, the demand for energy, food, water and other natural resources will only intensify. Sustainable Development Goal 12 - to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns - represents one of the core challenges facing humanity in the 21st century. We simply cannot maintain our current trajectory of inefficient resource use and wasteful linear consumption models. A paradigm shift is required, guided by principles of circular economies, renewable resource flows, and comprehensive life-cycle externality valuations.

The market failures that have given rise to our unsustainable production systems are numerous - information asymmetries, uninternalized externalities, time-inconsistent preferences, and more. Overcoming these will require a coordinated portfolio of interventions cutting across policies, technologies, procedures and human behaviors. Economic instruments like carbon taxes, cap-and-trade systems, and subsidy realignments have critical roles to play in steering firms and individuals toward more sustainable practices. But these must be complemented by investments in innovative technologies, smart urban planning, and corporate supply chain transformations that radically increase resource efficiencies.

On the consumption side, decades of research in behavioral economics have illuminated the cognitive biases, heuristics and social norms that lead consumers toward overconsumption and wasteful habits. Present bias, conspicuous consumption, choice overload, and a lack of feedback systems all contribute to unsustainable decision making. Nudging strategies informed by this research can help realign individual behaviors, but more institutional approaches may be required - everything from product certification schemes to outright bans on particularly toxic materials.

In many domains, the most sustainable "products" may be services that provide similar functional benefits with radically lower material throughput. The transition toward a sharing economy for products like vehicles, homes and household goods is already underway, albeit nascent. But unleashing these models will require overcoming cultural norms, economic incentives, and regulatory barriers around ownership and property rights dating back centuries.

Developing nations face additional challenges as they attempt to industrialize and provide adequate nutrition, housing and energy access for their populations. Too often, environment agendas have been portrayed as impediments to economic advancement, when in reality sustainable production methods can be engines for new forms of innovation and job creation. Investment in distributed clean energy like solar, recycled materials markets, sustainable agriculture intensification and next-generation public transit systems can serve the dual priorities of higher living standards and environmental preservation. Financing and technology transfers from developed nations will be critical enablers.

The scope and complexity of this challenge is immense, implicating product designers, firms, consumers, governments, investors and every actor in the global economy. But the centrality of natural resource use to all human productive activity means that solutions to overconsumption represent the core opportunity of sustainable development. Cross-disciplinary approaches drawing upon economics, psychology, engineering, ecology and earth systems science will be required. With concerted effort, humanity can reorient its resource use and ensure the sustainability of both production and consumption for generations to come. The stakes could not be higher, nor the challenge more vital.
