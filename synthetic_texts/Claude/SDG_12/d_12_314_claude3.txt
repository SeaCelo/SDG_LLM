On behalf of the Chilean Agency for International Cooperation, it is an honor to present this comprehensive analysis of Sustainable Development Goal 12 (SDG 12): "Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns." This goal is essential to addressing current global challenges, fostering a systemic shift toward more sustainable and resilient practices.

Unsustainable consumption and production are major drivers of natural resource depletion, environmental degradation, and the growing ecological footprint. According to the United Nations, if the global population reached living standards similar to those of the wealthiest countries, it would require the resources of three Earths. This reality is unsustainable and jeopardizes future generations' ability to meet their needs.

SDG 12 tackles this issue from multiple angles, advocating a transition to a circular economy that maximizes resource efficiency and minimizes waste. This entails adopting innovative approaches throughout the product lifecycle, from design to waste management.

A cornerstone is the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources, including reducing food waste. According to FAO estimates, one-third of all food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted annually, representing an economic loss of approximately $940 billion. Addressing this challenge requires coordinated actions across the supply chain, from production to consumption.

Another critical aspect is the adoption of more sustainable consumption and production practices by governments, businesses, and consumers. This involves promoting energy efficiency, reducing the use of toxic materials, incorporating renewable energy, and implementing environmental management systems.

Businesses play a key role in this transition, as their production and marketing decisions significantly impact the environment and society. Adopting circular economy approaches, such as designing products for reuse and recycling, can generate cost savings and create new business opportunities.

Similarly, consumers must be empowered to make informed and responsible choices. This requires improving access to information about the environmental and social impacts of products and fostering education and awareness about the benefits of sustainable consumption.

Chile has made significant progress in this regard, such as implementing the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) Law and the National Organic Waste Strategy. However, there is still a long way to go to achieve a full transition to sustainable consumption and production patterns.

Strengthening partnerships and cooperation among the public, private, and civil society sectors is crucial to driving this agenda forward. Additionally, increased investment in research, development, and innovation is needed to generate more sustainable technological solutions and business models.

In summary, SDG 12 represents an urgent call to rethink our consumption and production patterns, acknowledging planetary boundaries and promoting a holistic and systemic approach. Only through collective action and the adoption of sustainable practices can we ensure a prosperous and resilient future for present and future generations.
