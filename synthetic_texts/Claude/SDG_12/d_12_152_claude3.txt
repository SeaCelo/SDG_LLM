Here is a detailed academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), written from the perspective of Gail Collins:

The Unsustainable Gluttony of the Modern World 

By Gail Collins

Let's be honest, we're drowning in our own excess. The developed world's insatiable hunger for consumption has become nothing short of grotesque. We gorge ourselves on an endless buffet of shiny new gadgets, fast fashion trends that are outdated in a season, and disposable everything—all fueled by a rabid culture of materialism. The result? A tidal wave of waste that's choking the planet.

It's reminiscent of those old Monty Python scenes where members of the aristocracy practically asphyxiate on their own gluttony, stuffing their gullets until they're near bursting. Except in this case, the excess isn't limited to the privileged few—it has become the norm across huge swaths of society. We're all complicit in this wasteful frenzy, mindlessly devouring resources while the environmental bill piles ever higher.

The statistics are staggering. Each year, an estimated 1.3 billion tons of food is wasted globally. One truck's worth of textiles is burned or sent to the landfill every single second. If we keep Going green this path, there will be more plastic in the oceans than fish by 2050. It's madness.

And the root cause? Our own lizard brain impulses for novelty, status, and instant gratification—honed over millennia to help our ancestors survive, now manipulated by corporate behemoths to turn us into compulsive consumers. We're perpetually seduced by the hot new phone, the trendy new outfit, the constant churn of upgrades and replacements. All while the previous shiny object gets discarded into the waste heap, a crumpled husk of our fleeting desires.

The folly is especially maddening given the scale of human need lingering in pockets all over the world—places where basic necessities like clean water, food security, and decent housing remain elusive. Think of the resources squandered on frivolous, disposable luxuries in Beverly Hills alone that could dramatically improve life for struggling communities from Appalachia to sub-Saharan Africa. It's enough to make you sick.

Of course, none of this is to suggest we should all start living like ascetic monks, forsaking all joys and conveniences. Life's pleasures and small indulgences are what make the human experience vibrant. The problem is the utter lack of restraint, discipline, and mindfulness in modern consumption habits.  

We've become bratty children whingeing over the latest iPhone when much of the developing world would be overjoyed to have reliable electricity or internet access. We toss aside perfectly good clothing because it's no longer on-trend, rather than finding creative ways to reuse, repurpose, or hand it down. We buy far more food than we can possibly consume, leading to staggering amounts landing straight into the trash bin.

Basically, we've become the bloated, corpulent aristocrats of yore—prisoners to our own cravings and excess. Blind to the landfills overflowing just outside the castle gates. As with most societal ills these days, the solution requires both top-down policy interventions and bottom-up cultural shifts.

Governments must get serious about implementing incentives, regulations, and public education campaigns to radically rein in waste and irresponsible production methods. Corporations must be held accountable, their feet held to the fire, for building sustainability and resource efficiency into their business models from the ground up. 

And all of us everyday citizens need to do some serious soul-searching in the mirror about realigning our consumption habits with our supposed personal values around environmental protection and global human dignity. It's time to embrace repurposing, reusing, fixing, thrifting, and mindful purchasing as societal norms—ditching the disposable, throw-away culture for good.

Because at this rate, we're strapping an ever-growing anchor of waste and pollution to the collective human ship, dragging us into increasingly uncharted waters of ecological peril. We can't keep wallowing in our own gluttony while the planet suffers a slowly tightening noose. It's time to sober up and get our grotesque appetites under control.
