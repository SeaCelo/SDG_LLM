Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) as if written by Luigi Zingales:

The Sustainable Development Goal of Ensuring Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns: A Capitalistic Critique

By Luigi Zingales

The 12th Sustainable Development Goal laid out in the United Nations' 2030 Agenda calls for a radical shift toward more responsible patterns of consumption and production on a global scale. On its surface, this goal seems innocuous enough - an attempt to promote resource and energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure, and an environmentally-conscious economic paradigm. However, upon deeper inspection from the lens of capitalistic theory, SDG 12 reveals concerning undertones of government overreach and unnecessary market intervention.

At its core, SDG 12 emerges from the flawed premise that unconstrained free markets are inherently wasteful and destructive to the natural environment. This viewpoint presupposes that governments can somehow centrally plan and mandate business practices in a manner that is more "sustainable" than what would organically arise from the voluntary interactions of producers, consumers, and market forces. Such a top-down, command-and-control approach to orchestrating economic activity should raise red flags for any free market thinker.

The private sector already possesses immensely powerful incentives to increase efficiency and reduce wasteful inputs. Why? Because such economizing behavior is crucial to maintaining a competitive edge and maximizing profits. We've seen time and again how market competition breeds constant innovation toward more sustainable processes and products that meet evolving consumer demands. Just look at rapid advances in renewable energy sources, emission reduction technologies, recycling systems, and eco-friendly product offerings. Government mandates are not required to compel such progress.

Moreover, one could easily argue that underdeveloped nations should be focused on lifting their populations out of poverty first and foremost, before devoting excessive resources to satisfying those countries' perceived environmental obligations. Introducing onerous sustainability regulations too early could stifle the economic dynamism and growth needed to increase standards of living. Wealthier is healthier, as the aphorism goes. Why should we deny the global poor the same opportunities for mass industrialization, consumption, and resource exploitation that wealthy nations have already enjoyed? That seems grossly unfair and paternalistic.

Implicit in SDG 12 is an ominous undercurrent of central planning and hostility toward free markets. It treats the private sector as something to be restrained and micromanaged by governments to limit consumption and funnel economic activity into sanctioned "sustainable" channels. But this is a chilling denial of consumer sovereignty and a violation of free choice. If consumers voluntarily want to engage in patterns that others deem "irresponsible," that is their prerogative - not something for bureaucrats to dictate. Businesses already have incredibly potent incentives to reduce inefficiencies, curtail waste, and offer affordable, responsible products. We should let the market take the lead.

Furthermore, the indicators used to measure progress toward SDG 12 appear worryingly subjective and susceptible to perverse regulatory creep that could strangle economic freedom over time. Everything from "material footprint" to "fossil-fuel subsidies" to "companies publishing sustainability reports" are cited as criteria for evaluation. Yet these metrics leave ample wiggle room for ever-expanding mandates on businesses under the guise of sustainability. Today a company is pressured to issue sustainability virtue signaling, tomorrow they may be hit with Byzantine new compliance edicts, onerous fines, or restrictions on their activities. There is no natural limiting principle once we enable centralized control over business operations.

To be clear, my critique here should not be misconstrued as a blanket repudiation of environmental protection or resource conservation. Those are noble goals that capitalism itself incentivizes through cost savings and consumer demands. But there is a vast chasm between responsible environmental stewardship and the bureaucratic diktats envisioned under SDG 12. The former occurs naturally as part of the free market process, while the latter circumvents the market altogether under hubristic assumptions of efficient, benevolent direction.  

We should let consumers reveal their true environmental preferences through their purchases rather than have those preferences prescribed through one-size-fits-all edicts. Businesses will readily adapt to deliver on genuine market demands for responsible products and sustainable practices. Profit motives are already compelling that outcome. Governmental interventions, however well-intentioned, run severe risks of distorting the dynamic forces of free market capitalism toward optimal efficiencies and reduced waste. After all, as my mentor Milton Friedman famously said: "The world runs on individuals pursuing their separate interests." Attempting to centrally-plan global sustainability goals through regulatory fiats is a fool's errand that will encumber economic freedom and human progress. We should tread very carefully.
