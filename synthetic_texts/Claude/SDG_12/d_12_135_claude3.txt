Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production, written from the perspective of satirist Mark Steel:

Sustainable Development Goal 12: Ensure Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns
By Mark Steel, PhD in Ironic Studies

We live in a world of excessively wasteful and frankly idiotic production and consumption habits, my friends. Just look around you - single-use plastic packaging being hurled directly into landfills before your very eyes, truckloads of perfectly edible food being binned because it's past some arbitrary "best before" date, and gargantuan factories belching out untold quantities of pollution and greenhouse gases in the name of making endless tat that will be landfill in a year.  

It really takes the biscuit when you look at the statistics. Did you know that a staggering one third of all food produced globally is lost or wasted? That's almost a billion tons of food literally thrown in the bin every year! Meanwhile, nearly 700 million people globally are going hungry. You couldn't make it up. The colossal inefficiency and careless squandering of resources in our supply chains would make a Soviet-era breadline look like a model of streamlined productivity.

And don't get me started on the scourge of cheap, disposable consumerism that corporations have indoctrinated us into. I went into my local everything-for-a-quid shop the other day and came out with 17 plastic kazoos, a radioactive glow-in-the-dark frisbee, and enough single-use tableware to service a Ghenghis Khan-sized horde. Perhaps I could take it all on a nice vacation to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch for old times' sake? 

Planned obsolescence - forcing products to become unusable through deliberate designs or software chicanery - that's another rich vein of corporate absurdity we've allowed to fester. I bought a new printer last year and after just 6 months, coincidentally just as the starter ink ran out, the ruddy thing refused to work unless I performed a arcane sequence of sacrificial dances while chanting in ancient Enochian! Lo and behold, the only place to buy new sacrificial ink cartridges was the printer manufacturer itself at 200 times the market rate for ink. It's stark raving corporate lunacy.

The solution, of course, is for us all to reduce, reuse, recycle, and push for a more circular economy with resource efficiency at its core. We need extended producer responsibility schemes so companies are on the hook for the environmental impacts across a product's full lifecycle. Increased corporate transparency and sustainable reporting standards would help reign in the current Wild West of green-washed marketing guff. And consumers like you and me must hold companies' feet to the fire - voting with our wallets, lobbying governments, and generally making more discerning choices.

But I'm probably just ranting again. Nobody takes an old curmudgeon like me seriously anymore. Why don't we all just go and buy a few more tons of disposable plastic rubbish to make ourselves feel better? The planet will still be here for our great-grandkids...right?
