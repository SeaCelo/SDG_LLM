The Materialist Malady: Overconsumption, Waste, and the Path to Sustainable Wellbeing 

By Polly Toynbee

The greatest existential threat we face is not climate change, nor biodiversity loss, nor poverty or inequality – though all are deeply worrying. No, the root cause underlying each of these crises is our culture of rabid overconsumption and obsessive materialism. We devour the planet's resources at an unsustainable rate, chewing through renewable and non-renewable stores to feed the capitalist machine. Like ravenous beasts, we tear into nature's bounty, gorging ourselves in the pursuit of more stuff – always more clothes, gadgets, cars, and plastic toys to line our nests. Yet no amount ever satisfies.  

The average British household now owns around 300,000 individual possessions. We can scarcely move for all the clutter. On top of this mountain of material excess, we discard billions of tonnes of waste each year from industrial processes, construction, electronics, food, and packaging. Some of it is recycled – a fig leaf to hide our wasteful habits – but the vast majority pollutes the earth, air and oceans, choking marine life or entombing future generations beneath our detritus. Even our homes groan under the sheer mass of discarded tat, which we hoard like misbegotten treasure. 

Is this really what progress looks like? To amass so much corporeal 'wealth' that our homes, communities, cities and planet can barely sustain the strain? Surely the advance of human civilization should mean using our ingenuity to live more lightly and sustainably – not burdening the earth with excessive, needless consumption on a ruinous scale.

The Sustainable Development Goals lay out a balanced path between economic progress and environmental security. But SDG 12 on Responsible Consumption and Production gets to the corrupted heart of the matter. It challenges the conventional wisdom that perpetual economic growth – fuelled by ever-increasing extraction and consumption of raw materials – is desirable or even possible on a finite planet. 

Instead, SDG 12 calls for a revolutionary rethink of how we produce, distribute and purchase goods and services. It demands a transformation of the linear 'make, use, discard' model of industrial capitalism to a more circular system that designs out waste, recaptures resources, extends product lifespans, and prioritizes access over ownership. Just as importantly, it aims to reshape the cultural values that equate human worth with material possession.

Nowhere is this materialist malady more prevalent than in the overconsumptive lifestyles of the global consumer class – those of us fortunate enough to have incomes far above subsistence level. We shop recreationally, accumulating stuff far beyond our basic needs. This compulsive acquisitiveness is socially reinforced through pervasive advertising, planned obsolescence of products, celebration of conspicuous consumption, and pernicious cultural associations between belongings and status.   

The impacts on personal wellbeing are pernicious too. Despite ever-higher living standards, anxiety and mental illness are rampant across wealthy nations. The wealthiest 20% of the world's population accounts for a staggering 86% of total private consumption expenditure – yet remains chronically unsatisfied. Our wants are stoked and multiplied by the titillation of acquisition, cultivating an endless cycle of desire and discontentment. This psychological hunger is hugely profitable for corporations, but deeply damaging for people and planet.  

Clearly the path to sustainable wellbeing lies not in accumulating more superfluous possessions, but in rediscovering non-materialistic sources of meaning, purpose and happiness. Indigenous cultures often have far richer intangible 'wealth' in terms of community cohesion, spiritual affiliation, and sustainable stewardship of nature. These are the values the world urgently needs to re-embrace and scale up.  

Of course, implementation of SDG 12 goes far beyond just changing personal attitudes. It requires transformative policy interventions to correct market failures, remove incentives for wastefulness, tax pollution and emissions, extend producer responsibility for product lifecycles, overhaul industrial processes for efficiency and circularity, strengthen sustainable procurement practices, and promote responsible advertising, eco-labelling and consumer education. 

Critics will say that such drastic reforms would inhibit economic dynamism and business competitiveness. But the opposite is true – unbridled overexploitation of nature cannot be sustained and is already causing massive future costs from environmental destabilization and resource insecurity. Nor have wastefulness and materialism fostered genuine societal wellbeing. SDG 12's vision of living more balanced, sustainable, sufficient lifestyles points the way to a happier, healthier and more equitable future in harmony with our finite planetary boundaries.    

Some might also dismiss SDG 12 as an unnecessary infringement of consumer choice and personal freedom. This is an intellectually bankrupt perspective based on hollow neoliberal dogma. We are not truly 'free' if our behavioural choices are incessantly manipulated by marketing, planned obsolescence and damaging social conditioning.

Ultimately, learning to consume and produce more responsibly is about reclaiming our autonomy as human beings with intrinsic self-worth beyond materialistic status seeking. It's about valuing quality over quantity, sufficiency over excess, and life's intangible riches instead of base gratification of impulsive appetites.  

And ultimately, eschewing the materialist malady is an ethical imperative if we wish to pass on a habitable planet for future generations and restore balance with the natural world that sustains us. This will require a profound cultural and economic renaissance – challenging, certainly, but well within our human capabilities. The alternatives of environmental calamity or sacrificing our humanity to soulless consumerism are too bleak to contemplate.
