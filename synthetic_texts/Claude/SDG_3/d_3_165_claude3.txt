Here's a detailed academic article about SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) written in the provocative, satirical style of Carl Hiaasen:

Fever Swamp: A Delirious Dive Into Our Sick Healthcare System

You think Florida is a whacked-out state? It's downright convalescent compared to the feverish hellscape that is America's healthcare industry. We're talking an intricate realm of insurance Shylocks, opioid cartels, fake cure hucksters, and big pharma Fat Cats laughing all the way to their Swiss chalet money bins. It's enough to make you hack up a lung.

Let's start with SDG 3, the one about "good health and well-being." Sounds so warm and fuzzy, right? Like a "Get Well Soon" balloon next to the hospital bed. Except this particular bed is a flaming dumpster engulfed by the runaway greed of our demented healthcare-industrialized complex.

We're the wealthiest nation on earth, yet over 30 million of our people have no health insurance — no coverage, no care, nada. It's like the Hunger Games where only the rich survive. But at least Katniss got a pointy arrow to defend herself. The uninsured in the U.S. are like sitting ducks for every plague that blows through town.

Meanwhile, the well-to-do upper crust lives in a medical Garden of Eden. Walk-in clinic? Nope, it's a "concierge healthcare facility" with a juice bar stocked by Gwyneth Paltrow's personal shaman. Get sick? A quick finger snap and Dr. McDreamy flies over from the Mayo Clinic in a Gulfstream IV for a house call.

But it's not just access that's skewed. There's a whole cesspool of crookedness tainting our vaunted system of science and healing. Like the pharmaceutical giants hawking their FDA-approved Fearmongoxitron to cure a disease they basically invented. Don't believe it? Just ask the Lippy Institute of Minnesota, funded entirely by Fearmongoxitron's manufacturer.

Oh, and about those meds — aren't prescription drugs supposed to make you better? Tell that to the thousands who get hopelessly addicted to opioids every year because doctors were ill-prepared medical dopes. Gramps throws out his back raking leaves and next thing you know he's riding shotgun for the Mexican Menudo Cartel smuggling pills across the border.

Maybe the purest scam of all is the whole "alternative medicine" grift — every manner of crystals, herbs, oils and incantations pushed by hemp-muumuu-clad charlatans. It's like a Taliban yard sale hawking overpriced hokum to the desperate and gullible. Hey, maybe smearing guano paste on your chakra will cure cancer. Slap some Native American lingo on that sucker and charge $200 a pop.

Yet we keep guzzling this fountain of snake oil because our healthcare system breeds such distrust and alienation. A rusty, greed-fueled behemoth that cares more about profits than people. No wonder so many are turning to that old, tarnished jalopy called "hope."

Maybe it's time we put down the chamomile tea, ditch the Sedona vortex healing tour, and demand real fixes. An honest system that covers everybody, roots out corruption, and focuses on prevention rather than overpriced reaction. Because here's the scary diagnosis: our national health hangs in the balance.
