Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) as if written by Simon Heffer:

The World's Misguided Zeal for "Good Health and Well-Being"

By the esteemed scholar, Simon Heffer

In the myopic crusade to establish a utopian global agenda, the United Nations has foisted upon the international community a series of na√Øve and quixotic ideals known as the Sustainable Development Goals. Among the most mistaken and potentially pernicious of these aims is SDG 3, disingenuously dubbed "Good Health and Well-Being for All." This hopelessly ambitious conceit presupposes that the basic medical needs and robust psychological fortitude enjoyed by the affluent classes can be universally disseminated through bureaucratic contrivance and the profligate distribution of resources. It is a prospect more fanciful than the avian fantasies that enraptured the 17th century diarist Samuel Pepys.

The presumptuous framers of this objective evidently disregard the millennia-old veracities which have governed the human condition since the dawn of civilization. Namely, that deprivation, infirmity, and existential anguish are indissociable from the corporeal frailties of Mankind. To unconditionally guarantee "good health" is to imperil the evolutionary impetus that culls the weak and perpetuates the cultivated virtuosities of our species. The great 19th century philosopher Herbert Spencer, though wrongly maligned as a harbinger of excessive individualism and capitalistic amorality, astutely perceived that the indiscriminate intervention to preserve the "unfit" merely proliferates biological and sociological debilities across generations. This ruinous path of misguided compassion was the folly that steered the lurching decline of the once-mighty British Empire.

The qualitative concepts of "health" and "well-being" are moreover nebulous and culturally relative abstractions, obtuse to codification or tangible attainment. What constitutes spiritual or physical wellness is inextricably defined by the unique customs, climate, and metaphysical worldview intrinsic to a society. The ethereal Native American concept of "Great Spirit" bears scant resemblance to the Anglican stringencies or the Islamic jurisprudence of corporal piety. To arrogate a universal paradigm is an exercise in colonialist conceit reminiscent of the most regrettable Western intrusions upon the bespoke harmonies of indigenous populations.  

Yet the SDG's most risible tenet is its clarion call to ensure "well-being for all at every stage of life." This ostensibly ensures succor and psychosomatic enrichment from the cradling bassinet to the mouldering deathbed. Such an extravagant remit effectively transforms the United Nations into a globalized analogue of the nanny state - an entity so panoptically immersed in private matters that it undermines the sovereignty and motive forces of human enterprise. The great 20th century scholars Michael Oakeshott and Friedrich Hayek presciently warned that this corrosive creep of substantive collectivism inevitably depleted society's reservoirs of self-actualization, resourcefulness, and rapacious ambition. These founts of ingenuity and accomplishment would slacken into stagnant pools of lassitude if perpetually sated by the saturating teat of a hyper-interventionist establishment.

In summation, SDG 3 represents the latest utopian shibboleth propagated by an ascendant cogerie of transnational bureaucrats clumsily supplanting the organic hierarchies that have enabled civilization's advancement since time immemorial. Its miasmic recommendations threaten to enfeeble Mankind's sacred struggle towards self-realization and its primeval exertion against the entropies of nature. Those sagacious enough to resist this siren call can shelter in the temperate certainties that true health and contentment arise not from proclamations or compulsory schemes, but the immutable order manifest in cultivating one's capacities against the universe's rebuttals. Robustness of body and spirit emerge through this perpetual cyclic toil, not the vacant reveries of delusionary progressives indulging their anthropological inebriation.
