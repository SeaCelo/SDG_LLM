The International Fertilizer Development Center presents this expert analysis on Sustainable Development Goal 3: Good Health and Well-Being, with a focus on the critical nexus between food systems, fertilizers, and human health.

Nutritious and sufficient food is foundational for human health, making sustainable agriculture and food production a prerequisite for achieving SDG 3. However, current industrial agriculture practices often prioritize yield over nutritional quality, relying heavily on synthetic fertilizers. While boosting crop yields, excessive or imbalanced fertilizer application can degrade soil health, contaminate water sources, and reduce the nutrient density of foods – all posing threats to human health.

Ironically, malnutrition and nutrient deficiencies affect over 2 billion people globally, even in regions with surplus caloric production. This "hidden hunger" results from diets lacking essential vitamins and minerals, weakening immune systems and cognitive development in children. Fertilizing agricultural systems with a narrow range of macronutrients fails to replenish micronutrients in depleted soils, propagating nutritional insecurity. 

Mitigating this requires a systems approach promoting soil health through integrated fertilizer management combining judicious synthetic inputs with organic amendments like manures, composts, and locally-adapted technologies like rock phosphate deposits. Balanced fertilization enhancing micronutrient availability in crops could be a cost-effective solution to malnutrition. For example, zinc-enriched fertilizers in Turkey increased grain zinc concentrations by 12-23%, providing over 50% of daily zinc needs from bread alone.

Fertilizers also impact human health via environmental pathways. Excessive nitrogen fertilization and manure runoff contaminate water bodies with nitrates linked to "blue baby syndrome" and certain cancers. Overapplication of phosphate fertilizers contributes to surface freshwater eutrophication, enabling toxic algal blooms and dead zones. Case studies from the U.S. Midwest's agricultural heartland illustrate how implementing nutrient management plans through fertilizer best practices and precision agriculture could drastically reduce nutrient loading to the Gulf of Mexico Dead Zone.

Furthermore, the fertilizer industry's reliance on fossil fuels for manufacturing contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change – magnifying environmental stresses like droughts, floods, and heat waves that undermine crop production and food security. Climate-smart fertilizers and renewable ammonia production could mitigate these health threats while enhancing climate resilience and sustainability.

Optimizing fertilizer use is therefore vital for promoting sustainable food systems delivering nutrient-rich diets, minimizing environmental contamination, and supporting climate change adaptation – all pillars of good health and well-being. Cross-sectoral collaboration engaging agricultural researchers, policy makers, industry, farmer groups, and health experts is imperative to harmonize fertilizer development and application with human and environmental health priorities under SDG 3. Only through an integrated One Health approach recognizing agriculture and fertilizers as indivisible from human, animal, and ecosystem health can we achieve the 2030 Agenda's holistic vision for people and planet.
