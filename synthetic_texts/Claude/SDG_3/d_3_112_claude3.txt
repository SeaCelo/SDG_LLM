Good health and well-being are fundamental human rights and vital enablers for sustainable development. As the Director-General of the United Nations Office at Vienna (UNOV) and a global leader in the field of public health, I have dedicated my career to advancing SDG 3 – ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages.

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development recognizes that health is not merely the absence of disease but a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being. This holistic approach to health is essential for unlocking human potential and fostering inclusive, equitable, and prosperous societies. However, despite significant progress, persistent and emerging health challenges continue to impede our collective pursuit of this ambitious yet imperative goal.

Globally, we are grappling with the unfinished agenda of communicable diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, which disproportionately affect the world's most vulnerable populations. Simultaneously, we are confronting the escalating burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes, fueled by rapidly aging populations, urbanization, and lifestyle factors. These dual burdens strain already overstretched health systems, exacerbating existing inequities and impeding progress towards universal health coverage (UHC).

Moreover, the increasing frequency and severity of public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have exposed the fragility of our global health security infrastructure. The pandemic has not only caused unprecedented loss of life but has also disrupted essential health services, reversed hard-won gains in maternal and child health, and exacerbated mental health challenges globally. It has underscored the urgent need for resilient health systems capable of responding to emerging threats while maintaining essential services.

Addressing these multifaceted challenges requires a comprehensive and multisectoral approach that goes beyond the traditional boundaries of the health sector. We must recognize the inextricable links between health, education, gender equality, clean water and sanitation, decent work, and sustainable cities, among others. Achieving SDG 3 is contingent upon progress across the entire 2030 Agenda, as health is both a precondition and an outcome of sustainable development.

Consequently, our efforts must focus on strengthening health systems, with a particular emphasis on primary health care and community-based interventions. We must prioritize investments in health workforce development, infrastructure, and supply chain management to ensure equitable access to essential medicines, vaccines, and health technologies. Simultaneously, we must address the social determinants of health, such as poverty, gender inequality, and environmental degradation, which perpetuate health disparities and undermine progress towards SDG 3.

Innovative financing mechanisms, such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and public-private partnerships, are crucial for mobilizing the resources required to achieve universal health coverage and address the health needs of the world's most marginalized populations. However, these efforts must be complemented by robust governance and accountability frameworks to ensure transparency, efficiency, and impact.

Equally important is the need to harness the power of data and digital technologies to inform evidence-based policymaking, monitor progress, and drive continuous improvement. The use of real-time data and predictive analytics can enhance disease surveillance, enable targeted interventions, and optimize resource allocation, ultimately improving health outcomes and resilience.

Achieving SDG 3 is not merely a moral imperative but a strategic necessity for sustainable development. Healthy populations are the foundation of thriving economies, stable societies, and a sustainable future for our planet. By investing in health, we are investing in human capital, unlocking the potential of individuals, communities, and nations to prosper and contribute to a more equitable and resilient world.

As we navigate the complexities of the 21st century, we must embrace a paradigm shift in our approach to health – one that recognizes the interconnectedness of our world and the shared responsibility we bear for the well-being of all people. Only through collective action, innovative partnerships, and a unwavering commitment to leaving no one behind can we realize the transformative vision of SDG 3 and create a healthier, more prosperous, and more sustainable future for all.
