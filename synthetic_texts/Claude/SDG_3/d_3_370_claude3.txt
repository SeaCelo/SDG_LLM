Achieving good health and well-being for all, as envisioned by Sustainable Development Goal 3, is intrinsically linked to the realm of work and employment. The International Labour Organization (ILO) recognizes that employment conditions, occupational hazards, and access to essential services significantly impact individual and public health outcomes. This analytical report examines the multifaceted interplay between SDG 3 and the world of work, underscoring the urgent need for concerted efforts by governments, employers, workers, and multilateral organizations.

Occupational health and safety remain pressing concerns, particularly in hazardous industries and informal sectors where regulatory oversight is limited. Exposure to toxic substances, ergonomic risks, and inadequate safety measures contribute to a staggering annual toll of work-related injuries, illnesses, and fatalities. The ILO's fundamental conventions and comprehensive standards, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Convention (No. 155), provide a robust framework for safeguarding worker well-being. However, effective implementation and enforcement remain challenging, especially in developing nations with limited resources and capacity.

Psychosocial risks, including workplace stress, violence, harassment, and burnout, have emerged as significant threats to mental health and well-being. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these issues, highlighting the need for comprehensive strategies that promote positive work environments, work-life balance, and access to mental health support services. The ILO's initiative on Workplace Well-being aims to address these challenges through social dialogue, policy guidance, and capacity-building efforts.

Access to affordable and quality healthcare services is a fundamental determinant of good health and well-being. However, many workers, particularly those in the informal economy or precarious employment arrangements, lack access to essential healthcare services and social protection systems. The ILO's Social Protection Floors Recommendation (No. 202) calls for the establishment of nationally defined basic social security guarantees, ensuring access to essential healthcare and income security, thereby contributing to SDG 3's objectives.

The intersection of work and health extends beyond occupational risks and access to healthcare. Gender equality, decent work opportunities, and income security also play critical roles in promoting health and well-being. Women workers often face multiple challenges, including gender-based discrimination, unequal pay, and limited access to social protection, which can have profound consequences for their health and that of their families. The ILO's efforts to promote gender equality, eliminate discrimination, and ensure equal opportunities and treatment are essential for achieving SDG 3.

Moreover, the informal economy, characterized by precarious working conditions, lack of social protection, and limited access to healthcare, poses significant challenges to achieving SDG 3. The ILO's Transition from the Informal to the Formal Economy Recommendation (No. 204) provides guidance for facilitating the transition to formality, thereby improving working conditions, social protection coverage, and access to essential services.

Collaborative efforts involving tripartite constituents (governments, employers, and workers) and strategic partnerships with international organizations, civil society, and the private sector are crucial for addressing the complex challenges at the intersection of work and health. The ILO's unique tripartite structure and its mandate to promote social justice and decent work make it well-positioned to facilitate dialogue, develop policies, and implement programs that contribute to the achievement of SDG 3 and other interlinked goals.

In conclusion, the International Labour Organization recognizes the inextricable link between the world of work and the attainment of good health and well-being. By promoting occupational safety and health, fostering positive work environments, facilitating access to healthcare and social protection, advancing gender equality, and supporting the transition from informality, the ILO plays a pivotal role in advancing the realization of SDG 3. However, sustained commitment, innovative solutions, and collaborative efforts across stakeholders are essential to overcome the multifaceted challenges and ensure a future of decent work and universal well-being.
