Ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages is a fundamental imperative that underpins the broader pursuit of sustainable development. As a preeminent scholar in the field of asset pricing and portfolio management, I recognize the inextricable link between economic progress, financial stability, and the attainment of robust public health outcomes.

The intertemporal capital asset pricing model (ICAPM) posits that investors demand compensation not only for bearing systematic risk but also for hedging against unfavorable shifts in future investment opportunities. Drawing a parallel, we can conceptualize the global community as a vast portfolio of interconnected nations, each contributing its unique assets – human, natural, and economic resources – to the collective endeavor of achieving sustainable development. Just as investors seek to maximize their utility by optimizing risk and return, the global community must strive to mitigate the risks posed by prevailing health challenges while capitalizing on the immense returns that accrue from investing in robust healthcare systems and promoting universal well-being.

The COVID-19 pandemic has served as a stark reminder of the profound economic consequences that can arise from overlooking public health vulnerabilities. The shockwaves propagated through financial markets, disrupting global supply chains, and exacerbating existing disparities in access to healthcare services. This crisis has underscored the necessity of adopting a multifactor approach to assessing and managing risk, one that accounts for the complex interplay between economic, environmental, and social determinants of health.

Akin to the Fama-French three-factor model's incorporation of size and value factors to enhance explanatory power, we must broaden our lens to encompass the multidimensional drivers of health outcomes. Factors such as access to clean water and sanitation, nutritional adequacy, environmental exposures, and socioeconomic disparities must be integrated into our risk assessment and mitigation strategies.

Furthermore, the concept of portfolio diversification holds valuable lessons for the pursuit of SDG 3. Just as investors diversify their holdings to reduce idiosyncratic risk, the global community must promote a diverse array of interventions, spanning preventive, curative, and rehabilitative measures. This diversification strategy not only mitigates the risks associated with over-reliance on any single intervention but also enhances the resilience and adaptability of healthcare systems in the face of evolving challenges.

Investing in robust healthcare infrastructure, bolstering research and development initiatives, and fostering international collaboration are akin to strategic asset allocation decisions that can yield substantial long-term returns. By prioritizing these investments, we enhance our ability to anticipate and navigate future health crises, thereby safeguarding the well-being of populations and preserving the foundations upon which sustainable economic growth is built.

Moreover, the concept of efficient market hypothesis (EMH) can be adapted to highlight the necessity of ensuring equitable access to healthcare services. Just as efficient markets rapidly incorporate new information, rendering it challenging to consistently outperform the market, an efficient global health system should rapidly disseminate and democratize access to life-saving interventions, treatments, and preventive measures. Inequities in access to healthcare not only undermine the ethical principles of fairness and justice but also represent a profound inefficiency that impedes our collective progress toward achieving SDG 3.

In conclusion, the pursuit of SDG 3 is not merely a moral imperative but a strategic investment in the long-term prosperity and resilience of our global portfolio. By leveraging the insights and frameworks from the field of finance, we can better understand the intricate interrelationships between health, economic growth, and sustainable development. As stewards of this shared endeavor, it is incumbent upon us to adopt a multifaceted, risk-conscious approach, one that recognizes the centrality of universal well-being to the preservation and enhancement of our collective assets.
