Good health and well-being have long been intertwined with economic progress, though the relationship is complex and multifaceted. As a leading voice in international economics, I feel it is crucial to examine Sustainable Development Goal 3 through the lens of macroeconomic policy and global systemic risk. 

At its core, SDG 3 represents a recognition that robust health systems and universal access to quality care are fundamental public goods, indispensable to human capital formation and long-term growth sustainability. The 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic offered a sobering case study - market failures in the provision of regional public health engendered catastrophic spillovers, disrupting trade, travel, and investment flows across vast swathes of West Africa. The human toll was immense, but so too were the economic repercussions, with the World Bank estimating over $2.8 billion in forgone output in 2015 alone for the three countries at the epicenter.  

And yet, the implicit assumption that health expenditures necessarily "pay for themselves" by unlocking higher growth merits scrutiny. Financing the vast investment needed to achieve SDG 3's expansive targets may well exacerbate thorny public debt dynamics in developing economies already contending with narrow tax bases. The risk of excessive health outlays proving fiscally destabilizing looms, particularly in an era of hardening budget constraints and costly demographic pressures. As my research with Carmen Reinhart illuminated, protracted debt overhangs impose hefty costs, depressing investment, distorting capital allocation, and leaving economies dangerously vulnerable to risk premia shocks.

A more nuanced approach is needed - one recognizing health as a unique market failure that transcends simplistic cost-benefit calculus. Pandemics, antimicrobial resistance, and the soaring prevalence of non-communicable lifestyle diseases all represent insidious negative global spillovers, with the developed world hardly insulated. Creative multilateral policy coordination and novel risk-sharing mechanisms may be required to overcome endemic underinvestment in global public health goods.

The economic ramifers encompass more than just public finance fragilities. SDG 3 also speaks to perennial growth theory debates overpopulation dynamics, environmental limits, and long-run technological frontiers. The Green Revolution staved off Malthusian catastrophe in the 20th century, but questions linger over carrying capacities for the planet's ecosystems. Human flourishing hinges not just on longevity increases but sustained multidimensional progress - from improved nutrition and sanitation, to expanded educational attainment and participatory rights.  

Ultimately, the "gospel of global health" intrinsically resonates, with few more fundamental metrics of thriving societies than robust public health infrastructure and broad access to quality services. But embedding the aspirations of SDG 3 within a coherent, sustainable international policy paradigm will require careful navigation of complex economic tradeoffs. As we strive to universalize the pillars of human welfare, we must retain a sharply analytical perspective on growth models, public finances, and systemic risk transmissions. Only then can we pragmatically advance this most humane of objectives without succumbing to intractable unintended consequences.
