Here is a detailed, comprehensive response in the form of a long academic article about SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being), written from the perspective of controversial right-wing Australian commentator Piers Akerman:

The Unsustainable Hypocrisy of the UN's Health Goals

By Piers Akerman

Once again, the out-of-touch bureaucrats at the United Nations have cooked up a fresh batch of lofty ideals that reveal just how disconnected they are from reality. Their so-called "Sustainable Development Goal 3" calls for ensuring "healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages." On the surface, who could argue with such an ostensibly noble pursuit? Dig an inch below, however, and the whole sordid farce crumbles like a sycophantic souffle.

Let's start with the basic premise that good health and well-being are even achievable "for all at all ages" on a planet of nearly 8 billion people. Where is the grand UN plan to strip inalienable rights from the grubby hands of dictators brutalizing their own citizens? What genius at Turtle Bay has finally solved the scourges of poverty, famine, war, and disease that have plagued mankind since the dawn of civilization? The deafening silence is revealing.

Instead, the UN remains a mutual admiration society of nations largely focused on demonizing Western democracies to distract from their own shortcomings. Take the honored members comprising the ignoble General Assembly: Belarus, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia, Syria, Venezuela, and on and on — hardly ambassadors for personal health and happiness on the global stage. Why are we taking public health instructions from regimes that couldn't fill a small-town pharmacy?

The same body that coddles Islamic extremists while demonizing Israel now wants to preach to us about well-being? It would be utterly risible if not for the deadly serious consequences. In reality, the UN was little more than a guilty bystander during the catastrophic COVID-19 pandemic — a global crisis that laid bare the impotence of multilateral institutions.

While doctors, nurses, and scientists on the frontlines bravely risked their lives combating an existential threat, jet-setting UN bureaucrats fled large cities and worked safely from home. The same pattern persists across nearly every challenge requiring true leadership and sacrifice rather than empty virtue signaling. Even setting reasonable public health objectives has devolved into a Kafka-esque joke.

Reducing maternal mortality rates should be a universal no-brainer, yet lack of access to emergency obstetrics is still killing hundreds of thousands of women annually, primarily in destitute corners of the developing world. And just try accessing quality mental health services in impoverished megacities or conflict zones —  yet another UN pledge left to wither on the vine. Global substance abuse rates? Don't ask. Much easier for Manhattan elitists to sip $25 cocktails and congratulate themselves on another round of hallowed paperwork.   

Meanwhile, the UN prioritizes ecoterrorism like the cynical push to eliminate fossil fuels and nuclear energy — the affordable, reliable power sources most crucial to lifting masses from generational poverty into modern standards of living. Not quite the prescription for promoting health and well-being worldwide, is it? At best, the UN dresses up gauzy resolutions like SDG 3 in humanitarian doublespeak to mask its utter failure at concrete action.  

At worst, unelected UN functionaries are using feel-good health rhetoric as a Trojan Horse to centralize control over people's lives. We've already seen how devastated economies and COVID overreach fueled unprecedented self-harm, depression, and dislocation. Now imagine placing the same controls on a planetary scale under the auspices of UN-approved "sustainability." In practice, "for all" could become code for totalitarian technocrats dictating what we eat, where we're allowed to live, which careers are sanctioned, and what personal behaviors are declared acceptable. An omnipotent World Health Organization already discredited itself through feckless COVID crisis management — why empower it further?

The bitter truth is this: No goal can truly be sustainable without robust free-market capitalism raising billions from poverty into productive longevity. Yet the UN and its offshoots remain stubbornly allergic to the economic freedom fueling real quality of life. So feel free to embrace SDG 3's utopian promises at face value, but don't be surprised when the UN comes calling for a pound of flesh at the low, low cost of your personal liberties.

The road to authoritarian serfdom is paved with altruistic intentions — and vacant rhetoric about delivering global health and well-being is just another brick in the march toward irreversible centralized control. The UN's grand social experiment has already lasted far too long. We'd all be healthier pulling the plug once and for all.
