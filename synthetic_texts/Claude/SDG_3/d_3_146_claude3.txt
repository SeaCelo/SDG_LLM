Ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages – the clarion call of Sustainable Development Goal 3 – is a task of monumental proportions, one that demands a radical rethinking of our approach to global public health. As a renowned scholar of law, security, and human rights, I have borne witness to the inextricable links between health, conflict, and sustainable development. My extensive fieldwork in conflict zones has laid bare the devastating impact of violence, displacement, and the breakdown of public health systems on vulnerable populations.

The global burden of disease is a scourge that respects no borders, exacerbated by the growing specter of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, environmental degradation, and the pervasive inequities that persist across and within nations. Achieving SDG 3 requires a paradigm shift – one that recognizes health as a fundamental human right, a prerequisite for sustainable development, and a potent force for fostering peace and stability.

Drawing upon my expertise in human security, I posit that true progress towards SDG 3 hinges on a holistic, multidisciplinary approach that addresses the social, economic, and political determinants of health. We must confront the harsh reality that conflicts and humanitarian crises remain the greatest impediments to global health, perpetuating cycles of poverty, displacement, and disease. The devastating toll of modern warfare extends far beyond the battlefield, decimating healthcare infrastructure, disrupting essential services, and sowing the seeds of long-term physical and psychological trauma.

To forge a path towards SDG 3, we must reframe health as a crucial component of human security, inextricably linked to the preservation of life, dignity, and well-being. This paradigm shift demands that we prioritize the protection of healthcare workers and facilities, enforce international humanitarian law, and hold accountable those who weaponize disease or target medical personnel and infrastructure.

Moreover, we must recognize that health emergencies – whether fueled by conflict, climate change, or infectious disease outbreaks – are inherently transnational threats that demand a coordinated, multilateral response. The global community must bolster its capacity for early warning, risk assessment, and rapid response, underpinned by robust surveillance systems and a renewed commitment to pandemic preparedness.

Crucially, we must confront the glaring inequities that undermine global health efforts, exacerbated by entrenched poverty, discrimination, and a lack of access to quality healthcare. The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare the stark disparities in health outcomes, highlighting the urgent need for universal health coverage and a concerted effort to strengthen health systems in low- and middle-income countries.

Achieving SDG 3 demands a fundamental reimagining of our approach to global health, one that transcends traditional siloes and embraces a comprehensive, human-centric paradigm. We must forge innovative partnerships that harness the power of technology, data, and evidence-based policymaking, while fostering community engagement and empowering marginalized populations.

In my years of fieldwork, I have witnessed the resilience of communities in the face of unimaginable hardship, their determination to rebuild and heal a testament to the indomitable human spirit. As we strive towards SDG 3, let us be emboldened by their courage, drawing inspiration from their stories to forge a more equitable, sustainable, and healthier world for all.
