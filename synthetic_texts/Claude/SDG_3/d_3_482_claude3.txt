Here is a draft newspaper article about SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being), written as if for the Chicago Tribune:

The Path to a Healthier Chicago and Beyond: Achieving Sustainable Well-Being Through the UN's Global Goals

By Rachel Hirsch, Tribune Staff Writer

When we think about building a thriving, equitable society in Chicago and around the world, access to quality healthcare and the opportunity for good health cannot be overlooked. The United Nations' third Sustainable Development Goal - "Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages" - is a lofty but critically important target that demands our attention and action.

The numbers don't lie - our city and our nation have work to do when it comes to health equity and sustainable well-being. Over 11% of adults in Chicago report being in poor or fair health. The city's infant mortality rate of 7.4 deaths per 1,000 live births exceeds the nationwide average. And in some of our most economically disadvantaged neighborhoods, the average life expectancy tragically lags the city's wealthiest areas by nearly a decade.

These disparities are unacceptable. They are a stain on our city's reputation as a global destination and economic powerhouse - for how can we claim to be a "world-class city" when our citizens do not have access to the basic human right of good health?

The UN's SDG framework recognizes that sustainable development must be holistic and all-encompassing. Achieving health and well-being for all is inextricably linked to progress in areas like poverty reduction, quality education, clean water and sanitation, climate action, and more. By tackling interconnected issues through integrated strategies and policies, meaningful gains can be realized.

Fortunately, Chicago is home to world-renowned healthcare providers, prolific medical research institutions, cutting-edge tech innovators, and passionate community advocates who are aligned in their commitment to this Sustainable Development Goal. We must build on their efforts and learn from successful models like the city's Healthy Chicago 2025 plan aimed at addressing root causes of health problems and inequities.

Sustainable health goes beyond just affordable treatment - it requires promoting healthier environments and lifestyles. That means prioritizing things like cleaner air and water, safer neighborhoods, increased green spaces, access to nutritious foods, robust mental health resources, and opportunities for active living.

There are economic ripple effects, too. By improving population health, employability and productivity increase. The healthcare burden and associated costs for employers and government decrease. New markets for health products, services, and innovation flourish.

And in an era of climate change and increased disease transmission across borders, proactive investment in public health infrastructure, rigorous disease monitoring, and healthcare system redundancies is an issue of national security.

Realizing the UN's aspirational goal for health and well-being won't be easy - but it's an imperative worth fighting for. Chicago was once a leader in the public health movement that revolutionized urban living conditions in the Progressive Era. Today, it has an opportunity to reassert that mantle of leadership on the world stage by championing progress toward Sustainable Development Goal 3.  

Our city, our nation, and our world's future depend on it. Healthy lives and well-being aren't luxuries - they are human rights and the bedrock of thriving, resilient communities. This generation must usher in a new era of public health prioritization and action. The path forward begins here, with us, resolving to leave no one behind on the road toward equitable, sustainable well-being for all.
