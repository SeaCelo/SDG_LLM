The Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) recognizes the pivotal role of Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3) – "Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages" – in fostering inclusive and sustainable development across its member countries. As a leading multilateral development finance institution, the IsDB is committed to supporting its members in addressing the multifaceted challenges associated with achieving this goal.

The IsDB's approach to SDG 3 is rooted in the principles of Islamic finance, which emphasize socio-economic justice, ethical investment, and the promotion of human well-being. The Bank's interventions are guided by the Maqasid al-Shari'ah, a framework that prioritizes the protection of faith, life, intellect, progeny, and wealth. This holistic perspective informs the IsDB's strategies and initiatives aimed at improving healthcare systems, enhancing access to quality services, and promoting preventive measures to safeguard public health.

One of the IsDB's primary focus areas is strengthening healthcare infrastructure and capacity building in member countries. The Bank recognizes that robust and resilient healthcare systems are essential for ensuring universal health coverage and addressing the burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases. Through its financing instruments, technical assistance, and partnerships, the IsDB supports the construction and renovation of hospitals, clinics, and diagnostic centers, as well as the procurement of medical equipment and supplies.

Moreover, the IsDB places significant emphasis on human resource development in the healthcare sector. It provides scholarships and training opportunities for medical professionals, enabling them to acquire specialized skills and expertise. This investment in human capital contributes to improving the quality of healthcare services and fostering knowledge transfer within member countries.

In line with the Islamic principles of prevention and preservation, the IsDB actively promotes initiatives aimed at raising awareness and encouraging healthy lifestyles. This includes supporting public health campaigns, education programs, and community-based interventions that address issues such as maternal and child health, nutrition, and the prevention of non-communicable diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer.

Furthermore, the IsDB recognizes the interconnectedness of SDG 3 with other Sustainable Development Goals, particularly those related to poverty alleviation, clean water and sanitation, and sustainable cities and communities. The Bank's interventions adopt a multi-sectoral approach, acknowledging the social determinants of health and the need for integrated solutions. For instance, the IsDB supports water and sanitation projects that improve access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation facilities, thereby reducing the burden of water-borne diseases and contributing to better health outcomes.

In addition to its financing activities, the IsDB plays a crucial role in fostering knowledge sharing and promoting best practices among its member countries. It facilitates the exchange of experiences, expertise, and innovative solutions related to healthcare challenges, fostering South-South cooperation and strengthening regional collaborations.

The IsDB's commitment to SDG 3 is also reflected in its partnerships and collaborations with other international organizations, civil society groups, and the private sector. These strategic alliances leverage collective resources, expertise, and reach, enabling the Bank to amplify its impact and contribute to the global efforts towards achieving universal health coverage and promoting well-being for all.

As the global community continues to grapple with emerging health challenges, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases, the IsDB remains steadfast in its support for its member countries. The Bank's approach, rooted in Islamic principles and guided by the Sustainable Development Goals, ensures that its interventions are holistic, sustainable, and tailored to the unique socio-economic and cultural contexts of its members.
