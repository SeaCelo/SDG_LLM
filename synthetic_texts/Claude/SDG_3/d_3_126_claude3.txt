Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) from the perspective of Simon Jenkins:

In the Pantheon of Worthy But Nebulous Global Ambitions, the Sustainable Development Goals represent both a triumph of cooperative multilateralism and an equally monolithic millstone around the neck of practicality. Of these 17 admirable yet dauntingly broad targets, few encapsulate the inherent tensions and realpolitik compromises as acutely as SDG 3 – that of "ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages." This is the stuff of policy white papers and NGO workshops, the rallying cry for countless public health initiatives, and yet ultimately, an objective mired in the quicksand of definitional vagueness.

At its core, the good health and well-being agenda seems a statement of the patently obvious – who, after all, could oppose such unimpeachable aims, as lofty as they are unspecific? But therein lies the rub, for the devil, as always, obsesses over the minutiae. What precisely constitutes a "healthy life," how is "well-being" to be measured and compared across the socioeconomic and cultural kaleidoscope of humanity? These are not mere semantic quibbles, but fundamental stumbling blocks in the path towards SDG 3's utopian idyll.

Perhaps more insidious still is the implied universality – this notion that any one-size-fits-all conception of health and wellness can be equitably overlaid atop the world's teeming diversity. From the slums of Mumbai to the clinics of Mayfair, from the nomadic tribes of the Sahara to the hipster yoga parlors of Brooklyn, surely "good health" must mean wildly dissimilar things, shaped by the idiosyncratic prisms of lived experience, economic circumstance, and social mores.

And into this interpretive thicket we must plunge, for the metrics by which SDG 3's "success" will be judged rely utterly on first establishing meaningful baselines and the targets against which progress can be charted with statistical rigor. Here we cross the murky epistemological streams separating the commendably ambitious from the unfathomably vague: maternal mortality ratios, neonatal death rates, HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis incidence, the scourges of substance abuse and traffic fatalities – these provide welcome islands of specificity amidst the handwaving rhetoric of "health access" and "affordable medicines for all."

It is on these tangible, quantifiable sub-goals that the battering ram of data-driven policymaking can be brought to bear, supported by that unsleeping humanitarian brigade of NGOs, multilaterals, and activist billionaires united in their zeal to "move the needle," however incrementally. And there have been successes – the steady gains in life expectancy across the developing world, the halving of preventable child deaths since 1990, the dramatic rollback of HIV's lethal toll in sub-Saharan Africa.

But for every such victory lap, an equal and opposite phalanx of emerging adversaries – pandemics like COVID-19 that manifest the fragility of planetary public health preparedness, the simmering crisis of antimicrobial resistance, the exorbitant economic burden of non-communicable diseases like cancer, heart disease, and diabetes.

Tackling these implacable foes will require more than aspirational rhetoric and awareness campaigns; it demands the mobilization of scientific and policy resources on a scale arguably unprecedented in human history, nurturing a proactive culture of prevention over after-the-fact crisis management. This is the scope of the challenge embodied in SDG 3, shorn of its platitudinal packaging – the quixotic quest to safeguard the very survival of our species by radically reframing the relationship between human activities and their biological impacts.

For the cynic, it reeks of noble naivete, akin to poor Canute's injunction to the tides. For the optimist, it resonates as an overdue rebuke to our hubristic disregard for ecological limits. For my part, I perceive SDG 3 as that rarest of constructs – a necessary fiction, by which I mean an artificial contrivance indispensable to orientating moral and political compasses around an ennobling common cause, yet one whose specifics remain ever protean, eternally subject to revision and realpolitik horse-trading.

In this Escher-esque paradox, the true impact of SDG 3 may be less in its literal attainment – an irreducible impossibility given its sumptuous ambiguity – than in how it catalyzes new discourses, policies, and funding priorities around the sacrosanct societal imperative of health resilience. If this cavalcade of acronyms and targets provokes the right conversations in the right corridors of power, then its mission, however nebulously defined, will have been triumphantly accomplished.
