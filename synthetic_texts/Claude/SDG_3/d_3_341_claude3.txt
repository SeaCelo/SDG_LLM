The Palestinian International Cooperation Agency (PICA) presents its analytical report on the progress and challenges associated with Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3): Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.

Palestine's healthcare system has endured significant challenges due to the ongoing political instability and occupation, resulting in disparities in access to quality healthcare services and essential medicines. The blockade on Gaza has exacerbated the situation, leading to severe shortages of medical supplies and specialized healthcare personnel. Additionally, the fragmentation of the Palestinian territories has hindered the implementation of a unified and comprehensive healthcare strategy.

Despite these obstacles, Palestine has made notable strides in reducing maternal and child mortality rates, primarily through improved access to antenatal care, skilled birth attendants, and immunization programs. However, the prevalence of non-communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and diabetes, continues to rise, posing a significant burden on the healthcare system and highlighting the need for preventive measures and early detection.

Ensuring universal health coverage remains a formidable challenge, as a significant portion of the population lacks access to affordable and quality healthcare services. This is particularly evident in the Gaza Strip, where the healthcare infrastructure has been severely compromised by repeated conflicts and the ongoing blockade. The shortage of specialized medical personnel and the limited capacity of healthcare facilities have led to a reliance on external medical referrals, further straining the already limited resources.

Mental health is another area of concern, as the ongoing conflict and displacement have taken a toll on the psychological well-being of the Palestinian population, particularly among children and youth. Access to mental health services remains limited, and there is a pressing need for comprehensive mental health programs and specialized care providers.

The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the existing healthcare challenges, straining an already overburdened system and highlighting the importance of strengthening emergency preparedness and response capacities. The limited availability of vaccines and the logistical challenges of distribution have posed significant obstacles to achieving widespread immunization.

To address these challenges, PICA emphasizes the need for a multifaceted approach that involves:

1. Strengthening healthcare infrastructure: Investing in the construction and renovation of healthcare facilities, particularly in marginalized and underserved areas, is crucial. This includes equipping facilities with modern medical equipment and ensuring an adequate supply of essential medicines.

2. Building human resource capacity: Enhancing the training and retention of healthcare professionals, including specialized medical personnel, is essential to meet the growing healthcare demands. This can be achieved through partnerships with international organizations and academic institutions, as well as the establishment of specialized training programs.

3. Promoting preventive healthcare: Implementing comprehensive public health campaigns and educational initiatives to raise awareness about preventable diseases, healthy lifestyles, and early detection is crucial. This includes addressing risk factors such as smoking, physical inactivity, and unhealthy diets, which contribute to the rising burden of non-communicable diseases.

4. Enhancing mental health services: Developing a robust mental health support system, including counseling services and specialized care for trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder, is vital to address the psychological impacts of the conflict and displacement.

5. Strengthening emergency preparedness: Investing in emergency response capacities, including stockpiling essential medical supplies, developing contingency plans, and enhancing coordination with international aid organizations, is crucial to ensure resilience in times of crisis.

6. Promoting international cooperation: Fostering partnerships with international organizations, donor countries, and healthcare institutions is essential to secure funding, access to specialized expertise, and support for capacity-building initiatives.

7. Addressing social determinants of health: Tackling the underlying social, economic, and environmental factors that influence health outcomes is crucial. This includes improving access to clean water, sanitation, and adequate housing, as well as addressing issues of poverty, unemployment, and gender inequality.

PICA recognizes the interdependent nature of the SDGs and acknowledges that achieving SDG 3 is inextricably linked to progress in other goals, such as SDG 1 (No Poverty), SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 5 (Gender Equality), and SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation). A holistic approach that addresses these interconnected challenges is essential for ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all Palestinians, regardless of age or circumstances.
