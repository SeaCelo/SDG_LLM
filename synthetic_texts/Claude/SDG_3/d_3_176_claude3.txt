Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages), written from the perspective of Harold Meyerson:

The quest to achieve truly universal health coverage and promote well-being globally represents one of the great moral imperatives of our age. While immense progress has undoubtedly been made in improving health outcomes in both the developed and developing world over recent decades, unconscionable disparities in access to quality healthcare remain deeply entrenched. Nowhere is this more evident than in analyzing the profound inequities that exist both within and between nations.

Those residing in impoverished communities or fragile states afflicted by conflict and unrest face enormous barriers in obtaining even the most basic medical services. Lack of infrastructure, inadequate supply chains, and shortages of trained healthcare workers all contribute to extremely high rates of preventable deaths from infectious diseases, malnutrition, and complications during pregnancy and childbirth. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, a woman faces a 1 in 37 lifetime risk of maternal mortality – a staggering figure compared to just 1 in 7,800 in developed regions.  

Yet the accessibility crisis extends far beyond the world's most unstable corners. Even within wealthy OECD nations, including the United States, underserved populations confined to urban ghettos or rural enclaves suffer dramatically worse health outcomes compared to their more affluent counterparts. In America's Black Belt region, life expectancy trails the national average by as much as a decade. Unconscionable disparities in infant and maternal mortality divide communities just miles apart.  

Achieving SDG 3 necessitates addressing these entrenched imbalances through a targeted, equity-focused approach. Comprehensive reforms are needed to bolster primary care infrastructure, enhance disease monitoring and response capabilities, and cultivate a professionalized health workforce in underserved areas worldwide. But healthcare access alone is insufficient – we must confront the socioeconomic determinants driving adverse health outcomes among marginalized populations.

Concerted initiatives to improve sanitation, promote better nutrition, and safeguard environmental quality in disadvantaged communities represent critical complementary measures. So too are efforts to empower women and girls through initiatives enhancing educational opportunities and economic autonomy. Data shows drastic reductions in fertility rates and improved maternal/child health outcomes when women gain greater control over reproductive choices.

Fundamentally restructuring the global pharmaceutical industry's drug development priorities and pricing mechanisms presents another key challenge. For-profit models invariably neglect unprofitable disease profiles impacting the world's poor, from tropical diseases to developing cost-effective treatments tailored to resource-limited settings. Massively enhanced public funding for R&D, incentivizing drug re-purposing and distribution networks reaching the last mile represent important components of a more equitable pharmaceutical paradigm.  

Collectively surmounting these immense structural barriers necessitates a dramatic reconceptualization of global health governance and accountability frameworks. Empowering developing nations through increased representation in agenda-setting bodies like the World Health Organization represents a crucial first step. So too is transitioning from an outdated, paternalistic aid-based model to one grounded in multi-stakeholder partnerships where recipient countries play a co-equal decision-making role.

Enhancing civil society's influence in health policy formulation also holds transformative potential. Tragically, the communities facing the world's most acute healthcare deficits frequently lack a voice in how priorities are established and resources allocated. This democratic disenfranchisement perpetuates the cycle of disadvantage and disempowerment. Grassroots social movements championing health rights and accountability for local populations must be cultivated.

Ultimately, the struggle to achieve SDG 3 is inextricably intertwined with the broader quest for global equity and human dignity. Ensuring healthy lives requires not just medical intervention, but dismantling the insidious political, economic and social forces that systematically deprive far too many human beings of their fundamental rights and liberties. Complacency is unacceptable when nearly 6 million children die annually from preventable causes. Realizing the world we wish to inhabit means health justice for all – an audacious yet imminently achievable goal if our commitment matches our rhetoric.
