The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) recognizes that achieving Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3) – ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages – is a multifaceted and complex undertaking. Our approach to this goal is grounded in a comprehensive understanding of the intricate web of factors that influence health outcomes worldwide.

At the core of our efforts is a firm commitment to strengthening health systems and infrastructure. We acknowledge that robust and resilient health systems are the bedrock upon which sustainable progress in health can be built. Through strategic partnerships and targeted investments, we aim to bolster the capacity of healthcare facilities, enhance supply chain management, and facilitate the training and retention of skilled healthcare professionals across the globe.

Furthermore, we prioritize addressing the social determinants of health, recognizing that factors such as poverty, education, gender inequality, and access to clean water and sanitation play a crucial role in shaping health outcomes. Our interventions encompass initiatives that foster economic empowerment, promote educational attainment, and advocate for gender equity, as these are inextricably linked to improved health and well-being.

Maternal and child health remains a cornerstone of our efforts, as we strive to reduce preventable maternal and child mortality rates. Our programs emphasize the provision of quality pre- and postnatal care, skilled birth attendance, and access to essential vaccinations and nutritional support. Additionally, we prioritize addressing reproductive health challenges, including family planning services and combating sexually transmitted infections.

Recognizing the growing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), we have intensified our efforts to tackle this emerging threat. Our strategies encompass promoting healthy lifestyles, addressing risk factors such as tobacco use and unhealthy diets, and enhancing access to early detection and treatment services for conditions like cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and diabetes.

Pandemic preparedness and response are also critical components of our work, as evidenced by our robust efforts during the COVID-19 crisis. We collaborate with global partners to strengthen surveillance systems, enhance diagnostic capacities, and support the equitable distribution of vaccines and therapeutics. Our goal is to build resilient health systems capable of mitigating the impact of future pandemics and safeguarding global health security.

Underpinning our efforts is a strong commitment to data-driven decision-making and evidence-based interventions. We leverage cutting-edge technologies, such as digital health solutions and geospatial mapping, to enhance data collection, analysis, and dissemination. This data-centric approach enables us to identify gaps, target resources efficiently, and monitor progress towards achieving SDG 3 targets.

Moreover, we recognize the importance of fostering multi-stakeholder collaborations and partnerships. Our programs engage with local communities, civil society organizations, the private sector, and other development partners to ensure a coordinated and inclusive approach to addressing health challenges. By leveraging the unique strengths and resources of diverse stakeholders, we can amplify our impact and drive sustainable change.

In conclusion, USAID's approach to SDG 3 is rooted in a comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between health, social, economic, and environmental factors. Through a multi-pronged strategy that encompasses health system strengthening, addressing social determinants, promoting maternal and child health, combating non-communicable diseases, enhancing pandemic preparedness, leveraging data and technology, and fostering strategic partnerships, we are steadfastly committed to ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all, leaving no one behind.
