The Center for Victims of Torture (CVT) recognizes the inextricable link between achieving Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3) on Good Health and Well-Being and our mission to heal the wounds of torture on individuals, their families, and communities. Torture, a deliberate and systematic act of psychological and physical violence, leaves deep scars that permeate all aspects of an individual's life, including their physical, mental, and social well-being.

CVT's work with survivors of torture highlights the multifaceted challenges in ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for this vulnerable population. Physical injuries sustained during torture, such as broken bones, burn wounds, and traumatic brain injuries, often require long-term medical care and rehabilitation services. However, the psychological effects of torture, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety, can be equally, if not more, debilitating and challenging to treat.

Our holistic approach to healing recognizes that mental health and physical health are inextricably linked, and we strive to provide comprehensive care that addresses both aspects. Our interdisciplinary teams, comprising psychologists, social workers, physical therapists, and medical professionals, work collaboratively to develop individualized treatment plans that address the unique needs of each survivor.

Ensuring access to quality essential health-care services, as outlined in SDG 3.8, is a significant challenge for torture survivors, particularly those who have sought refuge in host countries. Language barriers, cultural differences, and a lack of understanding of the complexities of torture trauma can impede effective communication and trust-building between survivors and health care providers. CVT's work involves training and capacity-building initiatives for local healthcare systems to enhance their understanding of torture trauma and its long-term consequences, fostering a more trauma-informed and culturally sensitive approach to care.

The mental health needs of torture survivors are often overlooked or stigmatized, posing a significant barrier to achieving SDG 3.4, which aims to promote mental health and well-being. CVT's mental health interventions, such as individual and group counseling, utilize evidence-based techniques like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and narrative exposure therapy (NET) to help survivors process their traumatic experiences, manage symptoms, and rebuild their lives.

Furthermore, CVT recognizes the importance of addressing the social determinants of health, as outlined in SDG 3.8, to promote the well-being of torture survivors. Many survivors face significant challenges in accessing essential services, such as housing, employment, and education, due to their trauma, displacement, and social stigma. Our community-based programs aim to empower survivors by providing resources, skills training, and advocacy support to facilitate their successful integration into host communities.

CVT's work also extends to addressing the root causes of torture and promoting accountability for human rights violations, which aligns with the overarching principle of SDG 3 to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. Our advocacy efforts focus on raising awareness about the prevalence and consequences of torture, advocating for policy changes, and supporting international mechanisms for accountability and justice.

In conclusion, achieving SDG 3 on Good Health and Well-Being is inherently tied to addressing the pervasive and long-lasting consequences of torture. CVT's multidisciplinary approach to healing, capacity-building initiatives, and advocacy efforts contribute to this goal by providing comprehensive care, promoting trauma-informed practices, and addressing the social determinants of health for torture survivors. Our work underscores the importance of a holistic and intersectional approach to achieving SDG 3, recognizing that health and well-being are influenced by a complex interplay of physical, psychological, social, and environmental factors.
