Sustainable Development Goal 3, "Good Health and Well-Being," is a crucial objective that aligns seamlessly with HelpAge International's mission of addressing the unique challenges faced by older persons worldwide. As the global population continues to age, it is imperative to prioritize the healthcare needs and overall well-being of this rapidly growing demographic.

One of the most pressing concerns is the disproportionate burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) on older adults. Conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes account for a significant proportion of premature deaths among individuals aged 60 and above. This pattern is particularly pronounced in low- and middle-income countries, where access to preventive care, early detection, and effective management of NCDs remains a formidable challenge.

Addressing the unique healthcare needs of older persons requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses not only medical interventions but also socioeconomic determinants of health. For instance, the prevalence of NCDs is often exacerbated by factors such as poverty, inadequate nutrition, and limited access to clean water and sanitation facilities. Consequently, efforts to improve health outcomes for older adults must be integrated with strategies to enhance their overall living conditions and reduce socioeconomic inequalities.

Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the vulnerability of older individuals to emerging infectious diseases. The pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on this age group, with higher rates of severe illness, hospitalization, and mortality. This experience highlights the urgent need to strengthen healthcare systems and enhance their capacity to respond effectively to such public health emergencies, particularly in protecting high-risk populations.

Mental health is another critical aspect of well-being that often goes overlooked for older persons. The prevalence of conditions such as depression, anxiety, and cognitive impairment tends to increase with age, exacerbated by factors such as social isolation, poverty, and limited access to mental health services. Addressing these issues requires a comprehensive approach that encompasses both clinical interventions and community-based support systems.

It is important to recognize that the challenges faced by older persons are not uniform across all contexts. Intersectional factors such as gender, socioeconomic status, and geographic location can further exacerbate existing disparities in healthcare access and outcomes. For example, older women in rural areas may face greater barriers to accessing essential healthcare services, compounded by cultural norms and gender-based discrimination.

To achieve SDG 3 and ensure healthy lives and well-being for all ages, it is crucial to adopt a life-course approach that recognizes the interconnected nature of health determinants throughout an individual's lifespan. Interventions targeting early childhood development, education, and economic empowerment can have long-lasting impacts on health outcomes later in life.

Ultimately, achieving SDG 3 for older persons requires a concerted effort from all stakeholders, including governments, civil society organizations, healthcare providers, and the private sector. This effort must be underpinned by robust data collection and analysis to inform evidence-based policies and interventions tailored to the specific needs and contexts of diverse older populations.
