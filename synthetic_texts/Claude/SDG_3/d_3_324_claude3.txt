The Indian Agency for Partnership in Development (IAPD) presents this analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3): Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. SDG 3 is a critical component of the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, recognizing that good health is essential to sustainable development and a prerequisite for economic growth and societal prosperity.

India's progress on SDG 3 has been a mixed bag, with significant strides made in some areas and persistent challenges in others. The country has achieved remarkable success in reducing maternal mortality ratio (MMR) and under-five mortality rate (U5MR), thanks to initiatives like the National Rural Health Mission (now Ayushman Bharat) and the Mission Indradhanush immunization program. However, India continues to grapple with the triple burden of communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and emerging challenges like antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and climate change-related health risks.

The COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed the vulnerabilities of India's health system, with acute shortages of healthcare workers, hospital beds, and medical supplies. Despite these challenges, India's response to the pandemic has been commendable, with the world's largest vaccination drive and the development of indigenous vaccines like Covaxin and ZyCoV-D. The pandemic has also accelerated the adoption of digital health technologies, such as telemedicine and e-Sanjeevani, which have the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery in remote and underserved areas.

India's battle against communicable diseases has seen mixed results. While the country has made significant strides in the elimination of diseases like polio, leprosy, and guinea worm disease, the burden of tuberculosis (TB), HIV/AIDS, and vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue remains high. The emergence of drug-resistant strains of TB and the resurgence of vector-borne diseases due to climate change pose significant challenges.

The rising burden of NCDs, such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes, is a major concern for India. These diseases are fueled by a combination of factors, including rapid urbanization, changing lifestyles, and an aging population. India's National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) has been instrumental in raising awareness and promoting early detection and management of NCDs, but its impact has been limited by resource constraints and fragmented implementation.

India's efforts to address AMR have been laudable, with the launch of the National Action Plan on AMR in 2017 and the establishment of the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) as the nodal agency for AMR surveillance. However, the indiscriminate use of antibiotics in healthcare settings and the widespread use of antimicrobials in agriculture and aquaculture remain major challenges.

The impact of climate change on health is an emerging concern for India, with the country being particularly vulnerable to heat-related illnesses, vector-borne diseases, and waterborne diseases. The National Action Plan on Climate Change and Human Health (NAPCCHH) has been developed to address these challenges, but its implementation has been hindered by resource constraints and lack of coordination among various stakeholders.

In conclusion, India's progress on SDG 3 has been a mixed bag, with significant achievements alongside persistent challenges. The country's efforts to address these challenges must be multi-pronged, focusing on strengthening primary healthcare, improving access to essential medicines and vaccines, promoting healthy lifestyles, and addressing social determinants of health. Effective implementation of existing policies and programs, coupled with increased investment in healthcare infrastructure and human resources, will be crucial to achieving SDG 3 in India.
