Here is a draft academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-Being), written from the perspective of the late economist Walter E. Williams:

The World's Ill-Conceived Crusade for "Good Health and Well-Being"

Among the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals is the lofty aspiration of ensuring "good health and well-being" for all by 2030. On the surface, this aim seems unassailably virtuous—what decent person could oppose promoting health and well-being globally? Yet delving deeper, SDG 3 reeks of misguided intentions underpinned by collectivist ideology masquerading as humanitarianism.

At its core, this agenda betrays a fundamental misunderstanding about the drivers of improved health outcomes. Its architects naively assume that topdown mandates, activist campaigns, and expenditures of limited resources can manufacture "well-being" through bureaucratic fiat. Thisjedecree mentality ignores the indispensable role of economic liberties, price systems, and personal choice in elevating public health over time.

History has clearly demonstrated that the greatest strides in human longevity and quality of life arose not from herculean government programs, but from the gradual enrichment enabled by free market capitalism. As economic freedom expanded and standards of living improved, mortality rates plunged. Innovations in sanitation, refrigeration, nutrition, housing, and medical technology—all private sector developments—eradicated scourges like cholera while mitigating others.

The putative goal of "achieving universal health coverage" by 2030 illustrates the UN's magical thinking. Guaranteeing expensive medical services to every human on Earth through coercive wealth transfers is neither feasible nor moral. It amounts to a global subsidy that disincentivizes cost containment and personal responsibility while failing to address root causes of poor health like poverty.  

Likewise, SDG 3's call to subsidize healthcare in developing countries is a recipe for bloating third-world bureaucracies and rapacious regimes while creating dependence, not self-sufficiency. The history of international aid is replete with cautionary tales of well-intentioned programs degenerating into corporate welfare and replicating a perpetual beggar state.

Rather than doubling down on statist groupthink, the path to alleviating illness and distress lies in economic freedom, property rights, and free trade—the very policies too often opposed by "world bodies" unaccountable to citizens. Only by enabling people to keep the fruits of their labor can innovation, capital formation, and rising prosperity organically enhance public health.

While the SDG 3 agenda enshrines some laudable objectives like combating epidemics and reducing substance abuse, its premises are irredeemably flawed. Lasting progress requires incentives for ingenuity and wealth creation, unfettered competition, and personal empowerment—not bureaucratic hubris about ordained outcomes. Mankind's health was scarcely improved through centuries of monarchical decrees but advanced exponentially from ascendant economic liberty. Our "sustainable" future depends on learning that vital lesson.
