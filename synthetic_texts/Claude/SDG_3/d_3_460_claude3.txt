Here is a draft newspaper article about Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) as if written by Kiplinger's Personal Finance:

A Healthy Life is True Wealth: Investing in SDG 3 for Personal and Financial Prosperity

For savvy investors looking to diversify their portfolios while making a positive impact, SDG 3 is a compelling opportunity that aligns personal well-being with financial growth potential. SDG 3 - Good Health and Well-Being - is one of the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals aimed at creating a more equitable and prosperous world by 2030.

At its core, SDG 3 recognizes that good health is a fundamental enabler of human capital development, economic progress, and overall quality of life. Healthy individuals are productive workers, engaged students, and active consumers - fueling economic growth. Conversely, the costs of poor health reverberate through healthcare systems, workplaces, and household budgets.

The investment implications are significant. Achieving SDG 3 requires catalyzing innovation across healthcare, life sciences, nutrition, sanitation, and preventive wellness. This unlocks business opportunities for pioneering companies providing affordable medicines, digital health solutions, sustainable food systems, and clean water/hygiene technologies.

Invest in Healthcare Disruption
The COVID-19 pandemic exposed cracks in global health systems while accelerating telehealth, remote patient monitoring, and vaccine development. Smart money is flowing into biotechnology, genomics, regenerative medicine, and disease prevention platforms promising more cost-effective, personalized care. Innovative R&D pipelines in infectious diseases, chronic illnesses, and rare conditions signal potential blockbuster therapies.

Furthermore, aging populations in developed markets are driving demand for novel treatments combating cancer, Alzheimer's, and age-related ailments. Savvy investors are also eyeing emerging markets where rising incomes catalyze healthcare spending.  Mutual funds and ETFs specializing in pharma/biotech provide diversified exposure.

Profit from Preventive Wellness 
The old adage rings true: an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. SDG 3 emphasizes holistic approaches to promoting wellness through balanced diets, physical activity, and environmental stewardship. This translates into opportunities across nutrition, fitness, and sustainability. Companies pioneering plant-based meat alternatives, smart nutrition technologies, and eco-friendly athletic apparel are capturing health-conscious consumer wallets.

Even traditionally boring sectors are being reinvigorated by SDG 3. Ingredient suppliers developing nutrient-dense plant proteins, smart packaging that extends freshness, and ag-tech platforms optimizing crop yields are capitalizing on the push for sustainable nutrition security. From farm to fork, scrutinize your portfolio for tangible connections to SDG 3.

Sanitation Infrastructure Unlocks Productivity
An often-overlooked aspect of SDG 3 is the impact of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services on community health and economic productivity. Globally, billions lack access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation facilities - breeding grounds for disease that disproportionately afflict women and children. Beyond human costs, poor sanitation depresses workforce participation and student attendance, hampering GDP growth.

Investments channeled into municipal water/wastewater treatment plants, low-cost household sanitation solutions, and hygiene education programs can yield outsized development impacts. This creates avenues for public-private partnerships, social impact bonds, and infrastructure funds to capitalize on WASH innovations aligned with SDG 3.

At its essence, promoting good health enhances human potential and purchasing power - the bedrock of lasting economic value creation. As Kiplinger's ethos centers on building wealth through intelligent investment guidance, SDG 3 deserves serious consideration from readers charting financially secure and purposeful paths forward.
