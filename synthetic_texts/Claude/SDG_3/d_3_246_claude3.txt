Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) from the perspective of Raghuram G. Rajan:

The question of how to attain good health and well-being for all is one that vexes policymakers across the world. As an economist, I approach this multidimensional issue through the lens of incentive structures and resource allocations. Fundamentally, we must properly incentivize investments into preventative healthcare policies and innovative medical research while judiciously allocating limited resources. This requires re-examining legacy institutional frameworks.

Let us first consider the incentives surrounding the pharmaceutical industry's R&D priorities. For-profit drug companies, beholden to shareholders, disproportionately focus on developing lucrative treatments for wealthy populations' chronic diseases rather than cost-effective medicines and vaccines for pandemics and neglected tropical diseases disproportionately impacting the global poor. Perverse incentives perpetuate this market failure. We must decouple research priorities from profit motivations through a globally coordinated pivot toward public-private R&D partnerships, advance purchase commitments, patent pools, and prize funds for prioritized health technologies. Such de-risking mechanisms realign incentives.  

Resource allocation poses further challenges. The path dependency of legacy budgeting conventions creates distortions, underinvesting in cost-effective population-level primary healthcare relative to curative interventions. Economic assessments demonstrate the remarkable preventative bang-for-buck from basic public health policies like sanitation infrastructure, nutrition assistance, and frontline health workers. Yet cash-strapped governments in the developing world struggle to direct resources away from politically louder hospital interests. Institutionalizing program budgeting, which quantifies policy impacts, into annual fiscal processes would counterbalance these entrenched interests.

Furthermore, out-of-pocket costs deter many from accessing essential healthcare services, imperilingly household finances - a poverty trap. Transitioning to public insurance coverage and strategic copayment exemptions mitigates this financial barrier. However, policymakers must adopt comprehensive frameworks rather than siloed interventions. Healthcare systems' performance depends on interdependent investments spanning public health, medical education, healthcare finance, pharmaceutical regulation, and health data infrastructure. Developing integrated national health plans incentivized by multilateral development assistance offers a promising path forward.

The conceptual intricacies of implementing universal healthcare coverage have long been scrutinized. However, the existential risk of prospective pandemics caused by zoonotic pathogens - an eventuality rather than a mere possibility - renders addressing systemic health vulnerabilities an urgent economic priority. Our deeply interconnected world makes rapidly mobilizing coordinated global responses imperative for mitigating catastrophic cross-border ripple effects of local health shocks. A well-functioning global health architecture requires genuine multilateral cooperation, not blustery unilateralism. Leadership in shaping norms and building multilateral capacity ensures shared prosperity rather than nationalistic posturing.

Critically, policymakers should view investments into healthcare systems as immensely productive economic development spending rather than narrow social welfare spending. A virulent pathogen does not discern between lucrative and impoverished populations - a breakdown in healthcare capacity anywhere risks destabilizing the global economy. Quantifying these systemic spillover risks through judicious economic modeling highlights the economic imperative of fortifying healthcare systems as critical infrastructure akin to climate resiliency or cybersecurity preparedness. Such an enlightened economic framework counteracts the unfortunate ideological prejudice of dismissing healthcare provision as a philosophical wedge issue.  

In an era of increasing frequency of pandemics and chronic disease burdens straining public finances, fortifying healthcare systems is vital both for human development and economic resilience. Realigning incentives and rationalizing resource allocations offers a pragmatic, evidence-driven policy framework. Achieving the formidable goal of affordable, quality healthcare necessitates not merely technical reforms but philosophical rethinking to transcend institutional inertia and ideological constraints. Economic stewardship demands embracing healthcare provision as a vital public good imperative for sustainable, inclusive development in an interdependent world.
