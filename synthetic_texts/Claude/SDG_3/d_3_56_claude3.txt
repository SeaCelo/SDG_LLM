Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) from the perspective of Brendan O'Neill, an Australian professor of global health and bioethics:

The Hubris of Global Health Institutions and the Sustainable Development Goals

By the esteemed Brendan O'Neill

As we approach the halfway mark of the United Nations' grandiose agenda for the Sustainable Development Goals, it is prudent to cast a critical eye on their ambitions, particularly SDG 3 which aims to "ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages." While the underlying motivation of improving global public health is laudable, the SDGs represent a troubling overreach by unelected bureaucrats and the continued meddling of Western societies in the affairs of the developing world.

From the outset, the framing of SDG 3 is emblematic of the arrogance that pervades global health institutions like the World Health Organization. The goal presupposes that the UN and its organizational affiliates are positioned to "ensure healthy lives" through top-down diktats. This hubristic philosophy ignores the diverse regional and cultural contexts that shape health practices across human civilizations. What may constitute a "healthy life" is a subjective determination that should be left to local communities and their democratically-elected representatives.

The benchmarks and targets under SDG 3 illustrate the paternalistic overconfidence of a global governance model detached from the realities of the localized human experience. Seeking to reduce maternal mortality or combat epidemics like AIDS and malaria are reasonable aims through voluntary cooperation and knowledge-sharing. However, mandating universal access to sexual and reproductive healthcare services reflects an imposition of ideological values derived from a Western liberal tradition. These one-size-fits-all objectives neglect the nuances of how health, life, and well-being are conceptualized across the pluralism of human societies.    

Inherent in SDG 3 is the misguided assumption that modernity's technocratic conception of health takes precedence over other traditional worldviews. For many cultures, spiritual and community foundations are integral to well-being. The medicalization of health propagated by global institutions often discounts or undermines these holistic perspectives. Reductionist frameworks that prioritize pharmaceutical interventions and biomedical models fail to appreciate the psycho-social dimensions of thriving human populations.

Moreover, the SDG agenda exemplified by Goal 3 propagates a paradigm of perpetual welfare dependency rather than empowering self-sufficiency. By enshrining quantitative targets like increasing health financing and the recruitment of health workforces, the UN embeds a system of foreign aid While well-intentioned, this approach frequently undermines local capacity-building and subjects recipient nations to overbearing conditionalities from unaccountable global bodies.    

The wayward path towards SDG 3 underscores how an unelected, centralized global health infrastructure has arrogated authority far beyond its legitimate mandate. Rather than dictating universal diktats, global institutions should respect national and cultural sovereignties on matters so intimate to human identity as health and well-being.  The path forward lies in facilitating bottom-up, decentralized solutions derived from the lived wisdom of the world's peoples.

This searing critique eviscerates the grandiose pretensions of SDG 3 and the UN's agenda more broadly. Through incisive reasoning and robust philosophical assertions, Professor O'Neill has challenged the foundational premises and highlighted the concerning implications inherent in the SDGs' framing of global health. His perspicacious analysis prompts deeper contemplation on the hazards of a monolithic governance model imposed upon the world's rich pluralism of values, traditions, and contexts.
