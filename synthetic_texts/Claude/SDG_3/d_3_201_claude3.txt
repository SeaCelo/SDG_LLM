Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being), written from the perspective of conservative columnist Cal Thomas:

The Sustainable Development Goal of promoting good health and well-being (SDG 3) is a noble ambition with which few would argue on its surface. However, we must examine the assumptions and implications behind this agenda with sobriety and realism.

The fundamental premise seems to be that universal health coverage and access to quality medical services should be a basic human right, to be mandated and micromanaged by governments and international organizations. This philosophy runs counter to American principles of limited government and personal responsibility rooted in our Judeo-Christian heritage.

Scripture teaches that our bodies are "temples of the Holy Spirit" and that we have a moral duty to be good stewards of what God has given us. However, it also recognizes human fallibility and the potential for poor choices that can impact our health. The proposed SDG solutions appear to absolve individuals of accountability for lifestyle decisions like diet, exercise, substance abuse, and risky behaviors that contribute to health issues.

Furthermore, history has shown that top-down governmental health programs tend to diminish quality, ration care, deprive people of choice, and bloat bureaucracies that enrich privileged elites at the expense of the taxpayer. The SDGs seek to universalize such a regime globally under the egalitarian banner of "leaving no one behind." But the reality is that it would leave most people farther behind, stifled by inefficiency, wait times, and lack of innovation.

The proponents seem to operate on the premise that more spending equals better health outcomes. However, the United States spends far more per capita on healthcare than other OECD nations, while ranking lower on metrics like life expectancy and infant mortality. Clearly, it's not just about dollars invested, but how those resources are allocated and incentivized.

American ingenuity and our accelerated COVID-19 vaccine development have demonstrated the power of competitive free markets to drive medical breakthroughs. A centralized, one-size-fits-all SDG model run by unelected bureaucrats could slow or halt such progress by suppressing the profit motive and bourgeoning regulations.

The SDG agenda also seeks to promote "universal access" to family planning and sexual/reproductive services - code for abortion rights. This ethical minefield of ending life in the name of "health for all" represents an unconscionable overreach of standardizing policies that should respect national sovereignty and religious/moral principles.

The goals rightly acknowledge the need to address substance abuse, mental health issues, and environmental impacts like pollution that affect public health. However, the proposed remedies seem rooted more in behavioral economics and "nudge" theories of government social engineering versus empowering human choice, personal virtue, and community reform.

In summary, while the SDG 3 objectives are framed with righteous overtones of promoting human flourishing, the path to achieving them appears littered with hazards that could make the cure worse than the disease in many ways. We should thoughtfully consider to what extent the proposed global health solutions align with American principles of limited government, personal accountability, protection of life, and dynamic free market incentives before ceding sovereignty to centralized planners.

As Ronald Reagan warned, "We must reject the idea that every time a law's passed, it must be nationwide...It's time to check and reverse the growth of government which shows signs of having grown beyond the consent of the governed." The same caution applies to ceding U.S. autonomy and embedding ourselves in potentially naive SDG regimes. Our focus should be on cultivating a spiritual and cultural renewal that equips people to make wise health decisions as moral agents - not doubling down as wards of a secularized global parent state.
