Here is a draft academic article on SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) as if written by conservative commentator Cal Thomas:

The Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the United Nations in 2015 include the laudable goal of ensuring "healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages." As a conservative who believes in limited government and personal responsibility, I have some thoughts on how this goal can best be achieved.

The role of government should be to establish and maintain a basic social safety net to protect the most vulnerable - the severely disabled, the very poor, orphaned children, etc. For everyone else, good health and well-being should be pursued through individual effort, personal choices, self-discipline, and involvement of private institutions and civil society organizations.

Too often, big government programs create dependency, stifle initiative, and distort the functioning of the free market. Obamacare's burdensome regulations and mandates made healthcare more expensive and reduced choice for consumers. Instead of government bureaucracies dictating healthcare policies, we should have a vibrant free market system where people can select insurance plans and providers that meet their specific needs. Price transparency and real consumer choice will drive down costs through competition.

Personal responsibility is also key. Much of the disease burden today is lifestyle-related and preventable through discipline and wise choices about diet, exercise, substance use, and other behaviors. Government campaigns to promote healthy habits are fine, but should not become overreaching or preachy "nanny state" policies that take away individual freedom.

Churches, community groups, and volunteer organizations have an important role in promoting health through education, screening programs, assistance to the needy, and providing human services. These private efforts reflecting America's civic tradition and Judeo-Christian heritage are often more effective and ethical than inflexible government programs.

The profit motive has been an incredible engine for medical advances - from new drugs to high-tech treatments. Excessive taxation and regulation will dampen innovation in areas like gene therapies and regenerative medicine that could revolutionize disease treatment and extend longevity. We need protection of intellectual property rights and technology transfer to get new life-saving and life-enhancing therapies to market faster.

The United States continues to be a world leader in healthcare and a beacon of health innovation. But our approach should be promoting more individual empowerment, free markets, and space for civil society - not an ever-expanding government bureaucracy imposing one-size-fits-all solutions. With personal responsibility, entrepreneurship, and a nurturing of our nation's spirit of invention and compassion, we can achieve true sustainable well-being for all.
