Here is a draft academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) from the perspective of economist John Van Reenen:

Introduction
The inextricable link between health and economic outcomes is one of the most well-established tenets in the field of development economics. A population's health status is not only a critical determinant of their quality of life, but also a foundational driver of productivity, human capital accumulation, and long-term economic growth. The bidirectional nature of this relationship means that investments in health generate significant economic returns, while conversely, economic progress opens pathways to better health provision and outcomes.  

At the heart of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) lies SDG 3 – "Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages." This expansive objective encapsulates the multidimensional challenges faced by countries across the development spectrum in safeguarding the health of their citizens. From reducing preventable maternal and child mortality to combating communicable and non-communicable diseases, and ensuring universal access to quality, affordable healthcare, the scope of SDG 3 is both ambitious and imperative.

Economic Costs of Health Deficiencies
The economic toll exacted by health deficiencies is staggering. The World Health Organization estimates that low-income countries bear an annual output loss of around 6% of their GDP due to malaria alone. Scaled globally, the cumulative losses ascribed to malnutrition amount to a staggering $3.5 trillion per year in forgone productivity and healthcare expenditures. Non-communicable diseases like cardiovascular conditions, cancer, and diabetes, typically associated with more affluent nations, are now rising precipitously in developing countries, straining healthcare resources and sapping economic vitality.

Furthermore, health shocks can trigger catastrophic out-of-pocket expenses that thrust families into poverty traps, perpetuating intergenerational cycles of deprivation. Ill health not only diminishes a household's current income, but also erodes its future income-generating capacity by curtailing educational attainment and human capital investment in children.

Returns on Health Investments  
Conversely, robust empirical evidence underscores the manifold economic benefits accruing from investments in health. Every $1 invested in scaling up modern contraceptive services in developing regions yields a $120 increase in potential revenue. Similarly, every $1 spent on modern childhood immunization generates a $44 economic return. Initiatives aimed at curtailing malnutrition can boost a nation's GDP by up to 11% annually.

At a microeconomic level, health gains translate into higher wages, greater labor market participation, and elevated productivity levels. Healthier children exhibit better cognitive development and educational outcomes, ultimately enhancing their employment prospects and potential lifetime earnings. Moreover, longer life expectancies incentivize higher savings rates and long-term investments, catalyzing economic growth.

Health Systems Strengthening
Achieving SDG 3 hinges crucially on concerted efforts to bolster health systems across the developing world. This entails a multipronged approach: expanding physical healthcare infrastructure, augmenting human resources for health through robust training and retention policies, ensuring reliable access to essential medicines and medical technologies, and instituting robust health financing mechanisms to attain universal health coverage (UHC).

Evidence from countries like Thailand, Mexico, and Rwanda illustrates how strategic investments in strengthening health systems can yield transformative gains in health outcomes while remaining fiscally sustainable. Thailand's Universal Coverage Scheme, instituted in 2001, dramatically expanded access to healthcare for its citizens, with yearly costs amounting to just 4% of GDP – a modest price for extraordinary health dividends.

Multisectoral Synergies
Ultimately, attaining SDG 3 necessitates a coordinated, multisectoral approach that harnesses synergies across the entire SDG agenda. Enhancing access to safe water and sanitation (SDG 6), for instance, is inextricably linked to mitigating communicable diseases. Promoting quality education (SDG 4), especially for girls, has a cascade effect on improving reproductive health indicators and child mortality rates.

Combating climate change (SDG 13) and promoting sustainable consumption patterns (SDG 12) are pivotal to curtailing environmental pollutants that fuel respiratory illnesses, cancer, and other afflictions. Simultaneously, SDG 17's call for revitalizing global partnerships is vital for mobilizing development assistance, facilitating technology transfers, and fostering research collaborations to tackle intractable health challenges.

Conclusion
As the COVID-19 pandemic has poignantly underscored, our globalized world's fortunes are inextricably intertwined when it comes to health crises. Achieving SDG 3 is not merely an ethical imperative; it is an existential economic necessity whose dividends reverberate across all facets of sustainable development. By galvanizing concerted action and commensurate investments, we can forge a world where good health and well-being are not privileges, but universal rights – keystones of human flourishing and shared economic prosperity.
