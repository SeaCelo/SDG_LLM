Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) from the perspective of conservative columnist George Will:

The audacious ambition of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals is both admirable and lamentable. Admirable in its aspiration to uplift all humanity through a comprehensive agenda for societal advancement. Yet lamentable in the towering arrogance and utopian ambition that imbues such a quixotic quest. Of the 17 Goals, perhaps none is more imperative yet more intrinsically problematic than SDG 3 - to "ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages." This is an arena where even the greatest scientific and economic progress has been maddeningly insufficient to fulfill for much of the world's population.  

The conception of "good health and well-being" is a sliding scale, ever-expanding as newfound afflictions emerge and previous benchmarks of wellness are transcended. What constitutes sufficient healthcare provision is an amorphous, subjective, and eternally unattainable ideal. The insatiable hunger to combat all suffering and extend life infinitely is the perpetual curse of contemporary medicine. Each scourge eradicated, each new therapy pioneered, spawns greater ambition and expectation.  

Developing nations rightly clamor for the advanced pharmaceuticals, preventative care regimens, and healthcare infrastructure of the West. And yet, that very pinnacle is perpetually obsolesced even in the most lavishly funded systems. The paradox of the modern Hippocratic oath is the implicit promise to infinitely prolong life, rendering any static goal of "good health" instantly outdated the moment it is defined.

The grand folly of SDG 3 is its governmental conceptualization of healthcare as a collectivized "public good" to be centrally provided. It is an individuality-effacing fantasy that a utilitarian calculation of sufficient care can be mass-produced and equitably "ensured" across 8 billion people. In reality, healthcare is an infinitely personal experience – defined by subjective assessments of quality, on-demand accessibility, and responsiveness to each patient's specific circumstances. 

A more illuminating global metric would be the degree of individual autonomy and economic liberty that empowers people to prioritize and pursue their own healthcare needs as they define them. Rather than fixating on equalizing statistical outputs, development strategies should prioritize policies that maximize personal and economic freedoms. People flourish when they can exercise their preferences for healthcare consumption uninhibited – from preventative wellness to curative intervention.

This inevitably yields uneven distributions as an organic expression of differentiated valuations, financial resources, and lifestyle choices. But far preferable to subjugating the individual to a common, institutionalized regimen of one-size-fits-all care in a utopian quest for absolute parity. For it is that very diversity and decentralized muddling that catalyzes the intellectual competition and entrepreneurial risk-taking to perpetually elevate the quality of care worldwide.

As usual with such UN zeal for central planning, SDG 3 is suffused with embedded contradictions and myopic oversimplifications. It presumes an internationally harmonized corpus of "best practices" can be objectively defined and governmentally administered. This institutionalizes a lowest-common-denominator approach – empowering unaccountable bureaucrats to determine what is "reasonable" and leaving no pathway for experimentation beyond established protocols.  

Ultimately, SDG 3 is a Procrustean conception – a mismeasure that willfully averts its gaze from the infinitude of subjective priorities and preferences that configure authentic human flourishing. Our feeble, biologically-constrained existences render any conception of universal "Good Health and Well-Being for all" an unwitting misnomer and seductive falsehood. A more modest conception focused on maximizing individual autonomy to make authentic healthcare choices may not have the inspirational jauntiness of the UN's slogan. But it is a more liberating, sustainable, and clear-eyed foundation for elevating the genuine welfare of people worldwide.
