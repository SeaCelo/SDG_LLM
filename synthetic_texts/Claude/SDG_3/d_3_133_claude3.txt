Good health and well-being for all is a noble and ambitious goal, yet one that remains elusive for far too many people around the world. As a journalist covering global health and development issues for over two decades, I have witnessed firsthand the staggering inequalities and systemic challenges that continue to impede progress on this front.

The third Sustainable Development Goal, which aims to "ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages," is a rallying cry for a comprehensive approach to addressing the multifaceted determinants of health. It underscores the inextricable link between health, poverty, education, gender equality, and environmental sustainability – a recognition that has long been lacking in traditional siloed approaches.

At the heart of this goal lies a fundamental human right: the right to access quality, affordable healthcare services without falling into poverty. Yet, for millions of people, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, this remains an elusive dream. Insufficient investment in healthcare infrastructure, shortages of trained medical personnel, and prohibitive out-of-pocket expenses continue to impose significant barriers to accessing even basic medical care.

But health is about much more than just healthcare. It is inextricably linked to the social, economic, and environmental conditions in which people live, work, and age. The SDG 3 targets, therefore, rightly encompass a broad range of interconnected issues, from reducing maternal and child mortality to combating communicable and non-communicable diseases, promoting mental health and well-being, achieving universal health coverage, and addressing the health risks posed by environmental degradation and climate change.

One of the most pressing challenges in this regard is the growing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory illnesses. Once considered "diseases of affluence," NCDs now disproportionately affect low- and middle-income countries, where they account for nearly three-quarters of global deaths. Tackling this epidemic requires a multi-pronged approach that addresses not only the availability and affordability of treatment but also the underlying social determinants of health, such as unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, and exposure to environmental risk factors.

Another critical area of focus is the health of vulnerable populations, including women, children, and marginalized communities. Despite significant progress in reducing maternal and child mortality rates over the past two decades, stark disparities persist both within and between countries. Barriers to access, cultural norms, and gender-based discrimination continue to undermine efforts to ensure comprehensive reproductive, maternal, and child health services for all.

The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the existential threat posed by emerging infectious diseases and the fragility of global health systems. The disproportionate impact of the pandemic on marginalized communities and the widening of health inequalities have underscored the urgency of building resilient, equitable, and well-resourced healthcare systems capable of responding to future health emergencies.

Achieving SDG 3 will require a concerted global effort, one that recognizes the inextricable links between health, poverty, education, gender equality, and environmental sustainability. It will necessitate increased investment in healthcare infrastructure, healthcare workforce development, and universal health coverage schemes that protect individuals from catastrophic out-of-pocket expenses.

But it will also require addressing the broader social, economic, and environmental determinants of health through intersectoral collaboration and policy coherence. This means prioritizing access to safe water and sanitation, promoting healthy diets and physical activity, improving air quality and addressing climate change, and fostering inclusive, equitable societies that respect human rights and promote gender equality.

Ultimately, the path to achieving SDG 3 is one that recognizes the inherent dignity and worth of every human life, regardless of socioeconomic status, gender, race, or geographic location. It is a path that demands a fundamental shift in how we view and prioritize health – not merely as a byproduct of development, but as a fundamental human right and a prerequisite for sustainable, inclusive growth.

As I have witnessed time and again in my travels, the pursuit of good health and well-being is intrinsically tied to the pursuit of justice, equity, and human dignity. It is a journey that requires not only scientific advancements and increased resources but also a deep commitment to addressing the root causes of ill health and dismantling the systemic barriers that perpetuate inequalities.

Only by embracing this holistic, rights-based approach can we truly achieve the transformative vision of SDG 3 and create a world where every person, regardless of their circumstances, has the opportunity to lead a healthy, fulfilling life.
