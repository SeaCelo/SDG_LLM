Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) from the perspective of Margaret Wente:

The Sustainable Development Goals are an ambitious set of targets adopted by the United Nations, with the lofty aim of transforming our world by 2030. One of the most critically important of these goals is SDG 3 - ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all, at all ages. On the surface, this seems like an uncontroversial and laudable objective that no rational person could disagree with. Who wouldn't want longer, healthier lives for themselves and their fellow human beings? The devil, as always, is in the details.

Let's start with the global health landscape as it exists today. Despite tremendous medical and scientific advancements over the past century, health inequalities between and within countries remain stark. According to the World Health Organization, the life expectancy gap between low-income and high-income countries is a staggering 18.1 years for men and 19.7 years for women. Preventable diseases like malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS continue to disproportionately affect impoverished regions, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Maternal mortality rates in conflict zones and remote rural areas are unacceptably high. In short, while modern medicine has given us extraordinary capabilities, we have failed to equitably distribute these life-saving and life-extending resources on a global scale.

The ambitious targets under SDG 3 seek to rectify these deep inequalities by the ambitious (and perhaps unrealistic) deadline of 2030. Some key targets include reducing the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births, ending preventable deaths of newborns and under-5 children, ending the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases, and achieving universal health coverage with access to safe, affordable, and effective medicines and vaccines for all. Many of these seem like common sense, humane objectives that we should have achieved decades ago. Yet the sobering reality is that even after adopting these goals in 2015, progress has been uneven at best.

One does not need to be a heartless cynic to be skeptical about the feasibility of achieving SDG 3 within the next 8 years. Unprecedented financial investments, innovative delivery mechanisms for medicines and health services, effective strategies for overcoming misinformation and distrust, and a true commitment to global cooperation and solidarity would all be required - and these pieces largely remain elusive. Wealthy nations have hardly been generous in supporting this goal, with overseas development assistance for health actually declining in recent years. Outbreaks like Ebola and COVID-19 have exposed how fragile health systems remain, even in developed economies that should know better. Rampant misinformation, particularly during the pandemic, demonstrated that expertise and even overwhelming scientific evidence often struggle to compete with fear, ignorance, and conspiratorial thinking.  

At the same time, we cannot resign ourselves to inaction or complacency in the face of these monumental challenges. Making substantive progress on SDG 3 isn't just about human rights or morality - it's also pragmatic self-interest for an interconnected world where diseases can rapidly cross borders. Nobody is truly safe until everybody is safe. Perhaps 2030 is too ambitious a target, but the tremendous deprivation and suffering caused by lack of access to basic health services should spur wealthy nations to treat this as an urgent priority. Innovative financing models, technological leapfrogging for service delivery, and fostering trust in scientific institutions - these should be front-and-center in the global health agenda.

Ultimately, while I remain cynical about SDG 3 being fully achieved within this decade, the goals themselves are critical guideposts for a more sustainable, equitable trajectory of human development. Even falling short in 2030 is better than indifference or regression. Modern humanity wields incredible power over life and death through our scientific mastery. It's long past time we applied those capabilities and that power more justly to uplift the health and well-being of all people, across all nations. The Sustainable Development Goals may be imperfect and overly ambitious, but at least they remind us that such a moral imperative exists - whether we choose to honor it or not.
