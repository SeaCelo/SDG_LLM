The pursuit of Sustainable Development Goal 3 – ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages – stands as a monumental endeavor, one that demands a multifaceted approach and unwavering commitment from global actors. As the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, we recognize the inextricable link between health, economic prosperity, and sustainable development, making this goal a cornerstone of our international cooperation efforts.

At the heart of our strategy lies a comprehensive understanding of the intricate challenges posed by communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases, maternal and child health, and the broader determinants of health. We actively collaborate with partner nations, multilateral organizations, and civil society to address these multidimensional issues through a range of interventions.

Combating the persistent threat of communicable diseases remains a top priority. Despite significant progress, the global burden of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and neglected tropical diseases continues to undermine socioeconomic development in many regions. Our approach involves strengthening health systems, improving access to essential medicines and vaccines, and fostering community-based interventions that address the social and environmental factors contributing to disease transmission.

Furthermore, we acknowledge the growing prevalence of non-communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes, which now account for a staggering 71% of global deaths. Our efforts focus on promoting healthy lifestyles, addressing risk factors like tobacco use, unhealthy diets, and physical inactivity, and strengthening primary healthcare services for early detection and management of these conditions.

Maternal and child health remains a critical area of concern, as we strive to reduce preventable maternal and child mortality rates and ensure access to quality healthcare services throughout the continuum of care. Our initiatives encompass improving access to skilled birth attendants, increasing coverage of essential interventions like immunization and nutritional support, and addressing underlying social determinants that impact maternal and child health outcomes.

Recognizing the multidimensional nature of health, we also prioritize addressing the broader determinants of health, such as access to safe water and sanitation, adequate nutrition, and environmental factors. Our approach involves intersectoral collaboration, integrating health considerations into policies and programs across various sectors, including agriculture, education, and urban planning.

Moreover, we acknowledge the disproportionate impact of health challenges on vulnerable and marginalized populations, including women, children, indigenous communities, and those living in conflict-affected or resource-constrained settings. Our interventions are tailored to address these inequities, promoting inclusive and equitable access to quality health services and empowering communities to overcome barriers to health and well-being.

Recognizing the complex interplay between health and sustainable development, we actively promote innovative financing mechanisms, such as public-private partnerships and blended finance models, to mobilize resources and catalyze investments in health infrastructure, research, and capacity building. Additionally, we prioritize the integration of digital health solutions, leveraging emerging technologies to improve data collection, disease surveillance, and access to healthcare services, particularly in remote and underserved areas.

As we navigate the path towards achieving SDG 3, we remain steadfast in our commitment to evidence-based policymaking, continuous learning, and adaptive management. We actively engage with academic institutions, research organizations, and global health experts to stay abreast of the latest scientific advancements, best practices, and emerging challenges in the health sector.

Ultimately, our efforts are driven by the profound understanding that investing in health is not merely a moral imperative but a strategic investment in human capital, economic productivity, and sustainable development. By promoting healthy lives and well-being for all, we lay the foundation for resilient societies, prosperous economies, and a sustainable future for generations to come.
