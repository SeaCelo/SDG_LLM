The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) presents this analytical report on the progress and challenges associated with Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3): "Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages." This goal encompasses a comprehensive and ambitious agenda aimed at addressing various critical health issues worldwide, ranging from reducing maternal and child mortality to combating communicable and non-communicable diseases, promoting mental health, and achieving universal health coverage.

Despite substantial progress in advancing global health over the past decades, significant disparities persist across and within countries, exacerbated by socioeconomic inequalities, conflicts, and environmental factors. The COVID-19 pandemic has further underscored the vulnerabilities of health systems and the interconnectedness of health challenges, with profound impacts on economic and social development.

Maternal and Child Health: While the global maternal mortality ratio has declined by approximately 38% since 2000, it remains unacceptably high, with an estimated 295,000 women dying from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth in 2017. Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia account for the majority of these deaths, highlighting the need for continued investment in skilled birth attendants, emergency obstetric care, and addressing underlying socioeconomic determinants. Child mortality rates have also decreased substantially, but progress has been uneven, and an estimated 5.3 million children under the age of 5 died in 2018, primarily from preventable causes such as pneumonia, diarrhea, and malaria.

Communicable Diseases: Despite significant progress in combating HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, these diseases continue to pose significant challenges, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. In 2019, an estimated 38 million people were living with HIV/AIDS, with 1.7 million new infections occurring that year. Tuberculosis remains one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide, with multidrug-resistant strains posing a growing threat. Malaria, while declining, still caused an estimated 409,000 deaths in 2019, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa. Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, Ebola, and Zika, underscore the need for robust surveillance, preparedness, and response mechanisms.

Non-Communicable Diseases: The global burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes, is rapidly increasing, driven by factors such as aging populations, urbanization, and unhealthy lifestyles. NCDs account for over 70% of global deaths, with a disproportionate impact on low- and middle-income countries. Addressing NCDs requires a comprehensive approach encompassing prevention, early detection, and access to affordable treatment and care.

Mental Health and Substance Abuse: Mental health and substance abuse disorders are significant contributors to the global disease burden, yet they remain largely neglected and underfunded. An estimated one in four people worldwide will experience a mental health condition at some point in their lives, with depression and anxiety among the leading causes of disability. Substance abuse, including alcohol and drug use disorders, is a major public health concern, contributing to premature mortality, disease burden, and societal costs.

Universal Health Coverage (UHC): Achieving UHC, which aims to ensure that all individuals and communities have access to quality essential health services without experiencing financial hardship, is a central tenet of SDG 3. However, significant gaps persist, with an estimated half of the world's population lacking access to essential health services in 2017. Barriers to UHC include inadequate health financing, shortages of skilled health workers, and weak health systems, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.

Environmental and Social Determinants of Health: Health is intrinsically linked to various environmental and social determinants, including air pollution, water and sanitation, climate change, and socioeconomic factors such as poverty, education, and gender inequality. Addressing these determinants requires a multisectoral approach and collaboration across various stakeholders, including governments, civil society, and the private sector.

Achieving SDG 3 requires a comprehensive and coordinated global effort, involving sustained political commitment, increased investment in health systems and workforce, and strengthened partnerships and collaboration. Effective implementation strategies must address the underlying social, economic, and environmental determinants of health, promote equity and inclusiveness, and leverage innovative approaches, such as digital health technologies and community-based interventions.

The OECD calls upon its member countries and global partners to prioritize SDG 3 as a catalyst for sustainable development, recognizing the inextricable links between health, economic growth, and overall societal well-being. By collectively addressing the challenges outlined in this report and fostering a shared commitment to health for all, we can pave the way towards a more equitable, resilient, and prosperous global community.
