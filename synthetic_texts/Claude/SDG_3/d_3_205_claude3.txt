Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) from the perspective of Walter E. Williams:

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3) to "ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages" represents an admirable but misguided endeavor that is doomed to fail. The fatal flaw with this initiative is its reliance on the same collectivist and coercive mechanisms that have crippled progress throughout human history. SDG 3 seeks to substitute centralized planning by self-interested political forces for the incredible achievements that emerge from economic freedom, private property rights, and free markets.

Any honest examination of history reveals that it was capitalism and the protection of individual rights, not government edicts, that paved the way for modern society's unprecedented improvements in human health and longevity. Prior to the rise of free market economies, abject poverty was the natural state for the human condition. Access to basic medical care, proper sanitation, and adequate nutrition were unimaginable luxuries for all but a privileged few. Society remained stagnant for millennia under various forms of collectivism that stripped individuals of their rights to their labor and property.

It was the intellectual renaissance of individual liberty that catalyzed the Industrial Revolution and rapidly raised living standards. By the 19th century, market economies had already begun extending lives through mass production of clothing, construction materials, and agricultural technologies that provided resilience against disease and malnutrition. And as capital accumulated, individuals were able to increasingly afford life-saving medical innovations.

Today, people in capitalist nations enjoy quality health care, abundant food, comprehensive modern infrastructures, and individual wealth beyond the comprehension of our ancestors. Meanwhile, those trapped in societies shunning economic freedom continue languishing in insalubrious conditions. SDG 3's central planners arrogantly believe their diktats can supersede the natural incentives of free markets that have consistently proven their unparalleled ability to improve human well-being.

SDG 3's proponents decry the lack of government-controlled "universal health coverage" while ignoring how socialized medicine has perpetually led to substandard care, long wait times, misallocation of resources, and disincentives for innovation. Market-based systems, on the other hand, have given the world virtually all modern medical advances as the profit motive spurs entrepreneurs to relentlessly develop and commercialize new lifesaving treatments and technologies. The same capitalistic drive for self-improvement underlies agriculture's wildly productive advances, even as SDG 3 remains fixated on promoting centralized "sustainable food production systems." History shows these collectivist schemes inevitably breed inefficiency, stagnation, and deprivation.

Similarly flawed is SDG 3's insistence on curtailing tobacco use through heavy taxation and regulation. This is yet another rights-violating effort that substitutes political paternalism for individual freedom of choice. Smokers should be free to decide whether or not to partake in a legal activity, fully weighing the risks and benefits for themselves. Those lamenting smoking's public health costs conveniently disregard the revenues generated from existing "sin" taxes and ignore smokers' reduced Medicare expenses from their lower life expectancy.

While SDG 3 hypocritically seeks to eradicate "preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5," it says nothing about shielding the quintillions of fetuses exterminated annually through the prenatal practice of abortion. Terminating these unborn lives is perhaps the greatest violation of the most fundamental human right – the right to life itself – that any civilization could ever perpetrate.

SDG 3 extols the virtues of "universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services." In practice, this euphemistic jargon translates into promoting morally hazardous behavior while forcibly transferring wealth from the hardworking to subsidize such corrosive lifestyles. This toxic entitlement mentality clashes with the values of self-discipline and personal responsibility so vital to "ensuring healthy lives."

Rather than empowering unaccountable bureaucrats at beleaguered organizations like the United Nations and World Health Organization, the path to better global health and prosperity is to secure economic liberties and private property rights worldwide. Free people in free markets have consistently demonstrated their unrivaled capabilities in eliminating the very societal ills SDG 3 ineffectually aims to solve. But as long as collectivists cling to their discredited ideological dogmas, human progress will remain unnecessarily impeded.
