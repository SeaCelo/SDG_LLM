Save the Children's analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 3: Good Health and Well-Being

The global health landscape has witnessed significant progress in recent decades, yet formidable challenges persist, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Achieving Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3) – ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all, at all ages – is a monumental undertaking that demands a multifaceted, collaborative approach.

Maternal and child health remains a critical concern, with an estimated 295,000 women dying during pregnancy and childbirth in 2017, and 5.3 million children under the age of five perishing from preventable causes. While progress has been made in reducing maternal mortality ratios and under-five mortality rates, the pace of improvement is inadequate to meet the SDG targets. Inadequate access to skilled birth attendants, lack of emergency obstetric care, and high adolescent birth rates exacerbate these challenges.

Malnutrition, a multidimensional issue, continues to impede child development and survival. In 2019, an estimated 144 million children under the age of five were stunted, and 47 million were wasted, reflecting chronic and acute malnutrition, respectively. Micronutrient deficiencies, particularly in iron, vitamin A, and zinc, further compound the problem. Addressing malnutrition requires a comprehensive approach, including improving food security, promoting exclusive breastfeeding, and fortifying staple foods.

Infectious diseases remain a significant burden, particularly in resource-limited settings. HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and neglected tropical diseases continue to claim millions of lives annually, disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable populations. While remarkable progress has been made in combating these diseases, sustained efforts and innovative strategies are crucial to achieving the SDG targets.

Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes, are rapidly increasing, posing a significant threat to global health and development. In 2019, NCDs were responsible for 74% of global deaths, with low- and middle-income countries bearing the brunt of this burden. Addressing NCDs requires a multisectoral approach, focusing on prevention, early detection, and access to affordable treatment.

Environmental factors, including air pollution, unsafe water, and inadequate sanitation, contribute significantly to the global disease burden. In 2019, an estimated 1.7 million deaths were attributed to unsafe water, sanitation, and hygiene. Climate change further exacerbates these challenges, increasing the risk of vector-borne diseases, malnutrition, and respiratory ailments.

Healthcare systems in many countries are woefully underfunded and understaffed, hindering access to essential services and quality care. The global shortage of healthcare workers, particularly in rural and remote areas, remains a critical challenge. Strengthening health systems, improving infrastructure, and enhancing the capacity of healthcare professionals are imperative to achieving SDG 3.

Achieving universal health coverage (UHC) is a cornerstone of SDG 3, ensuring that all individuals have access to essential, affordable healthcare services without facing financial hardship. However, significant disparities persist, with many individuals unable to access or afford the care they need. Addressing these inequities requires concerted efforts to improve healthcare financing, service delivery, and overall health system governance.

Lastly, the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of robust health systems and the urgent need for global solidarity and cooperation. The pandemic has exacerbated existing health inequalities, disrupted essential health services, and exposed vulnerabilities in health systems worldwide. Recovering from the pandemic's impact and building resilient, equitable health systems is paramount to achieving SDG 3 and ensuring preparedness for future health emergencies.

In conclusion, achieving SDG 3 requires a collaborative, multisectoral approach that addresses the social, economic, and environmental determinants of health. Investments in healthcare infrastructure, workforce development, and innovative financing mechanisms are crucial. Partnerships between governments, civil society organizations, the private sector, and communities are essential to driving progress and ensuring that no one is left behind on the path to good health and well-being for all.
