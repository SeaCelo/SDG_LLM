The global pursuit of ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages, as encapsulated in Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3), has witnessed significant strides yet grapples with formidable challenges. Expertise France, a preeminent French agency for international technical assistance, recognizes the multifaceted nature of this endeavor and the imperative to adopt a holistic, equity-driven approach.

Despite substantial progress in reducing maternal and child mortality rates, disparities persist across and within nations, often exacerbated by socioeconomic inequalities, gender norms, and limited access to quality healthcare services. Expertise France's interventions emphasize strengthening health systems, particularly in fragile and conflict-affected contexts, where disruptions to essential services can have devastating consequences. Capacity-building initiatives for healthcare professionals, infrastructure development, and supply chain management are pivotal in ensuring the provision of comprehensive maternal, newborn, and child health services.

The global burden of communicable diseases, while declining, remains a pressing concern, especially in resource-constrained settings. Expertise France's strategies encompass preventive measures, such as immunization campaigns, vector control, and health education, coupled with enhanced surveillance and rapid response mechanisms to mitigate the impact of epidemics and pandemics. Collaborative efforts with local communities, leveraging their knowledge and cultural practices, have proven instrumental in fostering trust and encouraging the adoption of preventive behaviors.

Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes, pose a formidable challenge, accounting for a significant proportion of premature deaths worldwide. Expertise France's multipronged approach targets risk factor reduction through policy interventions, public awareness campaigns, and the promotion of healthy lifestyles. Simultaneously, strengthening primary healthcare systems and enhancing access to affordable diagnostics and treatments are crucial for early detection and effective management of NCDs.

Mental health, long neglected in global health discourse, has gained well-deserved attention, with Expertise France recognizing its profound impact on individual well-being and societal development. The agency's initiatives encompass capacity-building for mental health professionals, integration of mental health services into primary care, and the promotion of psychosocial support programs, particularly in humanitarian crises and post-conflict settings.

The catalytic role of universal health coverage (UHC) in achieving SDG 3 cannot be overstated. Expertise France's efforts are geared towards supporting partner countries in developing sustainable financing mechanisms, strengthening governance and accountability frameworks, and fostering intersectoral collaborations to address the social determinants of health. Innovative approaches, such as community-based health insurance schemes and public-private partnerships, are explored to enhance access to quality, affordable healthcare services.

Expertise France acknowledges the inextricable link between health and environmental sustainability, as reflected in the agency's advocacy for climate-resilient healthcare infrastructure, promotion of sustainable waste management practices, and integration of environmental considerations into health policies and programs.

Collaboration and knowledge-sharing are central to Expertise France's modus operandi, fostering partnerships with local and international stakeholders, including governments, civil society organizations, research institutions, and the private sector. This collaborative approach facilitates the exchange of best practices, fosters innovation, and ensures the contextual relevance and sustainability of interventions.

While progress has been made, the road ahead remains arduous, with emerging challenges such as antimicrobial resistance, the growing burden of non-communicable diseases, and the impacts of climate change on human health. Expertise France remains resolute in its commitment to SDG 3, recognizing the interconnectedness of health with other Sustainable Development Goals and the imperative of a concerted, multi-sectoral effort to achieve the ambitious targets set forth by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
