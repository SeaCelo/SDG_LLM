Here is a detailed academic article discussing SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) from the perspective of Ben Shapiro:

The left's vision for the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 3 on health and well-being is fundamentally flawed. Their big government approach fails to recognize the power of free markets, individual liberty, and traditional values in promoting true health for all.

The facts are clear - the most significant gains in longevity and disease prevention have occurred in free societies that respect private property rights, encourage innovation through capitalist incentives, and maintain strong family units that promote healthy behaviors from a young age. The greatest threats to public health aren't lack of bureaucratic intervention, but moral decay.

Look at the scourge of obesity fueled by over-reliance on dopamine-spiking processed foods devoid of nutritional value. We've strayed from the wisdom of our Judeo-Christian food traditions in favor of cheap hedonism peddled by massive multinational corporations unconcerned with health ramifications. Restoring the nuclear family with a grounding in faith-based discipline around diet would be more effective than any big government sin taxes or nanny-state regulations.   

The same is true for the tsunami of depression, anxiety, and other mental health crises now endemic among our youth. Robbed of meaning by the left's rejection of objective truth and of community by the decline of civil society institutions, our young male population in particular is being sapped of its vitality and purpose. Obsession with affirming transgressive behaviors pushed by the diversity-inclusion-equity cult comes at the cost of basic mental health.   

Even the COVID-19 pandemic, frequently touted by globalist elites as proof of the need for expansive disease control powers, showed the superiority of decentralized, freedom-based policy. States with lighter lockdowns had similar age-adjusted health outcomes as those with draconian restrictions that crushed small businesses and civil liberties. Now the unprecedented mRNA genetic vaccines hastily unveiled under regulatory capture have disturbing safety signals that a truly independent medical industry wouldn'tallow.

For true health assurance, we need a return to first principles - robust protections for individual and economic freedoms, a revival of community self-reliance and traditional virtue, and a rebuff of the secular nihilism and dehumanizing scientism pushed by technocratic elites who put their trust in malevolent utopian schemes like Agenda 2030. Healthy individuals can only emerge from healthy societies rooted in universal, immutable truths like those found in the Judeo-Christian tradition. That worldview honored the sanctity of life and human flourishing long before the UN existed, and will remain true long after their misguided social re-engineering programs have been dismantled and discredited.
