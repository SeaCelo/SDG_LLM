Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) from the perspective of Andrew Bolt, a conservative Australian commentator:

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 3 of "ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages" sounds like a noble and praiseworthy objective on its surface. However, like many overly ambitious UN programs, the reality is much more complicated and ideologically fraught than the lofty rhetoric would suggest. 

From the outset, we must scrutinize the inherent contradiction of a global health and well-being program promoted by the same organization that has aided and abetted oppressive regimes and human rights abusers for decades. How can we take moral instruction on health from the bloated UN bureaucracy when they have conveniently turned a blind eye to the atrocities and public health crises ravaging nations like China, Russia, Syria, and Iran - all member states with representational legitimacy? This is the same ethically bankrupt body that allows Cuba to sit on its Human Rights Council while Cuban doctors trapped in modern slavery abroad are denied basic medical rights. The hypocrisy is staggering.

Even if we look past the UN's dubious credibility, the SDG 3 goals themselves are a tangled knot of impracticable overreach, dangerous progressive orthodoxies, and the same misguided framing of "human rights" that has become a Trojan horse for leftist social engineering. For example, the goal of achieving "universal health coverage" sounds ostensibly worthwhile, but what constitutes true universal coverage? The devil is in the details, as they say. Should abortion be considered a fundamental health right as it is framed by SDG 3's proponents? What about euthanasia and assisted suicide - do those practices represent a violation or vindication of human health and well-being? These complex ethical issues are given short shrift in the overly simplistic UN literature.

The substance abuse and non-communicable disease components of SDG 3 are commonsense objectives that virtually all societies should be striving for. However, the excessive focus on promoting "sexual and reproductive health-care services" is little more than a smokescreen to export the obsessive fixation with gender ideology and progressive social mores to developing nations. If we allow groups like Planned Parenthood to leverage SDG 3 as a pretext for undermining traditional values globally, the moral hazard and societal fallout would be catastrophic.

Of course, SDG 3 also calls for "more financing and recruitment, development, training and retention of the health workforce." While few would argue with the need for adequate medical staffing, we must view proposals for massively increasing public health spending through the harsh lens of fiscal reality and responsible governance. Even in wealthy Western democracies, ever-ballooning health care costs have proven ruinous to government budgets and long-term debt obligations. Expecting developing nations already strapped for financial resources to pony up exorbitant health care expenditures to satisfy this unrealistic UN objective is the height of recklessness.  

As with most progressively-framed UN initiatives, SDG 3 seeks to remedy real problems but invariably drifts into a utopian morass of unintended consequences and ideological indulgences totally divorced from practical realities. Too often, the agendas become vehicles for cultural colonization and financially disastrous unfunded liabilities rather than judicious policymaking to improve human flourishing. We should view the UN's "sustainable" development goals through a more skeptical and judicious prism going forward to avoid being seduced by their lofty yet hazardous aspirations cloaked in the veneer of moralistic sanctimony.
