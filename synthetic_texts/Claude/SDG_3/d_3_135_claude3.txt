Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages), as if written by the British satirist and comedian Mark Steel:

The Unsustainable Quest for Sustainable Health and Wellbeing
By Mark Steel, Distinguished Professor of Comedic Ranting

Let's talk about SDG 3, shall we? It's the one about ensuring "healthy lives and promoting wellbeing for all at all ages." Seems simple enough, right? Just pop down to your local superdrug and pick up a basket full of "healthy lives" and a side order of "wellbeing" on the way out. What could possibly be complicated about that?

But wait, there's more! The goal isn't just to dish out health and happiness like a doting grandmother forcing an extra helping of stodgy pudding. No, we're meant to do it "for all at all ages." That's right, from squally newborns to those centenarians who've seen it all and are just biding their time until the next world war.  

Forgive me for being a stickler for details, but doesn't that sound just a tad ambitious? I mean, I've seen the National Health Service struggle to clear up a nasty bout of norovirus at the village primary, never mind safeguarding the wellbeing of every single human on the planet at every stage of life. It's the perpetual Sisyphean task that keeps slipping from our grasp like a cheap rubber novelty snake.

But who am I to stand athwart the noble ambitions of the United Nations and their merry band of do-gooders? After all, they've simply distilled the core struggle of human existence - the endless, fruitless toil to achieve lasting health, happiness and inherent self-worth - into a single pithy TARGET with some delightfully vague INDICATORS to match.

Take 3.1 for instance: "By 2030, reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births." You'd think getting a grip on something as fundamental as not dying while bringing new life into the world would be a piece of organically-baked cake by now. But apparently not! Though I suppose it gives the ladies something to periodically fret over as the inexorable march towards 2030 gathers pace.  

Then there's 3.3: "By 2030, end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other communicable diseases." Nothing too taxing there, then. Just completely vanquish some of mankind's oldest and most persistent plagues within a strict timescale and finite budget. Why didn't anyone think of this before? We'll just gird the old loins and give illness a jolly good thrashing while we're at it.

My personal favourite has to be 3.6: "By 2020, halve the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents." Let that one sink in for a moment. They're setting themselves the target of reducing the completely unacceptable and unavoidable death toll from road carnage...by only 50 percent. As if the other 50% was just an unfortunate but unavoidable rounding error. I can picture the meeting now: "Well, we simply can't prevent ALL the maiming and killing on the roads or the motorists might think we're getting above ourselves!"  

You've got to admire their chutzpah, I suppose. While the rest of us resign ourselves to muddling through with whatever scraps of fortitude and sanitybwe can muster, the SDG mob have resolved to somehow finagle a state of perpetual health, security and contentment for every man, woman and child on Earth. All within a strict 15-year window and a unified commitment to some relatively undemanding targets and indicators.  

Well, godspeed to them, I say! It's a laudable if laughably unrealistic aim. No doubt future historians will look back on this period as a charming blip of na√Øve idealism before the brutal reality of famine, pandemic and trench warfare returned with a vengeance. In the meantime, we can always rely on satire to mock the futile struggle for sustainability. At least until the marauding hordes turn up at the village gates seeking a sustainable source of hearty jesters to enslave, oppress and eventually liquidate. Ah, the circle of life...
