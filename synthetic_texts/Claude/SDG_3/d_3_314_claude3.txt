Chile's International Cooperation Agency (AGCID) and the Pursuit of SDG 3: Ensuring Healthy Lives and Promoting Well-being

Chile's International Cooperation Agency (AGCID) recognizes the persistent challenges in achieving Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3): Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. Despite significant progress in reducing child and maternal mortality and combating communicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, substantial gaps remain.

A major concern is the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes. These conditions, closely linked to risk factors like smoking, physical inactivity, poor diet, and harmful alcohol consumption, are now the leading cause of premature death in Chile and most countries in the region.

It is essential to adopt a multisectoral approach addressing the social, economic, and environmental determinants of health, promoting comprehensive public policies that foster healthy environments and lifestyles. This involves investing in education and awareness about healthy living, creating safe and accessible public spaces for physical activity, and implementing effective regulations on the marketing of harmful products.

Another critical challenge is ensuring universal health coverage and equitable access to quality healthcare services without exposing anyone to financial hardship. While Chile has made significant strides in this area, disparities in access and quality of care persist, particularly for vulnerable and remote populations. Strengthening health systems, investing in infrastructure and skilled human resources, and fostering international cooperation to share knowledge and technologies are necessary.

Additionally, addressing emerging public health threats, such as pandemics and antimicrobial resistance, is imperative. The COVID-19 crisis has underscored the need to enhance preparedness and response to health emergencies by investing in epidemiological surveillance systems, strengthening research and development capacity, and promoting international cooperation for sharing information and resources.

In reproductive health, while significant progress has been made in reducing maternal mortality, challenges remain, such as lack of access to family planning services, high rates of adolescent pregnancies, and elevated maternal mortality rates in certain regions and vulnerable populations. It is crucial to invest in comprehensive sexual education, empower women and girls, and ensure universal access to quality reproductive health services.

Finally, addressing social and environmental factors affecting health, such as environmental pollution, climate change, and lack of access to safe water and sanitation, is vital. These factors contribute to disease spread, impact food security, and exacerbate health inequalities. An integrated approach is needed to promote community resilience, climate change mitigation, and natural resource preservation.

In summary, achieving SDG 3 requires a multidimensional and coordinated approach that tackles social, economic, and environmental health determinants, strengthens health systems, promotes international cooperation, and fosters community resilience. Only through concerted efforts and transformative actions can we ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.
