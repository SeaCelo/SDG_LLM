SDG 3: Ensuring Healthy Lives and Promoting Well-Being for All at All Ages

By Ben S. Bernanke

The world has witnessed remarkable progress in improving global health over the past few decades, yet profound challenges persist, exacerbated by rising inequalities and vulnerabilities. The third Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 3), centered on ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages, represents a bold and necessary agenda for addressing these multifaceted challenges.

As an economist, I recognize that health is not merely a social imperative but a fundamental prerequisite for economic development and prosperity. Healthy populations are more productive, have higher labor force participation rates, and contribute to sustained economic growth. Conversely, poor health imposes substantial direct and indirect costs on individuals, households, and nations, perpetuating cycles of poverty and underdevelopment.

The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the inextricable link between global health security and economic stability. The virus has exposed the fragility of our interconnected world and the profound consequences of neglecting health systems, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. The economic fallout has been staggering, with global GDP contracting by 3.3% in 2020, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The pandemic has also exacerbated existing inequalities, disproportionately impacting the most vulnerable populations and threatening to reverse decades of progress in health outcomes.

Achieving SDG 3 requires a holistic and multifaceted approach that addresses the social, economic, and environmental determinants of health. This includes tackling poverty, ensuring access to quality education, promoting gender equality, and fostering inclusive economic growth. It also necessitates investments in robust and resilient health systems, capable of delivering essential services and responding effectively to emergencies.

Financing is a critical enabler for realizing SDG 3. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), low-income countries face an annual funding gap of $33.3 billion to provide essential health services and implement priority interventions. Closing this gap requires a concerted effort from governments, international organizations, and the private sector, leveraging innovative financing mechanisms such as sustainable bonds, impact investments, and public-private partnerships.

Furthermore, achieving SDG 3 demands a strong commitment to global cooperation and solidarity. Health challenges transcend borders, and addressing them requires coordinated action, knowledge sharing, and collective responses. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the importance of international cooperation in disease surveillance, research and development, and equitable access to vaccines and treatments.

As we confront the challenges of the 21st century, the achievement of SDG 3 must be a top priority. A healthy population is not only a moral imperative but also an economic necessity. By investing in health, we lay the foundation for sustainable development, inclusive growth, and resilient societies capable of withstanding future shocks.

Achieving SDG 3 will require bold leadership, innovative solutions, and a shared commitment to leaving no one behind. It is a formidable challenge, but one that we must embrace with unwavering determination, for the well-being of our people, our economies, and our planet.
