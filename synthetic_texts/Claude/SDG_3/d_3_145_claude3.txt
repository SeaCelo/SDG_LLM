Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) as if written by David Brooks:

The Quest for a Healthy Society: Moving Beyond Pills and Programs

When it comes to health, modern societies have fallen victim to a kind of credentialist tunnel vision. We have an infatuation with expert-driven healthcare systems, fancy medical technology, and magic-bullet pharmaceutical solutions. But this approach is incomplete at best. Truly cultivating societal well-being requires something deeper - an embrace of the qualitative, psychological and social dimensions of human flourishing.

The statistics hint at the shallowness of our current paradigm. Yes, average life expectancies have crept upward globally. But comparative studies show huge health disparities both between and within nations that cannot be fully explained by income levels or healthcare expenditures. Why does Japan outperform the United States on health metrics despite having roughly half the per capita spending on medical care? Why do well-off suburbs often have worse health outcomes than low-income urban neighborhoods?

The answers relate to factors our clinical, sanitized healthcare industry rarely prioritizes - social cohesion, spiritual moorings, life philosophies, and the cultivation of individual and communal resilience. At a basic level, our bodies are not separate from our minds. Physical vigor arises from mental habits, existential frameworks, and the richness of our lived experiences. A hyper-individualistic society organized around career striving and material appetites will ultimately be an unhealthy one. 

The world's "blue zones," where populations regularĂy live active lives into their 90s and beyond, put little stock in our brand of geriatric medicine. From Okinawa to Sardinia, these cultures tend to blend robust secular and spiritual traditions that imbue life with transcendent meaning. Family, ritual, emotion, and even a tempering of individual ego are seen as tonic. Daily practices like gardening, community bonding, and calming routines reduce mental anxieties in a way our frenzied, screen-addicted societies do not.

It's not that modern healthcare is worthless. Clearly, medical breakthroughs from vaccines to chemotherapy have saved countless lives. But these life-extending tools should be complemented by life-enhancing practices and culture-shaping philosophies that fortify the whole person over full lifetimes.

Some argue these more transcendent aspects of health are luxuries - nice but not essential. Yet, studies consistently show that strong communal bonds, consciously cultivated life-purpose, and spiritual rootedness are among the strongest predictors of societal well-being and longevity, often mattering more than mere access to clinics and hospitals. Social isolation and existential aimlessness appear to be as deadly over time as smoking or obesity.  

The great underdeveloped frontier for health in our era is not medical, but social and spiritual in nature. Policy that falls back on mechanistic healthcare delivery while ignoring the qualitative character of a society is like a gardener obsessing over fertilizer quality while forgetting to pull weeds and prune errant branches. The plants will struggle.

If we're truly pursuing the SDG of universal good health and well-being, we must raise our ambitions beyond just attacking specific diseases. The task is to cultivate whole societies intentionally oriented around the activities, philosophies and communal practices that produce meaning, attachment and resilience - the fertile soil from which vibrant human health naturalĂy grows.

We would do well to study the zeitgeists in places like Costa Rica - where small communities self-organize to build resilient social fabrics and lifelong bonds. Or Japan - where ancient spiritual disciplines like Buddhism still permeate popular culture and shape habits like the ceremonial ritual of gratitude, reverence for ancestors, and multigenerational households. Or Denmark - where some version of secular Buddhist philosophy is inculcated in classrooms, building self-awareness and emotional wellness from a young age.

The path to enhanced population health requires not just new facilities or greater healthcare access, but a broader cultural renovation. When societies produce purposeful, grounded, spiritually coherent human beings, mental and physical health invariably follows. Social trust, a sense of rootedness, and philosophies that de-emphasize ego and acquisitiveness may end up being the most potent preventative medicines of all.

Society's role should be equipping people to thrive in every dimension of their being - not treating them as mere biological machines to be serviced. Expanding healthcare delivery is inadequate for achieving the audacious goals of comprehensive human and planetary health. The deeper work involves carefully cultivating the societal poetry that produces wholesome human ecosystems. Poetry and purpose, not just pills and programs.
