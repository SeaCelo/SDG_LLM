The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) recognizes the inextricable link between sustainable agriculture, food security, and good health, which forms the core of Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3) â€“ Good Health and Well-Being. Ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages is a fundamental prerequisite for sustainable development and a catalyst for achieving the other SDGs.

IFAD's mandate is to invest in rural people, empowering them to increase their food security, improve their nutrition, and break the cycle of poverty. Our interventions directly contribute to SDG 3 by addressing the root causes of malnutrition, which is a significant public health concern and a leading risk factor for various diseases, particularly in developing countries.

Globally, an estimated 821 million people are chronically undernourished, and nearly one-quarter of children under the age of five are stunted due to malnutrition. This stark reality not only undermines human health and well-being but also impedes economic growth and perpetuates intergenerational poverty cycles. IFAD's initiatives focus on promoting sustainable agricultural practices, enhancing access to nutritious and diverse diets, and strengthening resilience to climate change and other shocks.

One of IFAD's flagship programs, the Integrated Approach to the Control of Neglected Zoonotic Diseases project in Mozambique, exemplifies our holistic approach to addressing SDG 3. This project aims to improve the health and livelihoods of smallholder farmers by controlling neglected zoonotic diseases, which can be transmitted from animals to humans. By implementing integrated interventions, such as improved animal health services, enhanced food safety measures, and community education, the project contributes to reducing the burden of zoonotic diseases, thereby promoting good health and well-being among vulnerable rural populations.

Furthermore, IFAD recognizes the critical role of women in achieving SDG 3. Women are often the primary caregivers and decision-makers in household nutrition and health matters. Our projects empower women through targeted interventions, such as promoting labor-saving technologies, facilitating access to credit and markets, and enhancing their participation in decision-making processes. By addressing gender inequalities and empowering women, we contribute to improved maternal and child health, which is a key target under SDG 3.

Collaborating with strategic partners, IFAD leverages its expertise in rural development to address complex health challenges faced by rural communities. For instance, our partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO) aims to enhance the nutritional status of rural populations by promoting sustainable food systems and diversifying diets. Through joint initiatives, we work towards reducing the burden of malnutrition, stunting, and other forms of undernutrition, which are closely linked to poor health outcomes.

Looking ahead, IFAD recognizes the need for a comprehensive and coordinated approach to achieve SDG 3 and its interconnected targets. We will continue to invest in resilient and sustainable food systems, promote climate-smart agriculture, and facilitate access to essential health services for rural communities. By fostering strong partnerships with governments, civil society organizations, and the private sector, we can collectively address the multifaceted challenges impeding good health and well-being, particularly among the most vulnerable populations.
