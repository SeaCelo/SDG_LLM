The Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3), which aims to "Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages," is a critical target that lies at the heart of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. As a macroeconomist and a proponent of the New Keynesian paradigm, I recognize the profound implications that health and well-being have on economic growth, productivity, and overall societal welfare.

At the core of the SDG 3 lies the recognition that health is not merely the absence of disease but a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being. This holistic approach acknowledges the multidimensional nature of health and the intricate interplay between various socioeconomic factors that shape it. From a macroeconomic perspective, the attainment of SDG 3 has far-reaching consequences for the long-run potential output of an economy.

One of the primary channels through which health contributes to economic growth is through its impact on human capital formation. Healthy individuals are better equipped to acquire knowledge, skills, and expertise, thereby enhancing their productivity and earning potential. Moreover, good health promotes longer working lives, reducing the burden on social security systems and enabling a more sustained contribution to economic activity.

The COVID-19 pandemic has served as a stark reminder of the inextricable link between health and economic resilience. The global health crisis has not only exposed the vulnerabilities of our healthcare systems but has also highlighted the disproportionate impact of such shocks on marginalized communities and developing economies. Through the lens of the New Keynesian framework, which emphasizes the role of nominal rigidities and imperfect information in propagating business cycle fluctuations, the pandemic has underscored the importance of robust healthcare infrastructure and effective policy responses in mitigating adverse economic outcomes.

Furthermore, the SDG 3 recognizes the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and diabetes, which pose significant challenges to both developed and developing nations. The economic costs associated with NCDs, including reduced productivity, increased healthcare expenditures, and premature mortality, can impede sustained economic growth and exacerbate inequalities within and across countries.

To address these challenges, a comprehensive and coordinated approach is required, involving investments in healthcare infrastructure, disease prevention programs, and the promotion of healthy lifestyles. From a policy perspective, the implementation of sin taxes on harmful products (such as tobacco and sugar-sweetened beverages) can not only generate revenue for healthcare initiatives but also serve as a Pigouvian tax, internalizing the negative externalities associated with unhealthy consumption patterns.

Moreover, the attainment of SDG 3 necessitates addressing the social determinants of health, including poverty, education, gender equality, and access to clean water and sanitation. These factors not only influence health outcomes directly but also have indirect effects through their impact on economic growth and development. Consequently, a comprehensive policy framework that integrates health considerations into broader economic and social policies is essential.

In the context of developing economies, the pursuit of SDG 3 is particularly crucial, as poor health can perpetuate the vicious cycle of poverty and impede long-term economic progress. Investments in primary healthcare, maternal and child health, and the prevention and control of infectious diseases can yield significant returns in terms of improved human capital, increased productivity, and sustained economic growth.

Ultimately, the attainment of SDG 3 is not merely a matter of moral imperative but also a critical economic necessity. By prioritizing health and well-being, nations can unlock their full economic potential, foster inclusive growth, and pave the way for a more prosperous and sustainable future. As a macroeconomist, I firmly believe that the pursuit of SDG 3 should be a central pillar of economic policymaking, as it not only promotes societal welfare but also contributes to long-term economic stability and resilience.
