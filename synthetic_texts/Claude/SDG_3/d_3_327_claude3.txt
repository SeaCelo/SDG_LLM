Israel's Agency for International Development Cooperation (MASHAV) presents this analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 3: Ensure Healthy Lives and Promote Well-being for All at All Ages.

Over the past decade, Israel has demonstrated a steadfast commitment to advancing SDG 3 through strategic international cooperation initiatives. Our approach is multifaceted, leveraging Israel's expertise in healthcare innovation, capacity building, and knowledge transfer to support partner countries in addressing critical health challenges.

At the core of our efforts is the recognition that universal health coverage is a fundamental human right and a prerequisite for sustainable development. We have prioritized collaborations that strengthen healthcare systems, enhance access to essential services, and tackle the rising burden of non-communicable diseases. Notably, our bilateral partnerships with countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have focused on combating HIV/AIDS, malaria, and neglected tropical diseases through integrated prevention, treatment, and surveillance programs.

Israel's prowess in agricultural technology has also been instrumental in promoting food security and improved nutrition. Our experts have shared best practices in sustainable farming, water management, and post-harvest technologies to boost crop yields and diversify diets, thereby reducing malnutrition and stunting among vulnerable populations. These initiatives have been complemented by community-based interventions that promote behavioral change and address sociocultural barriers to healthy eating.

Maternal and child health remains a critical area of concern, and MASHAV has actively supported efforts to improve access to quality prenatal and postnatal care, skilled birth attendance, and essential vaccinations. Our capacity-building programs have trained healthcare professionals from partner countries in advanced obstetric care, neonatal resuscitation, and the management of childhood illnesses. Additionally, we have facilitated the transfer of innovative technologies, such as portable ultrasound devices and remote monitoring systems, to enhance maternal and infant care in resource-constrained settings.

Recognizing the growing burden of non-communicable diseases, MASHAV has prioritized collaborations that address risk factors like tobacco use, unhealthy diets, and physical inactivity. Our initiatives have encompassed public awareness campaigns, policy advocacy, and the integration of preventive services into primary healthcare. We have also supported the development of cancer screening and treatment programs, leveraging Israel's expertise in oncology and cutting-edge diagnostics.

MASHAV's approach extends beyond traditional healthcare interventions to encompass cross-cutting issues that impact well-being. For instance, we have collaborated with partners to improve water and sanitation infrastructure, mitigate environmental health risks, and enhance disaster preparedness and response capabilities. These efforts not only safeguard public health but also contribute to the overall resilience of communities.

Furthermore, we recognize the importance of fostering an enabling environment for research and innovation. MASHAV has facilitated academic exchanges, fostered public-private partnerships, and supported the development of regional Centers of Excellence. These initiatives aim to cultivate local expertise, promote knowledge sharing, and drive context-specific solutions to health challenges.

As we look to the future, MASHAV remains committed to SDG 3 and the overarching vision of leaving no one behind. We will continue to leverage Israel's technological prowess, scientific expertise, and spirit of innovation to address emerging health threats, bridge disparities in access to care, and empower communities to achieve better health outcomes. Our approach will remain adaptive and responsive, guided by the unique needs and priorities of our partner countries, and grounded in the principles of sustainable development, human rights, and international cooperation.
