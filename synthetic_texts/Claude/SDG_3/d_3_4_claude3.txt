The ambitious goal of ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages, as outlined in Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3), has been a focal point of global efforts in recent years. However, despite significant progress, substantial challenges persist, particularly in the face of emerging threats and disparities across regions and populations.

One of the critical areas of concern is the alarming rise in non-communicable diseases (NCDs), which account for a staggering 71% of global deaths annually. Cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes are the leading causes of NCD-related mortality, exacerbated by risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, and harmful use of alcohol. Tackling these modifiable risk factors through multisectoral interventions and health promotion strategies remains a priority in combating the NCD epidemic.

Maternal and child health continues to be a pressing issue, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Despite a notable decline in maternal mortality ratio globally, with a 38% reduction between 2000 and 2017, stark disparities persist. Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia account for approximately 86% of global maternal deaths, highlighting the urgent need for improved access to quality antenatal care, skilled birth attendants, and emergency obstetric services. Additionally, addressing the underlying socioeconomic determinants, such as education, gender equality, and poverty alleviation, is crucial for sustainable progress.

The relentless threat of infectious diseases, exacerbated by factors like antimicrobial resistance, climate change, and urbanization, poses significant challenges to global health security. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed vulnerabilities in health systems worldwide, underscoring the importance of robust preparedness and response mechanisms. Strengthening surveillance systems, enhancing research and development for new diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics, and fostering international collaboration are vital in mitigating the impacts of future pandemics.

Access to essential health services and quality, affordable medicines remains a significant barrier, particularly for marginalized and vulnerable populations. The lack of universal health coverage (UHC) perpetuates inequalities, with an estimated 100 million individuals pushed into extreme poverty annually due to out-of-pocket health expenditures. Addressing this issue requires strategic investments in health infrastructure, workforce capacity building, and innovative financing mechanisms to ensure equitable access to essential health services.

Environmental factors, such as air pollution, unsafe water, and inadequate sanitation, contribute significantly to the global burden of disease. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 13.7 million deaths annually are linked to unhealthy environments. Mitigating these environmental risks necessitates a coordinated approach involving sectors beyond health, such as urban planning, transportation, and waste management, aligning with the principles of a "One Health" approach.

Achieving SDG 3 requires a comprehensive and multifaceted approach that addresses the social, economic, and environmental determinants of health. Cross-sectoral collaboration, innovative financing mechanisms, and the active engagement of diverse stakeholders, including governments, civil society, and the private sector, are essential. Additionally, harnessing the power of technology, data, and evidence-based policymaking can catalyze progress and drive transformative change towards a healthier, more equitable world.
