Here is a long academic article about SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being), written from the perspective of controversial columnist Richard Littlejohn:

A Politically Correct Path to Population Control? An Uncensored Look at the UN's SDG 3

By: Richard Littlejohn, Distinguished Professor of Uncomfortable Truths  

Let's start with the obvious, shall we? The UN's Sustainable Development Goal 3 is thinly-veiled population control under the guise of "good health and well-being." It's the globalist elites once again forcing their agenda down our throats under a mountain of politically correct jargon and Orwellian double-speak.  

Just look at the preposterous targets they've set out - reducing maternal mortality, ending preventable deaths of newborns and children, ending epidemics like AIDS and malaria, and achieving universal health coverage. Sounds admirable, doesn't it? But let's be honest here - it's all a ruse to curtail population growth in Africa and the developing world.

Why else would the liberal bureaucrats focus so heavily on "sexual and reproductive health-care services?" We all know what that really means - imposing draconian abortion laws and heavy-handed family planning measures on sovereign nations. Never mind the religious or cultural beliefs of these countries - the UN knows best when it comes to "managing" populations.   

And it's all under the self-righteous banner of promoting "healthy lives and well-being for all." Spare me the sanctimonious platitudes! This SDG is about one thing: Culling the world's population of undesirables under the guise of improving public health. Just like everything else with these globalist busybodies - it reeks of social engineering and anti-democratic meddling.  

Let's look at some of the other insidious targets. They want to "strengthen the prevention and treatment of substance abuse." Is this about health, or stripping civil liberties through the nanny state war on drugs and alcohol? I suspect the latter to control and criminalize those who dare to make their own personal choices.

Then there are their plans to "substantially increase health financing and the recruitment of health workers." Read between the lines, folks - this is about raising taxes to fund a lavish new government healthcare bureaucracy and army of freeloaders leeching off the hardworking taxpayer. Just another massive drain on society's resources to appease the leftist mob.

Worst of all is their goal of achieving "universal health coverage" - code for socialist healthcare rationing and the complete abolition of a free market in medicine. No thanks, comrades! I'll keep my private care and right to choose my own doctor, thank you very much.

At its core, SDG 3 is really about disempowering individuals and overriding national sovereignty - granting unchecked power to a cadre of liberal elite bureaucrats to implement their twisted agenda on a global scale. Whether it's mandating abortions, criminalizing personal vices, raising taxes for a healthcare revolution, or trampling over individual liberties, the UN is drunk with power and hellbent on social reengineering.

So let's call this SDG what it really is - worldwide healthcare marxism under the phony banners of "health equity" and "well-being for all." We must reject this intrusive, overreaching power grab if we are to preserve any semblance of human rights, dignity, and freedom in our modern society. Our very way of life depends on exposing and defeating this nefarious UN scheme.
