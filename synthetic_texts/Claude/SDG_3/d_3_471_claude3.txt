Here is a detailed newspaper article about Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) as if written for Forbes:

A Healthy World is a Prosperous One: Why Global Well-Being is the Smartest Investment  

By 2030, the world faces an alarming prospect - if current rates persist, nearly 70 million people could fall into extreme poverty due to soaring health costs and lost productivity from preventable diseases. However, investing in robust healthcare systems and proactive public health initiatives is one of the most economically sound moves nations and corporations can make for the vitality of our shared future.

The numbers speak for themselves. Estimates indicate that for every $1 invested in improved sanitation and drinking water, the economic benefit is $4.3 from reduced healthcare costs alone. Scale that up, and the returns are staggering - improved global health could unlock $12 trillion by 2035 from avoided deaths, increased workplace productivity, and reduced poverty rates.

The third Sustainable Development Goal of "Good Health and Well-Being" is not just a moral imperative, but an economic necessity that underpins prosperous markets and financial growth. Sub-Saharan Africa alone loses over $6 billion annually to preventable diseases like malaria, while India loses over $53 billion due to lack of toilets and poor sanitation. These economic drains are like a massive lead weight holding back the potential of emerging economies.  

At the other end of the spectrum, developed nations are battling an epidemic of lifestyle diseases such as diabetes, heart disorders, and mental health issues that incur staggering costs. In the United States, lost economic productivity due to chronic diseases is estimated at a whopping $3.7 trillion per year, while the U.K.'s NHS could be spending over Â£8 billion annually treating preventable illnesses caused by obesity. Clearly, unhealthy populations strain public finances while stunting entrepreneurship and innovation.

The solution? Public-private partnerships deploying capital and resources strategically to create holistic, self-sustaining healthcare ecosystems on both local and national levels. In rural Kenya, Novartis has invested $19 million into training over 6,000 community health workers to diagnose and treat chronic illnesses while creating a distribution network to provide affordable medicines. In India, conglomerates like Reliance and Tata are pioneering models that provide low-cost healthcare coverage and tele-medicine services to underserved populations.

Smart companies realize that investing in healthcare uplifts their workforce, enhances productivity, and expands their consumer base. Healthier populations translate into more disposable income fueling economic growth. By 2030, the worldwide market for healthcare is projected to reach $8.7 trillion, representing an unparalleled opportunity for innovation. The vaccine development sparked by COVID-19 demonstrated how rapidly the public and private sectors could mobilize resources against existential health threats when properly incentivized.

Ultimately, meeting SDG 3 requires bold, visionary leadership driven by the enlightened self-interest of preserving a prosperous world order. Nations that neglect basic public health squander the human potential that drives commerce, while those that incentivize healthy lifestyles foster vibrant societies that attract top talent and capital investment. In our hyper-connected era, planetary well-being and economic dynamism are inextricably intertwined. A legacy of good health may be the greatest wealth we can bestow upon future generations.
