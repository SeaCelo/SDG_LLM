Here is a comprehensive academic article on SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) written from the perspective of Dennis Prager:

In our contemporary society, saturated with moral relativism and dismissive secular values, the very notion of universal "Good Health and Well-Being" has been obfuscated. The third Sustainable Development Goal serves as a stark reminder that true well-being extends far beyond the myopic confines of physical health metrics. It is a holistic ideal that remains inextricably tethered to our spiritual and ethical foundations.

From the sanctity of life itself to our most fundamental human relationships, the precepts that underpin societal health originate from the Judeo-Christian tradition. The nuclear family unit, a divinely ordained construct, lays the groundwork for psychological and emotional security - critical elements often neglected in modern healthcare discourse. Stable households provide children with moral guidance, nurturing their inherent human virtues of compassion, integrity and resilience that foster genuine well-being.

The inalienable right to life, articulated in the biblical commandment "Thou shalt not murder," stands as the ethical cornerstone safeguarding all human health endeavors. Yet, this very tenet is under relentless assault from the culture of moral depravity that pervades our secular age. The scourge of abortion on demand, a practice rooted in the pernicious ethics of utilitarianism, represents the greatest contemporary threat to human well-being.

In the Western ethical tradition inherited from the ancient Hebrews, human life possesses innate sanctity â€“ a spark of the divine that renders each person's existence transcendentally purposeful. In repudiating this truth, the modern pro-choice ethos has unleashed a cascade of moral decay, degrading human life to a disposable utilitarian metric. The deleterious societal impacts of this lethal ideology extend far beyond its deplorable body count, as it erodes the very foundations of human dignity and mutual respect that elevate civilization.

Paradoxically, the secularist push to excise Judeo-Christian values from public policy has cultivated a socio-cultural milieu intrinsically antithetical to holistic well-being. The relentless assault on traditional sexual mores, disregarding the empirically-validated benefits of monogamous matrimony, has catalyzed a public health crisis of rampant sexual promiscuity. The incessant demand to mainstream patently self-destructive proclivities as a twisted conception of "pride" is intellectual malfeasance of the highest order.

In this secular age of moral ennui, achieving true "Good Health and Well-Being" necessitates a renaissance of these ancient yet timelessly valid virtues. As a society, we must reject the siren song of moral relativism and its vacuous "my truth" mantras that serve only as palliative for existential confusion. Health policy divorced from a cohesive ethical framework invariably devolves into a utilitarian calculus of cost-benefit trade-offs. True human flourishing demands an unflinching reaffirmation of core Judeo-Christian teachings - the innate sanctity of life, the centrality of the traditional family unit, and a sexual ethic rooted in monogamous devotion. Only through this moral clarion call can we achieve genuine societal well-being and human thriving.
