The Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development presents this analytical report on the current state of Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3): "Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages." Despite significant progress in recent decades, numerous challenges persist in achieving this ambitious goal, requiring concerted efforts from global stakeholders.

Addressing maternal mortality remains a pressing concern, particularly in low-income countries. While the global maternal mortality ratio declined by 38% between 2000 and 2017, substantial disparities exist across regions. Sub-Saharan Africa alone accounts for two-thirds of maternal deaths worldwide, with underlying causes ranging from inadequate access to skilled birth attendants and emergency obstetric care to broader socioeconomic factors. Comprehensive strategies, including improved healthcare infrastructure, training of healthcare professionals, and addressing sociocultural barriers, are crucial to further reduce preventable maternal deaths.

Child mortality, while decreasing globally, remains unacceptably high in certain regions. In 2019, approximately 5.2 million children under the age of 5 died, primarily from preventable causes such as pneumonia, diarrhea, and malaria. Malnutrition, a significant contributor to child mortality, affects an estimated 149 million children worldwide, hampering their physical and cognitive development. Scaling up interventions like immunization programs, integrated management of childhood illnesses, and improving access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) are imperative to accelerate progress.

Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes, pose a growing threat to global health. NCDs accounted for 71% of global deaths in 2019, with a disproportionate burden on low- and middle-income countries. Addressing the modifiable risk factors, such as tobacco use, unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, and harmful use of alcohol, requires multisectoral action. Strengthening healthcare systems, promoting healthy lifestyles, and implementing cost-effective interventions like tobacco control measures and screening programs are crucial steps in curbing the NCD epidemic.

The COVID-19 pandemic has severely disrupted global health systems, exposing vulnerabilities and exacerbating existing inequalities. Beyond the direct impact of the virus, the pandemic has led to disruptions in essential health services, including routine immunization, maternal and child health services, and treatment for NCDs. Rebuilding resilient and equitable health systems, maintaining essential services, and strengthening global pandemic preparedness and response capabilities are paramount to mitigate the long-term consequences of the crisis.

Achieving universal health coverage (UHC) remains a significant challenge, with at least half of the world's population lacking access to essential health services in 2017. Inequities in access to healthcare persist, disproportionately affecting marginalized and vulnerable populations, including those living in poverty, rural areas, and conflict-affected regions. Achieving UHC requires concerted efforts to address financial barriers, strengthen health workforces, and improve the availability and affordability of essential medicines and technologies.

Environmental factors, such as air pollution, unsafe water, and exposure to hazardous chemicals, contribute significantly to the global burden of disease. In 2019, air pollution alone was responsible for an estimated 6.7 million deaths globally. Addressing these environmental determinants of health necessitates cross-sectoral collaboration, with interventions spanning clean energy policies, improved waste management, and sustainable urban planning, among others.

Lastly, the global shortage of skilled health workers remains a critical obstacle to achieving SDG 3. The World Health Organization estimates a projected shortfall of 18 million health workers by 2030, primarily in low- and lower-middle-income countries. Strategies to address this shortage include investing in healthcare education and training, improving working conditions and remuneration, and implementing effective workforce planning and management.

In conclusion, while progress has been made in various aspects of SDG 3, significant challenges persist, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Achieving this goal requires a comprehensive and coordinated approach, involving multi-stakeholder partnerships, increased financing, and innovative solutions. Addressing the underlying social determinants of health, strengthening health systems, and promoting intersectoral collaboration are essential to ensure healthy lives and well-being for all, leaving no one behind.
