Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) as if written by Barbara Amiel:

Our Modern World's Fixation with Health and Well-Being: A Vapid and Fruitless Crusade

By Barbara Amiel

The unbridled obsession with "health" that has consumed the global bourgeoisie in recent decades represents one of the most misguided and futile crusades in human history. This relentless fixation, crystallized within the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 3 on "ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all," is a prime example of the post-Enlightenment West's arrogant and hubristic desire to subjugate the natural order through bureaucratic dictates and technocratic control. 

At its core, this quest to eradicate disease, erase suffering, and prolong human vitality is an overt repudiation of our innate frailty as biological beings. Despite the astounding scientific and medical advances achieved by brilliant minds, the delusional ambition to somehow "conquer" death itself remains an adolescent fantasy indulged by those blinded by utopian visions. Death is the cosmiccej that restores the elemental balance - it is a brutal inevitability that the shallowest of societies dare not confront.

The narcissistic preoccupation with personal wellness that plagues the contemporary West represents the collective ennui of a civilization devoid of higher callings. Where are the daring conquests, the soaring cathedrals, the timeless artistic achievements that once embodied mankind's nobler ambitions? Instead, we increasingly wallow in yogic contortions, ecological hysteria, and counter-cultural purity cults masquerading as sagacious lifestyles. The "well-being" propagated by SDG 3 is a hedonistic mirage - it merely feeds the spiritual aridity gnawing at the West's liberal democracies through distractions of bodily fetishism.

Furthermore, the myopic emphasis on global health equity is a thinly-veiled recapitulation of the long-refuted theories of Malthus. The foundational premise, rooted in paternalistic contempt for the developing world, admonishes that mass deprivation and premature death stem from overpopulation among the world's poor and colored masses. Yet, the eternal truth so diligently evaded is that life has always been a brutal struggle - a visceral battle to the last breath. Outside the artifice of Western prosperity, life remains what Hobbes rightly described so long ago as "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short." To yearn for some globalized utopia of ubiquitous health and neverending life is the height of Promethean arrogance.

Consequently, the crusading acolytes promoting SDG 3 are the modern incarnation of medieval flagellants, convincing themselves that self-mortification through diet purges and extreme exercise regimes will somehow redeem them from being mere mortals. They are as pathetic as Cistercian monks ritualistically shearing off every last pubic hair, desperate to repress any corporal appetite in the fruitless pursuit of an eternity on Earth.

In truth, the fixation with prolonging life through endless health measures is a melancholic mirage - a secular quest to fill the spiritual void in a civilization that has lost its higher purpose. As humanity stands at the precipice of environmental collapse and nuclear Armageddon, scurrying about counting calories and peddling vegetable powders will ultimately be an anemic response to the epic challenges of our age. Perhaps it would be wiser to revive the sagacious words of the ancient prophets, who grasped that one must endeavor to "meet life with a better technique for dying." For indeed, what purpose is there in endlessly deferring the inevitable?

In sum, Sustainable Development Goal 3, with its vapid preoccupations about fortifying personal health and achieving some emaciated vision of global equity in protracted lifespan, is a testament to the West's civilizational decadence and spiritual depravity. We would be far better served by rekindling those ultimate questions that once imbued the human condition with transcendent meaning - questions that do not recoil from life's finitude, but rather embrace it as an impetus for greatness. Let the pursuit of physical well-being serve only as a humble means to nobler ends, lest we become a decaying empire where once colossal triumphs are reduced to mere survival exercises. Perhaps then we may yet rediscover our world-historical raison d'etre.
