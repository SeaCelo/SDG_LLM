Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) in the satirical style of Dave Barry:

Ah, Sustainable Development Goal #3 â€” the ambitious quest to "ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages." Let's pause right there for a moment. Have the people who created these goals ever actually met humans? Because if they had, they would know that we're basically a species of poorly designed biological robots whose main purpose is to spread viruses, gorge ourselves on cheesy snacks, ignore doctors' advice, and slowly fall apart like a 1983 Chrysler LeBaron in a South Florida drainage ditch.

But never let it be said that the United Nations lacks optimism! With SDG 3, they're essentially saying: "Hey, you know those trillions of humans who spend most of their time sitting hunched over tiny screens, eating fast food, failing to exercise, ignoring basic hygiene, stressing out about money problems, and generally treating their bodies like low-rent flophouses? Let's try to get every last one of them to live an active, healthy lifestyle full of mindfulness, plant-based diets, and daily colonics!"

Sure, why not? And while we're at it, maybe we can teach pandas saltwater aquaculture and get raccoons to take up calligraphy using their little bandit hands. The point is, good health is hard. Just look at the sobering statistics behind this whole SDG 3 thing. Despite incredible medical advances like surgery using robot arms and drugs that can un-dissolve cholesterol buildups, preventable diseases and conditions are still a massive global problem. Every year, nearly 6 million children die before age five, often from easily treatable maladies like diarrhea. Millions upon millions more suffer from malnutrition, poor sanitation, lack of basic health services, and air pollution so bad it makes the exhaust cloud from a 1970's Volkswagen Microbus look like a refreshing ocean breeze.  

But don't worry, because the UN has a comprehensive, multi-pronged plan to fix all that! We're going to "strengthen the prevention and treatment of substance abuse," "achieve universal health coverage," "increase health financing," and, I quote, "substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution and contamination." Yes, just a few trivial little tasks like eliminating air pollution across the entire planet along with every toxic chemical known to humankind. Piece of cake!

Look, I admire the ambition here. Truly, I do. It's like a bunch of second graders got together to solve world hunger by asking their parents really nicely and maybe having a lemonade stand to raise money. You've got to respect the plucky, naive spirit behind an objective as massively daunting as "ending the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases and combating hepatitis" across the entire globe by 2030. Why stop there? Why not throw in curing the common cold while you're at it? Just end all sickness, disease and bad health once and for all with a single, all-encompassing goal!  

In all seriousness, though SDG 3 contains some worthy, if borderline quixotic, public health goals, you have to wonder about the real-world impact. After all, the previous set of global goals, the Millennium Development Goals,  fell distressingly short in areas like infant mortality, reproductive health, and combating malaria and tuberculosis. And that was just trying to hit more modest targets by 2015. The new SDGs, bless their hearts, are attempting to completely eliminate poverty, hunger, preventable disease, pollution, violence against women and children, economic inequality and seemingly every other dire ill facing humankind in just over a decade, using an international budget that amounts to a few years' worth of Marvel superhero movie profits.

But hey, I could be wrong! Maybe the sheer audacity of SDG 3 and its breathtakingly ambitious aims will inspire world leaders, philanthropists, scientists, healthcare workers, educators, and millions of individual citizens to rise to the challenge. Maybe we really can rid the earth of AIDS, eradicate malaria, provide universal health coverage, end substance abuse, and witness the birth of a new global era of clean air, clean water,  proper sanitation, ample nutrition and freedom from preventable disease for every man, woman and child across this diverse, overpopulated rock hurtling through the cosmic void.

Then again, maybe we should just be thankful when we can get people to wash their hands after using the bathroom. Baby steps, people. Baby steps.
