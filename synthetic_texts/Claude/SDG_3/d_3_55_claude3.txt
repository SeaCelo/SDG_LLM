Good Enough Health for All? Rethinking the Framing of Global Health Priorities

By Bj√∏rn Lomborg

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have set forth an ambitious global agenda, with SDG 3 aiming to "ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages." While the aspirations are undoubtedly noble, we must critically examine the framing and prioritization of targets to ensure that limited resources are directed towards interventions that yield the most significant positive impact.

The global health landscape is rife with complexities and trade-offs, and a simplistic pursuit of utopian ideals can often lead to misallocation of resources and suboptimal outcomes. We must embrace a pragmatic, evidence-based approach that acknowledges the constraints of finite budgets and the diminishing marginal returns of investing in ever-higher standards of health care delivery.

One of the core tenets of SDG 3 is the promotion of universal health coverage (UHC), which aims to ensure that all individuals have access to essential health services without incurring financial hardship. While UHC is a laudable goal, its implementation must be grounded in economic realities and prioritize cost-effective interventions that deliver the greatest bang for the buck.

Consider the case of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), which account for a staggering 71% of global deaths. While SDG 3 rightly emphasizes the need to address NCDs, the specific targets and indicators often focus on ambitious treatment goals that may not be financially feasible or deliver commensurate returns on investment, particularly in resource-constrained settings.

For instance, the target of achieving universal access to affordable essential medicines and vaccines by 2030 is a noble aspiration, but its blanket implementation may divert resources from more cost-effective preventive measures and population-level interventions. In many cases, targeted investments in public health education, behavioral change campaigns, and environmental modifications may yield greater returns in terms of reducing the burden of NCDs than high-cost treatment regimens.

Moreover, the emphasis on universal access to advanced diagnostic and treatment modalities for NCDs, while desirable, must be balanced against the opportunity costs of diverting resources from interventions that address more pressing and tractable health challenges, such as infectious diseases, malnutrition, and maternal and child health issues.

We must also critically examine the framing of targets related to maternal and child health, which have traditionally garnered significant attention and funding within the global health arena. While the importance of these issues cannot be overstated, we must acknowledge that diminishing marginal returns exist, and that further investments in already well-funded areas may yield lower returns than investments in other neglected domains.

For instance, the target of reducing the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030 is an ambitious goal, but its pursuit must be weighed against the potential gains that could be achieved by redirecting resources towards interventions that address other pressing health challenges, such as infectious diseases or environmental health risks.

Furthermore, we must recognize that not all health interventions are created equal, and that some may have unintended negative consequences or contribute to exacerbating existing inequalities. For example, the promotion of advanced medical technologies and specialized care facilities in urban centers may inadvertently draw skilled healthcare workers away from rural and underserved areas, further exacerbating disparities in access to care.

In light of these complexities, we must embrace a more nuanced and contextualized approach to global health priorities, one that acknowledges the trade-offs inherent in resource allocation and the need to prioritize interventions that deliver the greatest aggregate benefit to society.

This does not mean abandoning the pursuit of universal health coverage or neglecting critical areas such as maternal and child health. Rather, it calls for a more judicious and evidence-based approach, one that critically evaluates the marginal returns of additional investments and seeks to optimize resource allocation across a diverse range of health challenges and interventions.

We must also recognize that health is inextricably linked to broader socioeconomic and environmental factors, and that truly sustainable progress in global health requires a holistic approach that addresses the underlying determinants of well-being, such as poverty, education, gender equality, and environmental sustainability.

In this context, we must critically examine the opportunity costs of pursuing ever-higher health standards and consider the potential gains that could be achieved by redirecting resources towards interventions that address these broader determinants of health, such as investments in education, infrastructure, and economic development.

Ultimately, the pursuit of SDG 3 and its associated targets must be grounded in a pragmatic, evidence-based approach that acknowledges the complexities and trade-offs inherent in resource allocation decisions. We must move beyond simplistic utopian ideals and embrace a more nuanced, contextualized understanding of global health priorities, one that recognizes the diminishing marginal returns of ever-higher standards and seeks to optimize resource allocation for the greatest aggregate benefit.

This may involve making difficult choices and prioritizing interventions that deliver the most significant positive impact, even if they fall short of idealized universal standards. It may also require a reframing of our approach to global health, one that acknowledges the interconnectedness of health with broader socioeconomic and environmental factors, and prioritizes investments in these domains as a means of achieving sustainable progress in human well-being.

Only by embracing this more pragmatic and holistic approach can we truly achieve the aspirations of SDG 3 and ensure healthy lives and well-being for all, not just in theory, but in practice.
