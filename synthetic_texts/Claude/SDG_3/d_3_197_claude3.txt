Here is a comprehensive academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-Being), written from the perspective of renowned journalist Gene Weingarten:

The Tragically Comedic Pursuit of Global Health 
By Gene Weingarten

Let's get the obvious out of the way - we're all going to die. It's not a question of if, but when and how. And if you think the "how" part doesn't matter, you've never had a loved one suffer the indignities and agonies of a prolonged, undignified death from preventable causes.

That's the sobering reality the Sustainable Development Goal for Good Health and Well-Being (SDG 3) is trying to tackle. With wildly ambitious targets like ending the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases, achieving universal health coverage, and securing access to sexual and reproductive health care services, it reads like an overly idealistic wish list scribbled by a rose-tinted utopian.

But pause and think about the almost farcical tragedy of preventable death and suffering that still plagues our world in the 21st century. Despite the astonishing medical advances of modern science, a child dies every 20 seconds from a preventable disease like malaria or diarrhea. Every year, cervical cancer kills over 300,000 women - nearly all from low and middle-income countries - despite being an entirely preventable disease. Diseases we eradicated from the West decades ago continue to ravage the developing world in what can only be described as an affront to human decency.

The SDG for health is not about finding miracle cures, but delivering existing, proven prevention and treatment tools to the masses. This seems like the bare minimum civilized obligation we should collectively aspire to. And yet, it remains an intractable challenge mired in systemic barriers and hypocrisies that would be downright comical if the stakes weren't so high.

Take maternal mortality - the concept that giving birth is a life-threatening ordeal is something we comfortably put behind us in the developed world generations ago. But for millions of impoverished women, it remains a terrifying reality, with unconscionable disparities laying bare the fractal inequities etched across our world maps. A woman's lifetime risk of maternal death is 1 in 41 in most developed countries. In the least developed countries, it's a staggering 1 in 36. Because nothing says "life is a carnival" like playing Russian roulette by attempting to create new life.

The culprits behind this grotesque disparity read like a laundry list of societal ills we smugly convince ourselves are relics of a bygone era: lack of access to skilled birth attendants, family planning services, quality pre/postnatal care, not to mention systemic disadvantages rooted in poverty, gender discrimination and lack of education. It would be rib-ticklingly amusing if it wasn't so depressingly tragic.

Then there's the issue of non-communicable diseases like heart disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic lung diseases, which now outnumber infectious diseases as the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. A bitter irony considering these are largely preventable killers propagated by the modern lifestyles we've rapaciously globalized - sedentarism, unhealthy diets, tobacco and alcohol use. 

It's as if we've produced the golden goose that finally banishes age-old scourges, only to immediately throttle the poor fowl and usher in a new dark age of self-inflicted lifestyle diseases. Peak human comedic folly distilled into needless, endemic suffering. Cue the sarcastic slow clap.

Despite the heavy subject matter, I can't resist indulging a little ironic jest when contemplating the sheer human audacity of SDG 3's ambitions. Ending preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5. Reducing premature deaths from non-communicable diseases by a third. Strengthening the prevention and treatment of substance abuse. Achieving universal health coverage. 

It reads like the hopeful musings of a bright-eyed millennial envisioning utopian stretch goals on an idealistic vision board. Except it was conceived by the highly regarded, certainly-not-millennial members of the United Nations General Assembly. It's either the height of admirable ambition or hopelessly na√Øve overreach as laughable as it is laudable.

And yet, I find myself rooting for the naively noble idealists behind this quixotic SDG. Perhaps it's my Jewish humor cynically cloaking a shameless well of blind optimism. Because at the end of the day, mocking the hubris of aiming for a perfectly healthy, equitable world is pretty bleak comedy. As paradoxical pursuits go, making the world a place where gratuitous preventable death and suffering are extinguished seems like a worthy joust at those particular windmills.

Yes, the odds are beyond daunting. And the inherent flaws and contradictions encapsulated in SDG 3 lay bare all the most gut-wrenching cosmic ironies and cruel hypocrisies underpinning the human condition. But I'll gladly look like a fool investing misguided hope in humanity's improbable crusade against its baser impulses. The alternative is just too damned bleak for satire.
