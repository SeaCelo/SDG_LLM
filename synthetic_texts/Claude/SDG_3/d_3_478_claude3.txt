The Quest for Global Health Equity: Leaving No One Behind

By Alexandra Wolfe, Staff Reporter

Ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages – that's the ambitious aim of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 3. While substantial progress has been made in improving global health outcomes, sobering inequalities persist, with marginalized populations bearing a disproportionate burden of preventable deaths and diseases. 

"The global community has a moral imperative to achieve SDG 3 for the most vulnerable among us," asserts Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization. "Universal health coverage is the linchpin – a world where all people can access quality essential services without financial hardship."

The shortcomings are stark. Each year, nearly 6 million children die before their 5th birthday, mostly from preventable causes. Maternal mortality remains unacceptably high, with 295,000 deaths in 2017 during pregnancy and childbirth. Meanwhile, over 700 million people are pushed into extreme poverty annually due to catastrophic health expenditures.

Infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria continue extracting a heavy toll, predominantly in low-income nations ill-equipped to combat them. At the same time, soaring rates of non-communicable diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and heart disease have created a "dual burden" that strains meager healthcare budgets.  

"We're seeing a massive epidemiological transition," says Rachel Nugent, Vice President of Non-Communicable Disease Risk Factor Prevention at RTI International. "Developing countries are getting hit by this double whammy while still grappling with infectious killers like malaria."

Compounding matters is the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance, which could make routine infections untreatable and derail modern medicine. Overuse of antibiotics in agriculture and human health is accelerating this looming crisis.

Achieving SDG 3 hinges on bolstering fragile health systems and alleviating workforce shortages, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa which shoulders 25% of the global disease burden with only 3% of health workers. "We need at least 1 million more doctors, nurses and community health workers in Africa alone," states Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO's Regional Director for Africa.

Innovative financing mechanisms represent a ray of hope. Public-private product development partnerships have spurred the creation of new vaccines, drugs and diagnostics for neglected tropical diseases affecting the world's poorest people. Novel funding streams like the World Bank's Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility aim to rapidly unlock funds when deadly outbreaks strike.

"SDG 3 is fundamentally about reducing inequities and extending the opportunity for a long, healthy life to everyone, everywhere," remarks Dr. Agnes Binagwaho, Vice Chancellor of the University of Global Health Equity in Rwanda. "It's an ethical, economic and security imperative – healthy populations are the bedrock for sustainable development and durable peace." 

As the 2030 deadline looms, much hangs in the balance. Will the world step up to the plate and revive SDG 3's faltering progress? The consequences of inaction – millions consigned to preventable suffering and death – are unacceptable in the 21st century. Equitable global health has never been more attainable, nor more urgently needed.
