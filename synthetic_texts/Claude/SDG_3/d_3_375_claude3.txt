The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) recognizes the intrinsic link between sustainable development and global health, as encapsulated in Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3): Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. As an integral part of the World Bank Group, MIGA is committed to promoting investment opportunities that contribute to the advancement of this crucial goal.

In the context of SDG 3, MIGA's role is to catalyze private sector investment in healthcare infrastructure, pharmaceutical and medical technology, and related industries that directly impact public health outcomes. By providing political risk insurance and credit enhancement products, MIGA mitigates risks associated with cross-border investments, thereby incentivizing private capital flows into emerging markets where healthcare needs are often the greatest.

One salient example is MIGA's recent support for the expansion of a leading pharmaceutical company's manufacturing facilities in Sub-Saharan Africa. This investment will significantly increase the region's access to affordable, high-quality essential medicines, addressing a critical gap in the availability of life-saving treatments for communicable and non-communicable diseases alike. MIGA's guarantees have been instrumental in attracting much-needed private capital to this project, which aligns with SDG 3's target of achieving universal health coverage and access to safe, effective, quality, and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all.

Furthermore, MIGA actively promotes investments in healthcare infrastructure, such as hospitals, clinics, and diagnostic centers, particularly in underserved areas. By mitigating risks for private investors, MIGA facilitates the construction and operation of these critical facilities, which directly contribute to improving access to quality essential healthcare services, as outlined in SDG 3's targets.

Beyond direct investments, MIGA's role extends to supporting projects that indirectly impact public health outcomes. For instance, MIGA has backed numerous investments in water and sanitation infrastructure, which are vital for preventing the spread of water-borne diseases and promoting overall health and well-being. Additionally, MIGA has supported investments in renewable energy projects, contributing to the reduction of air pollution and its associated health risks, aligning with SDG 3's target of substantially reducing the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water, and soil pollution and contamination.

MIGA's commitment to SDG 3 is further exemplified by its active engagement with stakeholders across the public and private sectors, as well as civil society organizations. Through strategic partnerships and collaborations, MIGA aims to leverage its risk mitigation tools to catalyze investments that address complex public health challenges, such as pandemic preparedness, antimicrobial resistance, and the rising burden of non-communicable diseases.

Moreover, MIGA recognizes the interconnectedness of the Sustainable Development Goals and the need for a holistic approach to achieving SDG 3. Investments in healthcare infrastructure and services must be complemented by efforts to address underlying socioeconomic determinants of health, such as poverty, education, gender equality, and access to clean water and sanitation. As such, MIGA's portfolio encompasses a diverse range of projects that contribute to multiple SDGs, acknowledging the synergistic effects of these interrelated goals.

In conclusion, MIGA's role as a catalyst for private sector investment in healthcare and related industries positions it as a pivotal actor in the global efforts to achieve SDG 3. Through its risk mitigation instruments and strategic partnerships, MIGA continues to mobilize private capital towards projects that improve access to quality healthcare services, promote public health, and contribute to the overall well-being of communities worldwide.
