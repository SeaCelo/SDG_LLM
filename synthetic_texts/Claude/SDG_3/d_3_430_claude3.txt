Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), the global medical humanitarian organization, has been at the forefront of addressing the pressing challenges outlined in the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3): "Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages." Our field teams, operating in some of the world's most challenging environments, have witnessed firsthand the devastating impacts of inadequate healthcare access, disease outbreaks, and the ripple effects of poverty, conflict, and environmental degradation on human health.

Despite significant progress in reducing maternal and child mortality rates, and combating infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, the path towards achieving SDG 3 remains riddled with obstacles. In the regions where MSF operates, fragile healthcare systems, exacerbated by ongoing conflicts, natural disasters, and population displacement, have left millions without access to essential medical services.

In Yemen, for instance, the protracted conflict has decimated the country's healthcare infrastructure, leaving a staggering 19.7 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, including access to basic healthcare services. Our teams have witnessed the devastating consequences of this crisis, with children bearing the brunt of the suffering, succumbing to preventable diseases like measles, diphtheria, and cholera.

The Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) exemplifies the intricate challenges of responding to disease outbreaks in conflict zones. Our teams faced not only the medical complexities of containing the highly contagious virus but also the logistical hurdles of operating in areas plagued by violence and mistrust towards healthcare workers.

Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the vulnerabilities of even the most robust healthcare systems, underscoring the urgent need for global preparedness and resilience against emerging infectious diseases. In countries like Bangladesh, where MSF supports the Rohingya refugee camps, the pandemic has exacerbated existing challenges, including overcrowding, limited access to water and sanitation, and strained healthcare resources.

Beyond infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and diabetes are on the rise, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. In Lebanon, where MSF provides medical care to Syrian refugees and vulnerable Lebanese communities, we have witnessed the growing burden of NCDs, highlighting the need for comprehensive, integrated healthcare services that address both communicable and non-communicable diseases.

Mental health and psychosocial support, often overlooked in humanitarian crises, are crucial components of SDG 3. In regions affected by conflict and displacement, such as the Central African Republic and South Sudan, our teams have witnessed the profound psychological toll on individuals and communities, exacerbated by limited access to mental health services.

Achieving SDG 3 requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the root causes of poor health outcomes, including poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation. In countries like Somalia and Nigeria, climate change has exacerbated food insecurity and water scarcity, increasing the risk of malnutrition and waterborne diseases.

Furthermore, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of universal health coverage (UHC) and strengthening healthcare systems to withstand shocks and ensure equitable access to essential services. In countries like Afghanistan and the Central African Republic, where MSF supports healthcare facilities, the lack of sustainable financing and skilled healthcare workers remains a significant barrier to achieving UHC.

To accelerate progress towards SDG 3, MSF calls for a renewed commitment to global solidarity and collaboration. This includes increased investment in healthcare infrastructure, capacity building, and sustainable financing mechanisms, particularly in fragile and conflict-affected regions. Additionally, addressing the underlying drivers of poor health, such as poverty, gender inequality, and environmental degradation, is crucial for achieving lasting progress.

Innovative approaches, including leveraging digital technologies and community-based healthcare models, can help bridge gaps in access and improve the delivery of essential services. However, these efforts must be grounded in a human rights-based approach, ensuring that no one is left behind, and that the most vulnerable populations, including refugees, internally displaced persons, and marginalized communities, have access to quality healthcare services.

Achieving SDG 3 is not only a moral imperative but also a prerequisite for sustainable development and global stability. By addressing the complex interplay of factors that impact human health, we can create a more equitable and resilient world, where every individual has the opportunity to live a healthy and dignified life.
