Here is a long academic article about SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being), written as if by author Mitch Albom:

Ensuring Healthy Lives: An Unforgettable Story of Global Priorities

By Mitch Albom

In a hospital hallway, I once watched a man grasp his young son's hand as the child lay motionless, tubes and wires sprouting from his body. The glow of machines surrounded them like an artificial force field warding off the inevitable. The man's eyes were sunken, his face grayed by sleepless nights. With my notebook open, I was supposed to chronicle the scene, but I couldn't bring myself to intrude on that sacred space. There are some things you don't catalogue for public perusal—you simply bear witness. 

At our core, we are all that father and son. Health is the great equalizer, as precarious as a candleflame and yet foundational to life. When illness strikes without regard for privilege, it levels us to the humbling truth that our physical and mental states are as vital as they are fragile. It is why the Sustainable Development Goal of "Good Health and Well-Being" resonates across borders and ideologies. Because in those suspended moments when a fever rages or a limb fails, there is no us and them. There is only the mortal and the caregiver.

Consider the numbers: Each year, nearly 6 million children die before their 5th birthday, often from preventable causes like malnutrition, diarrhea, and malaria. In low-income countries, the risk of a woman dying during pregnancy or childbirth is 1 in 41. Substance abuse claims over 3 million lives annually. The world's poor suffer the greatest burden of disease, which further entrenches cycles of impoverishment. With every untreated illness weakening communities, the global cost amounts to trillions of dollars in lost economic output.

The irony is cruel: While modern medicine has engineered miracle drugs and pioneered surgical wizardry, basic health remains tenuous in parts of the world still fighting for clean water and basic sanitation. Smoke from indoor stoves claiming children's lives. Lack of vaccines leaving vulnerable populations unprotected. HIV still raging in sub-Saharan Africa, stealing futures. Those cutting-edge breakthroughs we celebrate? Too many people never see their benefits.

And yet...it was Hippocrates who said, "There are in fact two things, science and opinion; the former begets knowledge, the latter ignorance." The world now has the science, the knowledge, to turn the tide on preventable deaths. The question is one of priorities and resolve. Are we willing to recommit ourselves to battling ancient scourges with the vigor we devote to finding high-tech treatments?  Do we have the fortitude to make health not just a global goal, but a human right?

I've witnessed the mettle of health workers in the remotest corners of the globe, their hands calloused from digging latrines as much as administering IVs. I've seen clinics where a single computer is shared by an entire staff, the glow of the monitor competing with a naked bulb, but the care remains first-rate, the compassion endless. What if such efforts were turbocharged with proper investment and policy backbone? What transformation might happen?

We could start by guaranteeing universal health coverage and access to essential services. By ramping up prevention through information campaigns and sanitation infrastructure. By investing in robust health workforces, replenishing ranks thinned from migration or burnout. Building resilient structures to withstand pandemics and health crises. Furthering research into emerging ills, as environments evolve under the strain of pollution, urbanization, and climate change.

Because health is more than the absence of disease. It encompasses complete physical, mental, and social well-being. A continuum where a person not only survives, but thrives, enjoying a quality life of potential realized. That young boy in the hospital? If he were to recover, would the odds still be stacked against flourishing due to malnutrition? Would the trauma linger as post-traumatic stress? Achieving Good Health and Well-Being mandates holistic solutions—because human beings are more than biological puzzles to solve.

Each prayer uttered at a bedside reminds us that health is priceless. That cheering a first step is as sweet as applauding any athletic feat. That every person, regardless of geography or circumstance, should have the chance not only to pursue happiness, but the foundational health to experience it.

There will always be illness in this world. Someday, my own flame will flicker. What matters is how vigorously we fight to keep that light burning when prevention or treatment is possible. Because that father's sleepless vigil, that son's silent struggle—it calls us all to action, to compassion, to the core conviction that every human life has equal value when it comes to care and dignity.

Sometimes, the holiest work happens not in grand amphitheaters, but in sparse treatment rooms where the warmth of a caring hand provides the most powerful healing of all. So let us join as nations, peoples, communities—one health corps for our shared humanity—to make these goals a reality. It will be our greatest contribution to preserving that sacred flame.
