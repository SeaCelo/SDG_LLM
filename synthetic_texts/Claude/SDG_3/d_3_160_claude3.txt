Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-Being), written from the perspective of Jonah Goldberg:

The Utopian Folly of Global Healthcare Goals

By Jonah Goldberg

When the United Nations unveiled its audacious Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, few agenda items exemplified the naïve utopianism undergirding this entire quixotic crusade more than SDG 3 — the lofty aspiration to "ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages." This hopelessly broad and nebulous objective epitomizes the UN's penchant for feel-good rhetoric detached from pragmatic realities. Guaranteeing universal healthcare demands top-down collective action at a planetary scale — something modern history has repeatedly taught us inevitably breeds oppression, privation, and human suffering.

The stated targets animating SDG 3 read like a progressive fantasist's fever dream. From reducing maternal mortality ratios and ending preventable newborn deaths to conquering epidemics like AIDS and malaria, the goals simply cannot realistically be universally achieved, at least not without gut-wrenching trade-offs that the bien pensant global bureaucrats cavalierly disregard. In reality, optimal health outcomes arise organically from free individuals voluntarily associating in pursuit of their rationally perceived interests, not through centralized bureaucracies enforcing one-size-fits-all diktats.  

Take the incredibly ambitious aim of providing affordable universal healthcare coverage. Beyond the economic impracticalities — saddling overburdened taxpayers worldwide with multi-trillion dollar costs — such schemes infamously ration care and suppress medical innovation. With bureaucrats rather than market actors setting prices, overutilization and shortages inevitably result, yielding the dreaded combination of soaring costs and declining quality that has plagued government-run systems from Britain to Canada to the U.S. Veterans Affairs hospitals. Procrustean universal schemes also cannot account for significant cultural differences in healthcare priorities and resource allocations. A one-size plan imposed uniformly from Geneva functionally obliterates the pluralism and dynamism that tailors diverse solutions to unique contexts.

Moreover, SDG 3 embodies the toxic supranationalism that subordinates national autonomy and self-determination to unaccountable global entities. By arrogating healthcare policy to faceless bureaucrats far removed from those they purport to help, top-down edicts undermine democratic consent — forged through the unique histories and values of distinct peoples molded over centuries. From Thomas Hobbes to James Madison, our greatest political thinkers understood the folly of entrusting power over individuals' most vital interests to a Leviathan state, let alone amorphous international bodies whose legitimacy remains dubious at best.

Despite the unsavory collectivist overtones, perhaps SDG 3's greatest logical fallacy involves the delusional belief that complex, wicked problems like pandemic diseases can be simply wished away through declaratory goals. This hubristic mentality exemplifies what the late scholar Michael Oakeshott termed "rationalism in politics" — the dangerous notion that human societies can be rationally re-engineered from the top-down through techniques of social engineering. In reality, human health proceeds from decentralized, spontaneous customs and institutions evolving organically over generations. The arrogance of would-be philosopher-kings seeking to sweep away these intricate cultural inheritances in service of abstract ideological constructs invariably triggers catastrophic unintended consequences.

Rather than succumbing to such totalitarian conceits, we would be better served adopting the humble realism of Hayek and Popper — acknowledging the ineliminable role of imperfection and trade-offs in social systems. Healthcare policy should emerge dynamically from a competitive milieu of private associations, market actors, and polycentric jurisdictions — each free to innovate according to local contexts and consumer preferences. Only by cultivating an ecosystem of variegated experimentation and discovery through trial-and-error can we incrementally ameliorate the human condition, free from utopian delusions of one grandiose global solution universally imposed.

In the final analysis, SDG 3 exemplifies how an ostentatious philanthropic scheme nominally aimed at "ensuring healthy lives" in reality poses grave threats to human thriving — jeopardizing pluralism, self-governance, and individual liberty on a planetary scale. We should strenuously reject this latest incarnation of the totalitarian conceit before more human lives succumb to utopian schemes hatched by megalomaniacal social planners detached from the realities confronting diverse peoples worldwide.
