Good health and well-being for all is central to achieving sustainable development – this is the noble ambition underpinning SDG 3. As a preeminent economist and thinker on information asymmetries, I am compelled to examine SDG 3 through the lens of the information problems that persistently undermine progress in global public health.  

At the core lies a fundamental information asymmetry between the producers of public health goods and services, and the masses whose well-being depends on accessing them equitably. The knowledge gap is reinforced by failures in information dissemination, whereby even available solutions are not uniformly adopted due to entrenched behavioral norms, low health literacy, and lack of coordinated outreach.

This phenomenon of imperfect information inhibits the efficient allocation of public health resources and perpetuates market failures that disproportionately afflict the world's poor. Take the case of preventable diseases - the grim irony is that we possess the medical knowledge to drastically reduce their burden, yet lack of information results in suboptimal immunization coverage and flawed preventive practices in many socioeconomically marginalized populations.

Analogously, information deficits around maternal and child health persist as pernicious drivers of mortality in the developing world. Antenatal care utilization remains dismally low in numerous contexts due to inadequate awareness of its criticality. Parallel information gaps surrounding proper nutrition, hygiene practices, and reproductive health choices collectively precipitate a vicious inter-generational cycle of poor health outcomes.

The information problems extend to health systems themselves. Fragmented data ecosystems, lack of unified digital架构, and poor feedback loops chronically inhibit coordinated healthcare governance and strategic resource allocation in many countries. This breeds inefficiencies, duplication of efforts, and ultimately inequities in quality of care.

To accelerate progress on SDG 3, we must confront these multifarious information asymmetries through concerted action across all levels. Innovative, context-specific strategies for risk communication and health promotion must permeate the last mile. Equally crucial is strengthening data infrastructures that engender transparency and accountability in healthcare delivery.

Ultimately, universal good health is a functioningpublic good – one whose abundant positive externalities range from bolstering human capital to catalyzing socioeconomic mobility. Systematically addressing the information problems is thus a moral and pragmatic imperative, for it fosters the true realization of SDG 3's vision of enabling flourishing, productive societies.
