Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) as if written by the economist Alberto Francesco Alesina:

Ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being at all ages is not just a moral imperative, but also a fundamental driver of economic growth and development. As an economist, I recognize that good population health is a critical input for a productive workforce and sustained prosperity. Conversely, ill-health imposes substantial costs on individuals, households, employers, and entire economies through diminished productivity, lost income, increased healthcare expenditures, and reduced investment in human capital.

The global burden of disease remains enormously challenging, with communicable diseases like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria continuing to impede development in many low-income countries. Moreover, non-communicable diseases linked to unhealthy lifestyles are on the rise worldwide, placing immense strains on healthcare systems and sapping economic vitality. Maternal and child mortality rates persist at unacceptably high levels in parts of the developing world. And the growing twin threats of antimicrobial resistance and emerging infectious disease outbreaks jeopardize recent hard-won gains.

Achieving SDG 3 requires innovative, multisectoral approaches that address the social determinants of health and target at-risk populations through the principles of universal health coverage (UHC). Expanding access to quality, affordable healthcare is a political choice with important economic implications. My research demonstrates that public investments that reduce health inequities and shield households from catastrophic medical expenditures can unleash transformative economic benefits.

Specifically, UHC decreases labor market inequalities by enabling workers to invest in developing their human capital and pursue more productive employment opportunities unconstrained by concerns over losing health insurance. UHC also promotes entrepreneurship and risk-taking by mitigating the penalties imposed on those with pre-existing conditions or family members with high-cost medical needs. Healthier children perform better academically and have higher skilled workforce participation, fueling long-term economic mobility.  

At a macroeconomic level, UHC and robust public health infrastructure alleviate the fiscal strains on governments stemming from diminished tax revenues and escalating safety net expenditures associated with ill-health among working-age populations. It bolsters domestic consumption, workforce productivity, and foreign investment inflows. There are also positive spillover effects from reduced disease transmission across open borders.

However, fiscally sustainable UHC is predicated on domestic resource mobilization through comprehensive tax reform, streamlining governance and curbing corruption, and fostering private sector participation. International development assistance focused on health systems strengthening, not piecemeal vertical programming, remains essential for low-income countries to transition to self-financed UHC over the longer term. Innovative global funding streams, such as the airline tax levied by France to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, can complement traditional overseas development aid.

In higher-income countries, mounting healthcare costs driven by aging populations, rising non-communicable disease burdens, increasing overutilization of medical technologies, and inefficient care delivery systems necessitate paradigm shifts in health financing and reforms promoting cost-effective prevention and population health management. Combating the commercial determinants of ill-health through policies like tobacco taxes, sugar-sweetened beverage levies, and tighter marketing restrictions on unhealthy products can bend the long-term cost curve for treating chronic diseases.

Pandemic preparedness and biological threat reduction demand sustained political commitment to global health security. Zoonotic disease spillover catalyzed by environmental degradation, urbanization, and encroachment on wildlife habitats poses potentially catastrophic economic risks that transcend national borders. Financing mechanisms like the World Bank's Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility can incentivize countries to prioritize infectious disease surveillance, diagnostic capabilities, research and development for new medical countermeasures, and core public health capacities stipulated under the International Health Regulations.

In summary, prioritizing investments to achieve SDG 3 represents an immense opportunity to accelerate inclusive and sustainable economic development. A grand convergence in health through scaled-up implementation of evidenced-based, cost-effective interventions is eminently feasible with strategic multi-stakeholder engagement and global cooperation. By promoting longer, healthier, and more productive lives, societies can unlock transformational gains in economic output over the long run. As national health improves, so does national wealth.
