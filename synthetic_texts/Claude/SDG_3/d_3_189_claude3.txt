Inside Higher Health and Wellbeing: A Treatise on Sustainable Development Goal 3
By Mary Schmich

In this chronically ill world, rife with pandemics, malnutrition, and skyrocketing rates of preventable diseases, the audacious quest of Sustainable Development Goal 3 looms immense and complex. The United Nations has charged us to "ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages" by 2030. An Olympian summit to ascend, this peak pierces the stratosphere of our loftiest ambitions yet raises haunting doubts about humanity's vigor and fortitude. But turn your gaze from the dizzying heights we must conquer to the perilous valleys engulfing billions today - where life is a frail struggle against privation, affliction, and injustice. Here, the imperative to act surges from a moral core.

Consider the grim specter of maternal mortality, cruelly persisting as a scourge in too many lands. Nearly 300,000 mothers perished in 2017 from complications of childbirth, a staggering burden concentrated among the world's disadvantaged communities. The medical knowledge and treatments to prevent this scourge already exist; it is the social inequities and institutionalized discrimination that subvert basic rights and human dignity. Shall we idly bear witness as mothers undertake the profound act of bestowing life only to surrender their own in the process? To uphold SDG 3 is to zealously champion universal access to skilled birth attendants and emergency obstetric care as inviolable human rights.

Or behold the seemingly incongruous sight of childhood malnutrition still rampant in our modern age of boundless potential. 149 million children under 5 were stunted in 2018, their minds and bodies tragically curtailed by chronic undernutrition. Adding unconscionable insult, 49 million endured wasting, their frames unnaturally cachectic. Even more perverse, obesity increasingly besets the young, with marketing board-approved diets laced with sugars, salts, and synthetics colonizing their palates and metabolisms from infancy. These dueling nutritional injustices slice short countless bright futures before they spark into possibilities. Defending SDG 3 demands reimagining our globalized food systems to promote dietary diversity, sustainability, and equitable access to affordable, wholesome nourishment.

The blight of infectious diseases also profanes the vision of "healthy lives for all." Though vaccines and therapies relentlessly expand their armamentarium, ancient plagues like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria persist in exacting unconscionable tolls. Meanwhile, novel viral threats continuously loom with chilling inevitability. The insidious COVID-19 pandemic has already stolen millions of lives globally while wrecking asunder our delicate socioeconomic fabrics. Yet these emerging threats find their deadliest kernels in the preventable miasmas of inadequate sanitation, polluted water sources, and rapacious ecological disruptions. The crusade of SDG 3 is to boldly mobilize preparedness and universal health coverage as robust shields not just against microscopic hostilities but against our own hubris and disregard.

No litany of health challenges can eclipse the universal, pernicious crisis of our unbalanced times - the commercial fomentation of non-communicable diseases. The covetous peddlers of unhealthy commodities reap profits by aggressively spreading addictions and risk factors for cancers, cardiovascular ailments, respiratory illnesses, diabetes, and mental disorders. Theirs is a culture of death and enfeebled vitality subsidized by public apathy. Combatting this mercantile contagion of harmful products and lifestyles is a centerpiece of SDG 3's vision of universal health coverage.

Still, our peak aspiration cannot simply rise upon eradicating particular afflictions but soar toward a panoramic embrace of holistic wellbeing across all stages of life. From conception's first exhale to the final benediction of tranquil departure, we each deserve to flourish amid robust supportive environments. Equitable access to preventive interventions, quality healthcare, sexual and reproductive services, psychosocial supports, environmental safeguards, and health-promotive policies are the rarefied oxygen to breathe vitality into our collective potential.

These are but mere contouring strokes upon the expansive, intricate landscape we must envision and inhabit to manifest SDG 3's resplendent promise over the vital decade ahead. The panorama petrifies yet galvanizes - its myriad injustices and cruelties appall, but the frontier's boundless scope ignites our daring and resolve. All that prevents our conquest is the insidious comfort of acclimating to needless suffering amid illusions of normativity. To gain the heights, we must shatter these barren platitudes. We must ungirdle the structural morbidities and assemble robust capacities to foster global health equity as a cosmic public good.

It is a supreme test of our civic conscience and species-spirit. Do we fully inhabit our title as society's vanguards - summoning the moral imagination to uproot the entrenched pathologies sickening our communities and horizons? Or will the urgency yet again asphyxiate upon our feckless inertia as health inequities riddle onward, their impoverishing plumes toxifying our shared dignity? The eternal struggle continues, with all lives and futures binding upon the escalade. For now the trail glares dauntingly ahead, but do not avert your eyes - the vista is staggering.
