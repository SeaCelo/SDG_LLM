Here goes, attempting to channel the irreverent and controversial spirit of Jeremy Clarkson while discussing the nuances of SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being...

What a load of leftist codswallop this sustainable development rubbish is! All these tree-hugging bigwigs jabbering on about their bloody "goals" like it's the premier league or something. Though I suppose if they had an ounce of sense they'd make having a sofa made from recycled Jaguars one of their targets.

But no, instead they've gone with Good Health and Well-Being as goal number 3. Is that meant to be edgy? Because it sounds about as earth-shatteringly radical as recommending people eat food and breathe air. Next they'll be championing the cause of wearing trousers.

That said, I did have a gander at the finer details and I'll admit, some of it is --  and I can scarcely believe I'm saying this -- not completely asinine. Reducing maternal mortality for instance, I can get on board with that. No one wants their dowdybird of a wife popping her clogs after dropping another mouth to feed. An orphan's tears are a drink no chap can savor.

But then they go and undo all the goodwill by banging on about preventing deaths from non-communicable diseases through prevention and treatment. What a crock! Everyone knows the best prevention is to simply avoid being born with the blasted affliction in the first place. Survival of the fittest and all that, no?

As for treatment, if you're fool enough to be stricken with some ghastly malady despite my advice, well then it's no one's responsibility but your own. Personal accountability has to count for something. Can't have the nanny state spoon-feeding us all soylent green from the prima pappa's teat forever.

Don't even get me started on the substance abuse section. Yes, that's exactly what the world needs -- more restrictions and less fun! Why not just install Brave New World-style soma vapor taps while you're at it? At least we'd all be permanently blissed out instead of dourly sober.

The road safety bit did pique my interest though, I'll give them that. Anything that promotes safer, faster, more accomplished driving gets a resounding checkered flag from me. Tarmac-melting speeds, jaw-dropping powerslides, and bone-crunching impacts -- that's motoring at its finest! No namby-pamby having to obey tedious laws and safety protocols. I want an autobahn that travels straight through the fiery gates of Valhalla itself!

All in all, this SDG 3 seems to be something of a mixed bag. Parts of it are the sanest suggestions since civilians were first allowed to own Chieftain tanks. While other chunks are more muddled than a Land Rover driver's understanding of concepts like "momentum" and "inertia." I'd almost be tempted to award it a rubbish in overalls out of sheer pity, if doing so didn't risk attracting the unwanted attention of crunchy environmentalists.

So there you have it - the SDGs in all their glory. A smorgasbord of reasonability and total codswallop all jumbled together like a motorist's worst nightmares. I don't know about you, but I'm off for a couple of burnouts and a stiff drink. At least I'll be upholding a different sort of sustainability goal -- keeping the emergency responders and liver transplant sector fully employed for decades to come!
