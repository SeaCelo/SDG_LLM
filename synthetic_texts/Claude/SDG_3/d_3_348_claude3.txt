The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) is committed to the global pursuit of Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3), which aims to "ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages." Our approach to this crucial objective is multifaceted, emphasizing cooperation with partner nations, civil society organizations, and multilateral institutions to address the multidimensional challenges that impede progress towards universal health coverage and improved health outcomes.

Recognizing the inextricable link between health and sustainable development, Sida's interventions are guided by a comprehensive understanding of the social determinants of health. We acknowledge that factors such as poverty, gender inequality, inadequate access to clean water and sanitation, and environmental degradation significantly influence the health status of populations. Consequently, our strategies encompass a wide range of initiatives aimed at addressing these underlying determinants.

One of our key focus areas is strengthening health systems in partner countries. We collaborate with national governments and local stakeholders to enhance the capacity, accessibility, and quality of healthcare services. This involves investments in infrastructure, medical equipment, and the training of healthcare professionals, with a particular emphasis on maternal, newborn, and child health. Additionally, we support the development of robust supply chains and logistics systems to ensure the reliable distribution of essential medicines and medical supplies, even in remote and underserved areas.

Sida's efforts extend beyond the conventional healthcare domain to address the social and environmental factors that influence health outcomes. We actively promote gender equality and women's empowerment, recognizing their pivotal roles in ensuring healthy families and communities. Our programs encompass initiatives to combat gender-based violence, promote sexual and reproductive health and rights, and enhance women's access to education and economic opportunities, all of which have profound implications for maternal and child health.

Furthermore, we prioritize interventions that tackle the health impacts of climate change and environmental degradation. This includes supporting climate-resilient healthcare infrastructure, promoting sustainable agricultural practices to improve food security and nutrition, and advocating for policies that mitigate the adverse effects of air pollution and water contamination on public health.

Sida's engagement with the SDG 3 agenda extends beyond bilateral partnerships. We actively collaborate with international organizations, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, leveraging our collective expertise and resources to address global health challenges. These partnerships enable us to contribute to the development of evidence-based policies, best practices, and innovative solutions that can be scaled and replicated across diverse contexts.

Monitoring and evaluation are integral components of our approach, enabling us to track progress, identify areas for improvement, and ensure accountability. We employ rigorous data collection and analysis methodologies, drawing upon both quantitative and qualitative indicators to assess the impact of our interventions. This evidence-based approach informs our decision-making processes and allows us to adapt and refine our strategies to maximize their effectiveness.

While significant progress has been made towards achieving SDG 3, substantial challenges remain. Sida recognizes the need for sustained and concerted efforts to address persistent inequalities in access to healthcare, the growing burden of non-communicable diseases, and emerging threats such as antimicrobial resistance and pandemics. We remain steadfast in our commitment to collaborating with our partners, leveraging innovative solutions, and advocating for policies that prioritize universal health coverage and the realization of the highest attainable standard of health for all.
