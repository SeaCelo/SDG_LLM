Here is a draft newspaper article on Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) from the perspective of an op-ed columnist known as Futures:

A Prescription for the Future of Global Health

The central challenge of our era is forging a world where all people can lead healthy lives and achieve their full human potential. Yet today, preventable diseases and poor access to quality healthcare are still robbing millions of people of the opportunity to thrive. The path forward demands bold, transformative action on a global scale—and that's precisely what the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 3 aims to catalyze.  

As a society, we've made remarkable strides in key measures of human health over recent decades. Global life expectancy increased by over 6 years since 2000 alone. We've turned the tide against diseases like HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis that previously devastated entire continents. New medical innovations are saving more lives than ever before. 

And yet, immense inequities and systemic barriers persist. A newborn in Somalia is 24 times more likely to die before age 5 than one born in Luxembourg. Nearly 40% of the world's population lacks any form of basic social protection. And climate change, pollution, and other environmental threats are emerging as the existential health crises of our time.  

This is where SDG 3 comes into focus with its powerful clarion call: Ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all, at all ages. Comprised of 13 ambitious targets spanning maternal health, disease prevention, substance abuse, road safety and more, it recognizes that robust public health systems and universal healthcare coverage are cornerstones of thriving societies.

Realizing this vision will require multisectoral collaboration on a massive scale, mobilizing governments, NGOs, private industry and civil society. It means innovating scalable healthcare delivery models; investing in disease surveillance and early warning systems; and empowering communities through outreach and education. The economic case is clear—improving global healthcare could generate up to $12 trillion in new economic activity by 2035.

But beyond economics, the moral imperative is even more profound. No child should die from a preventable illness. No parent should lose their loved ones to neglected diseases we have the ability to cure. No nation should be left behind as the world progresses towards the highest attainable standards of physical and mental health for every person, everywhere.

Our collective well-being and sustainable future depend on achieving SDG 3. It provides a roadmap for global solidarity, innovative solutions and leaving no one's health behind. We have the means and knowhow to make it a reality—now we must summon the willpower and moral conviction to rise to the existential challenge before us.
