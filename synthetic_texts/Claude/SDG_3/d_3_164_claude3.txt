Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) written from the perspective of advice columnist Carolyn Hax:

When the Sustainable Development Goals were adopted in 2015, the global community took a hard look in the mirror. We recognized that to build a better future, we couldn't just focus on economic progress while neglecting human development and environmental sustainability. Goal 3 - to "ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages" - got to the core of what really matters.  

It's not enough to simply treat diseases after people get sick. We have to promote overall health through prevention, education, and smart policies. Like a good doctor assessing the whole patient, we need to look at the big picture of what affects people's health and quality of life.

That means addressing systemic issues like poverty, inequality, discrimination, and lack of basic services that undermine so many people's chances for healthy lives. It means taking on "diseases of poverty" like HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and neglected tropical diseases that disproportionately afflict the most vulnerable. But it also means getting serious about combating affluenza - the misery, stress, addiction, and metabolic diseases spawned by excess and unhealthy lifestyles.  

Maternal health has to be a priority. Too many mothers still die in childbirth, and too many infants don't survive their first days. Empowering women and promoting family planning are key to enabling mothers to space pregnancies and give their children the care they need to thrive.

Mental health can't be the wallflower anymore, brushed aside because the struggles are internal and invisible. We're finally waking up to how conditions like depression, anxiety, trauma, and substance abuse devastate lives, families, and communities. Investing in accessible, destigmatized mental health support is a moral imperative - and an economic one, too, reducing downstream costs.

And let's not forget the threat of pandemics in our interconnected world, or the looming crisis of antimicrobial resistance undermining modern medicine. Robust health security systems, vigorous research, and global cooperation are essential to protect the staggering health gains humanity has achieved.

Meeting Goal 3 won't be easy, but the path is clear: universal health coverage to make quality services available to all; dramatically increased funding for health workforces, infrastructure, and R&D; policies targeting root social/environmental causes of poor health; and global partnership leveraging diverse knowledge and solutions. It's ambitious, but shouldn't ensuring the basic human right to health be an international priority?

The healthy choice isn't always the easy one. But the costs of poor health - human suffering, economic hardship, societal burdens - are so staggering that prioritizing Goal 3 is ultimately the wisest investment we can make for sustainable development and human flourishing. Think of it as an ounce of prevention worth a pound of cure, times 7 billion people.   

At the end of the day, what could be more important than safeguarding our health and well-being? We each get just one life. With courage and compassion, we can create conditions for everyone to live it as fully, joyfully and productively as possible. That's not just a noble aspiration - it's the only path to building the future we want.
