Here is a detailed academic-style article on SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) from the perspective of political commentator Mark Steyn:

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 3 - to "ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages" - looks good on a billboard. But like so much progressivism it's a top-down, arrogant, anti-democratic project unbecoming of the world's principal transnational bureaucracy.  

Let's start with the basics. Promoting "good health and well-being" may be a worthy aim, but it's far too broad and nebulous to serve as a meaningful "goal." What even constitutes "well-being"? It's the kind of vacuous, subjective term beloved by navel-gazing Oprah-ites. Rather than wasting oxygen on such psychobabble, why not focus on quantifiable metrics like mortality rates, life expectancy, controlling infectious diseases, and the like?

Of course, even such ostensibly objective criteria invite progressive meddling. For example, SDG 3 makes reducing "premature mortality from non-communicable diseases" a priority target. This might seem sensible on its face, until you realize how the UN defines "premature." For them, it's any death before age 70! 

So the UN has decided that life begins at 70. As usual, they're playing provacateur, disrupting traditional social norms and overriding millennia of accumulated cultural wisdom. In most of human history, reaching three-score-and-ten was considered an exceptionally long life. But the UN progressives are scandalized that some people die "prematurely" before the big seven-o.

This outlook reflects the arrogance of a secularized, technocratic globalist elite who believe human existence can and should be perfected through top-down social engineering. It's a utopian dream that will always fail - because no matter how wealthy and advanced a society becomes, ultimately we are all born to die.

Yet the UN persists in pursuing their quixotic "war on death." SDG 3 commits countries to "achieve universal health coverage" through "access to safe, effective, quality and affordable...medicines and vaccines for all." In other words, a massive expansion of government control over healthcare around the globe.

Such rhetoric might play well to the Bernie Sanders crowd. But we've seen how disastrous socialized healthcare has been in practice - from the Soviet Union's disgraceful hospitals to the perpetual crises afflicting Britain's NHS. Lack of incentives, inefficiency, and rationing are inescapable features of any government-run program.

And the issues with SDG 3 go beyond mere ineffectiveness - its policies carry real human costs. For instance, the UN demands countries "reduce the global maternal mortality ratio." A noble aim on its face, but one undercut by abortion advocacy that treats the lives of unborn children as expendable.

Moreover, the financial costs are staggering. Analysts estimate SDG 3 alone will require upwards of $58 trillion in additional spending over the next two decades. Where will this money come from? Inevitably, from more taxation and debt - either levied directly by the UN, or indirectly by forcing member states to raise taxes themselves.

In this sense, SDG 3 amounts to a global health racket, shaking down citizens to line the pockets of a bloated, unaccountable international bureaucracy. It's yet another bold power grab by an organization that long ago abandoned any pretense of upholding Western democratic values.

In sum, SDG 3 exemplifies all that's wrong with the UN today. It imposes a radical, secular, hyper-progressive agenda on nations under the guise of benevolent humanitarianism. It usurps democratic self-governance, diverting precious national resources towards globe-spanning social engineering schemes devised by elites. And it embroils the world in a utopian quest to conquer mortality itself - humanity's oldest failing.

As usual, the "experts" at Turtle Bay believe they know better than the great mass of people how to conduct our lives. Perhaps it's time to return the UN to its original, modest mandate of avoiding world wars - a simpler age before the international body fell prey to arrogance and over-ambition. Only then can we loosen its tightening grip on our freedoms and reclaim national sovereignty over vital issues like healthcare.
