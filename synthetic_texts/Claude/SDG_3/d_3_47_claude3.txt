Here is a detailed academic article analyzing Sustainable Development Goal 3 ("Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages"), from the perspective of Peta Credlin, former chief of staff to former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott:

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 3 sets ambitious targets for improving global health outcomes and achieving universal health coverage by 2030. However, the hyper-progressive agenda underpinning these goals represents an overreach of bureaucratic influence into matters that should remain the purview of national governments. 

While the aims of reducing preventable deaths and combating epidemics like AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria are laudable in principle, the UN's one-size-fits-all approach fails to account for the diversity of challenges and priorities across member states. Developing nations grappling with fragile health infrastructures and endemic poverty require significantly more investment than their developed counterparts. Yet the SDGs make no meaningful distinction in setting uniform benchmarks.

This utopian disregard for economic and cultural relativism is evident in targets like achieving "universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all." How can the UN reasonably expect Pakistan or South Sudan to attain the same standards of public health provision as Norway or Australia? It reeks of hypocrisy for unelected UN kleptocrats to chastise national governments for failing to meet arbitrarily imposed targets without considering resource disparities.

The SDGs also suffer from a troubling neo-colonialist paternalism in prescribing "sustainable" development pathways that could impede economic progress in the developing world. Calls to "strengthen the implementation of the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control" universalize a wealthy nation's indulgence - the multi-billion dollar cost of treating smoking-related illness is one few developing countries can afford to incur. Similarly, reducing "the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution and contamination" requires massive industrialization reforms that could strangle economic growth.

There are further concerns that the SDGs' emphasis on promoting "universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services" could open the door to an aggressive imposition of culturally corrosive programs promoting abortion and birth control over traditional family values in socially conservative nations. The vague language around achieving this target provides a Trojan horse for subversive social engineering by unaccountable UN bureaucrats.

In their overzealous efforts to dictate global health and development agendas, the authors of SDG3 display a stunning lack of humility and self-awareness. The goals represent an arrogant attempt to centrally plan the health policy of 193 sovereign nation states - an effort rendered farcical given the UN's chronic ineptitude, corruption scandals, and lack of any meaningful enforcement capability.

Rather than browbeating national governments with unrealistic utopian targets, the UN would be better served exploring flexible, incentive-based frameworks that empower countries to tailor sustainable public health initiatives suitable for their circumstances. The current rigid model only undermines the legitimacy and credibility of the organization on the world stage.

Ultimately, SDG 3 is a misguided overextension of UN influence that conflates pragmatic goals like reducing child mortality with an insidious undercurrent of cultural imperialistic dogma. Its lofty rhetoric camouflages an authoritarian rules-based order intended to subvert national sovereignty under the guise of promoting universal health coverage. Member states would be wise to view this goal through the appropriate prism of skepticism.
