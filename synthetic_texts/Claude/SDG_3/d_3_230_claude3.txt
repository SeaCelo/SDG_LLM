Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being), written from the perspective of renowned economist Alan B. Krueger:

Ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages is not only a moral imperative, but also an economic one with far-reaching implications. As an economist, I approach this Sustainable Development Goal through the lens of human capital theory. A population's health status represents a critical component of the productive capacity of an economy. Healthy workers are more productive, miss fewer days due to illness, and have longer lifespans to reap the returns on investments in education and training. Poor health can trap individuals, households, and nations in a vicious cycle of poverty. 

The World Health Organization estimates that low-income countries bearing 24% of the global disease burden have access to merely 1.3% of the world's financial resources for health. This stark mismatch hampers economic development and exacerbates global inequalities. Premature deaths due to non-communicable diseases strip away an estimated $7 trillion annually from lower-income nations -- a staggering loss of human potential.

Viewing health expenditures as an investment rather than a cost is crucial. A growing body of research demonstrates that healthcare spending can yield high returns through increased productivity, household income, employment, and GDP growth. One study estimates a $9-$20 economic return for every $1 invested in health system strengthening. Such investments pay additional dividends by mitigating adverse shocks like pandemics that can cripple economies. The COVID-19 crisis underscored the inextricable links between health system preparedness and economic resilience.  

Adopting a lifecycle perspective illuminates the compounding benefits of health interventions. Investments in maternal and child health reduce infant mortality, improve early childhood development, and enhance school readiness -- paving the way for greater educational attainment. Early health advantages translate into higher future earnings and socioeconomic mobility. Conversely, childhood malnutrition and illness can inflict lifelong "scarring" effects that diminish human capital accumulation. 

Neglected tropical diseases like malaria, hookworm, and schistosomiasis especially warrant prioritization due to their insidious impacts on lives, livelihoods, and economic productivity. Deworming initiatives have been shown to increase school attendance while proving stunningly cost-effective. Similarly, bednets dramatically reduce malaria's economic toll on affected communities.  

The health-poverty nexus operates bidirectionally: improved health boosts productivity and earning potential, while higher incomes enable greater investments in nutrition, disease prevention, and quality healthcare. Innovative financing instruments such as development impact bonds can accelerate progress by incentivizing preventive interventions, harnessing private capital, and paying for measurable outcomes.

While global health has made remarkable strides, achieving SDG 3 will require tackling both persistent and emerging challenges. Universal health coverage remains elusive for billions. The escalating burden of non-communicable diseases like cancer, diabetes, and heart disease exacts a growing human and economic toll -- particularly in rapidly aging populations. Environmental degradation, antimicrobial resistance, and the increased risk of pandemics all loom as existential threats without concerted mitigation. 

Ultimately, the moral case aligns with the economic one: ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being is not only our ethical duty, but an investment that catalyzes productivity, accelerates development, reduces inequality, and unlocks human potential on an intergenerational scale. This is the essence of sustainable, inclusive growth.  

By prioritizing cost-effective, evidence-based interventions, strengthening health systems, and embracing cross-sectoral approaches, we can forge a virtuous cycle of better health and greater prosperity -- for this generation and those to come.
