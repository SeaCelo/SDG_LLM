Here is a fictional academic article on SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities) as if written by the late satirist Russell Baker:

The Uncommon Wealth of Inequities 

We gather here today, my esteemed colleagues, to ponder that most perplexing of society's unsolved riddles - the vast chasms that divide our human family into deepening divides, separating the haves from the have-nots, the privileged from the persecuted, the royally enfranchised from the utterly disenfranchised. Income inequality, my friends, remains the great uncivil war of our modern era.

Like a pernicious weed, economic injustice rears its unsightly head across nations both mighty and meek. From the high spires of Manhattan to the dusty villages of Darfur, the bitter harvest of inequity mocks our countless tomes, charters, and covenants exalting the noble idyll of human equality. 

Indeed, while Jeffersonian philosophers may have scribed equality as self-evident truth, the earthly reality offers a far more troubling portrait. The statistics tell a harrowing tale - the richest 1% of humans now possess more wealth than 90% of the global population combined. The gulf between robber barons and paupers has metastasized into a scandalous obscenity.

The consequences of such grand disparities are manifold, as inequality breeds escalating ills across all facets of human development. Hunger, illiteracy, disease, and despair stalk those confined to poverty's nightmarish environs. Even in affluent nations where golden idols of capitalism proliferate, we find the least among us ostracized in soaring homeless encampments and decaying inner cities. What perverse injustice that some bask in unconscionable excess while others craft paupers' graves for their babes!

Yet our reductive impulses would have us attribute such egregious gaps to deficiencies of character or culture among the dispossessed. We espouse the delusion of pure meritocracy, believing wealth and influence to be the noble spoils of industry rather than the immutable inheritance of systemic advantage bestowed by chance of birth. 

My learned friends, our hallowed institutions of higher reason must lend their keen eyes to upending these injustices at long last. We can no longer indulge the self-serving mythologies of our governing social paradigms as mere inconvenient truths. Until we embark upon the audacious dismantling of policies, power structures, and cultural precepts that enshrine inequality into our global order, all of our revolutionary ideals lie fallow like Babylonian gardens.

The hour has come for us to reimagine the world anew with a restructuring of economic systems based not on perpetuating traditional hierarchies but upon a sacred vision of justice, empowerment, and equitable dignity for all. Our charge is nothing short of the creation of a new kingdom of equals under the laws and light of supreme equity. 

For until we cast aside the age-old divides that have stoked the pens of every generation's satirists through tragic comedies writ large upon the human soul, our species shall never truly ascend from the injustices that have haunted our civilizations since antiquity. The work now begins to right these historic wrongs! 

And so I implore you, my dear academics, to take up the holy mantle of unraveling inequality's intractable knots most stubborn. The destinies of billions hang in the balance, yearning for the dawning of their equal station long foretold. Commence your noble revolution thusly, and let justice roll down like mighty waters immemorial!
