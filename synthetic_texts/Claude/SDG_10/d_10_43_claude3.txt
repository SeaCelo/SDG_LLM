Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities) from the perspective of Andrew Bolt, a controversial Australian commentator known for his conservative views:

The Folly of Equality: Why the UN's Reduced Inequalities Goal is Daft and Dangerous 

By Andrew Bolt

The United Nations has decreed that one of its Sustainable Development Goals for 2030 is the reduction of inequalities within and between countries. On the surface, this may sound compassionate and well-intentioned. But when examined more closely, this agenda is revealed as an impractical, damaging fantasy cooked up by starry-eyed globalists blind to reality.

Let's start with the absurd premise that inequality itself is inherently bad and must be eliminated. This defies centuries of evidence and economic wisdom showing that some level of inequality is not only inevitable in any productive society, but indeed necessary to drive innovation, investment, and growth. Disparities in income, wealth, skills and resources create incentives for people to work hard, take risks, and aspire to improve their station. Without that motivation, we would all stagnate in monochrome mediocrity.

The great economic philosophers from Adam Smith to Milton Friedman have taught us that free market capitalism, not socialist reengineering, is the proven formula for lifting masses of people out of poverty over time through voluntary exchange and mutually beneficial commerce. Forced redistribution and artificial equality of outcomes, by contrast, breed dependence, resentment, and a corrosive entitlement mentality.

Indeed, history's bloodiest oppressors—from Stalin to Pol Pot—all falsely cloaked their brutality in phony rhetoric about achieving equality. In reality, their communist regimes created painfully low equality in the pitiful sense of massively impoverishing and immiserating entire populations, bar a privileged ruling class that enforced conformity at gunpoint. Is this really the demented model the UN wants to emulate globally?

The SDG's focus on reducing "inequalities between countries" is also deeply flawed and pernicious. It is a utopian conceit to believe that artificial compulsory transfers from prosperous nations to corrupt, dysfunctional kleptocracies will do anything but sustain malgovernance, create cultures of dependency, and retard the institutional and economic reforms needed for self-sufficiency.

Moreover, this top-down statist agenda completely ignores the organic market forces already relentlessly flattening the world and uplifting developing populations through economic engagement with richer nations. Where India and China allowed market liberalization and integration with global trade and investment, hundreds of millions escaped poverty far more effectively than any bureaucratic UN initiative could ever decree.

Prosperous, capitalist economies that respect property rights, cultivate home-grown entrepreneurship and human capital, and avoid cronyism consistently outperform moribund centrally-planned economies mired in graft. The sooner faddish academics and limousine leftists at Turtle Bay recognize this stubborn reality, the better for humanity.

Ultimately, the "inequality" obsession is a smokescreen for the discredited socialist orthodoxy of coercive wealth redistribution that has manifestly failed everywhere it has been imposed. If the UN were genuinely interested in empowering the downtrodden, it should champion meritocracy, economic freedom, self-determination, and dynamic opportunity societies over coercive statism.

Inequality is natural, inevitable, often logical, and potentially healthy. Poverty, not inequality, is the great moral scourge to defeat wherever it festers. But the path out of destitution is through competitive markets and human ingenuity unleashed, not bureaucratic utopian schemes of imposed "equality" that will inevitably spawn misery, conflict, and oppression on a grand scale. History screams at us to heed these lessons, if only we have the humility and wisdom to listen.
