As a leading multilateral development finance institution on the African continent, the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA) is committed to accelerating sustainable socio-economic development and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with a particular focus on SDG 10: Reducing Inequality Within and Among Countries.

Inequality remains a pervasive challenge across the Southern African region, manifesting in various forms, including income disparities, unequal access to basic services, and the marginalization of vulnerable groups. Addressing this multidimensional issue is crucial for fostering inclusive growth, social cohesion, and long-term stability.

In our efforts to promote SDG 10, the DBSA has adopted a comprehensive strategy that aims to tackle inequality from multiple angles. One of our key initiatives is the Inclusive Growth and Development Program, which supports projects that create economic opportunities for marginalized communities and promotes equitable access to essential services such as healthcare, education, and clean water.

For instance, in partnership with local governments and civil society organizations, the DBSA has funded several vocational training centers in rural areas, providing skills development programs tailored to the local economic landscape. These centers not only equip individuals with marketable skills but also foster entrepreneurship and facilitate access to finance, enabling them to establish sustainable livelihoods and break the cycle of poverty.

Furthermore, the DBSA recognizes the importance of addressing structural barriers that perpetuate inequality. To this end, we have supported initiatives aimed at strengthening governance frameworks, promoting transparency, and combating corruption, which often disproportionately impacts the most vulnerable segments of society.

One notable initiative in this regard is the Inclusive Public Finance Management Program, which seeks to enhance the efficiency and equitability of public resource allocation and service delivery. Through capacity building, policy advisory, and targeted investments, this program aims to ensure that public resources are effectively channeled towards addressing the needs of underserved communities, thereby reducing disparities in access to essential services.

Achieving SDG 10 also requires a concerted effort to address the root causes of inequality, such as discrimination, social exclusion, and lack of political representation. The DBSA recognizes the intersectionality of these challenges and has actively supported initiatives that promote social cohesion, empower marginalized groups, and foster inclusive decision-making processes.

For instance, the Bank has collaborated with civil society organizations and grassroots movements to promote the participation of women, youth, and indigenous communities in local governance structures. By amplifying their voices and ensuring their meaningful engagement in decision-making processes, we aim to create more inclusive and equitable policies that address the unique challenges faced by these groups.

Notably, the DBSA's efforts towards reducing inequality are closely interlinked with other SDGs, underscoring the interconnected nature of the 2030 Agenda. Progress in SDG 10 directly contributes to the achievement of goals such as SDG 1 (No Poverty), SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being), SDG 4 (Quality Education), and SDG 5 (Gender Equality).

By fostering more inclusive and equitable societies, we create an enabling environment for sustainable economic growth, improved access to healthcare and education, and the empowerment of women and marginalized groups. Conversely, addressing inequalities can unlock opportunities for progress in other areas, such as environmental sustainability, as marginalized communities are often disproportionately impacted by environmental degradation and climate change.

Looking ahead, the DBSA remains steadfast in its commitment to reducing inequality within and among countries in the Southern African region. We recognize that achieving this ambitious goal requires sustained efforts, innovative solutions, and strong partnerships with governments, civil society organizations, and the private sector.

Through our comprehensive approach, which combines targeted investments, capacity building, policy advisory, and inclusive governance initiatives, we aim to create a more equitable and prosperous future for all. By addressing the root causes of inequality and promoting inclusive growth, we can unlock the region's full potential and accelerate progress towards the achievement of the entire 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
