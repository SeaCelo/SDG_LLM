Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities) as if written by the renowned author and opinion columnist Shobhaa De:

The Great Divide: Inequality as the Affliction of Modern Civilization

The scourge of inequality has become the hallmark malaise of our era, an insidious disease eating away at the very fabric of societies across the globe. As affluence piles up in the greedy hands of the privileged few, a yawning chasm separates the haves from the have-nots. This obscene imbalance threatens to render meaningless any professed societal progress, any notions of compassion, any semblance of equitable human civilization.  

The harsh truth stares us in the face - inequality has become a festering wound, metastasizing rapidly as globalization's double-edged sword slices through communities. Glitzy cityscapes and sprawling tech campuses belie the squalid underbelly of slums and sweatshops where the 'other half' toils endlessly to manufacture the very luxuries enjoyed by their oppressors. Income disparities have reached such grotesque proportions that the world's 26 richest individuals now own as much wealth as the poorest 50% of the global population combined.  

This jarring dichotomy plays out within nations too - a small, elite stratum swimming in unimaginable opulence while multitudes struggle to survive, devoid of opportunity, of social mobility, of even basic human dignity. India's own 'Maharajas of the Millennia' cut a stark contrast against our greatest shame - millions of children dying of malnutrition, their distended bellies mirroring the moral bankruptcy of their inherited circumstances.  

But inequality is not merely an economic virus - it is equally a discriminatory mindset bred into the psyche across generations through toxic prejudices of caste, gender, ethnicity and religion. The most vulnerable and marginalized sections of society remain confined to the dregs, brutally deprived of voice, of rights, of the simple privilege to exist as equals.

As this repugnant injustice festers within nations, so does it transcend borders - the grotesque reality that an individual's life opportunities and outcomes are largely predetermined by a cosmic lottery of birthplace. Those inalienably burdened by geographies of conflict, oppression and poverty face severely curtailed and circumscribed human potential before they have uttered their first cries. 

Is this the quintessential human condition we have resigned ourselves to in the modern age? To exist as the sum total of our circumstances rather than sheer limitless individuality? A world bitterly polarized between opulence and oppression, indulgence and eternal want - rich nations plundering the bounties of the poor, perpetuating cycles of exploitation under the garb of faux benevolence?

This is a moral imperative that leadership across borders can no longer neglect or defer - it is our abiding generational duty to decisively reverse inequality's onslaught. The path is neither complex nor obscure - reforming predatory global institutional policies rigged to favor the elite, robustly legislating redistributive fiscal mechanisms, empowering grassroots civil society organizations, dismantling the very social hierarchies that seed inequity.

For too long we have turned nelson's eyes to the wretched lot of the dehumanized underclass, consoling our prim delicate sensibilities with justifications of 'cultural difference' or misplaced colonial benevolence. It is a brutal truth we must stare unflinchingly in the eye - our world's inequalities are not inevitable abstractions but deplorable active decisions borne of avarice and indifference. The divide can be bridged if there exists the collective will to dismantle unjust orders, to build newer more enlightened equitable models of human civilization.

That is the lofty clarion we must rally around - the ceaseless quest to secure that most inalienable of human rights...equality. To forge a world where each child, no matter their circumstances, can dream of limitless horizons unencumbered by the shackles of deprivation. Where the intrinsic worth of every human being is inviolably sacrosanct, beyond the indignities of discrimination, oppression or injustice. Only when we have reduced inequalities to the crumbled debris of history shall we have built that elusive just society our spiritual visionaries dreamed of.
