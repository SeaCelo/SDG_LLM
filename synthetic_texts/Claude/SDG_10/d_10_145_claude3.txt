Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities), written from the perspective of David Brooks:

The Moral Urgency of Tackling Inequality

By David Brooks

At the heart of the great human dramas lies a fundamental tension - the tension between our baser individual impulses and the higher moral callings we are summoned to heed. On one side are the gravitational forces of selfishness, tribalism, and greed that draw us inward, tempting us to wall off and exclude the "other." But pulling in the opposing direction are the lofty ideals of human solidarity, justice, and the universal dignity inherent to all people, regardless of accidents of birth.

It is this moral dichotomy that shapes the challenge posed by the 10th Sustainable Development Goal of reducing inequalities within and among countries. At its core, this agenda item represents an attempt to scale the Everest of overcoming our basest proclivities in service of a more equitable, cohesive, and mutually uplifting social order.

The empirical facts are striking. The 26 richest individuals possess as much wealth as the poorest 50% globally. The bottom 40% account for just 25 cents of every $100 in global income growth. Wealth disparities between the ionized elite and masses have reached levels unprecedented in modern times. But figures alone cannot capture the full toll of inequality - the blighted human potential, the normalization of exclusion as societal fractures widen, and the moral stain on our shared humanity.

At one level, the imperative to level life's playing field flows from the cool logic of economic efficiency - enabling talented individuals from all rungs to climb as far as their capacities can take them. Concentrating resources and opportunity among the few while leaving whole segments behind is an egregious talent-waste. 

But the deeper call transcends mere utility maximization. It speaks to our faiths' most sacred teachings about the inherent dignity of all people as children under a shared divine Source. The rabbis implored: "Whoever destroys a single life, it is as if they destroyed an entire world. And whoever preserves a single life, it is as if they preserved an entire world." The Quran asserts, "All people are a single nation." And Christ's parable of the sheep and goats reminds that in ministering to the least among us, we minister to the Lord Himself.

Tackling global inequality then becomes more than technocratic box-checking; it dawns as a transcendent moral calling to see the image of God in the struggles of the oppressed billions globally - those denied life's basic dignities like adequate nutrition, clean water, education, and healthcare. It means building a world of shared sacrifice and mutual ethical commitment where humanity's preciousness is not degraded through accidents of birthplace, race, or parental status.

Of course, the tradeoffs are real. Reducing inequality through higher taxes and wealth redistribution may dampen growth incentives. Expecting the self-made billionaire to sacrifice more of their fortune triggers primal resistance. Suspicion thrives that those reaping greater shares of prosperity have earned it through talent and drive while those scraping by lack the grit and responsibility ethic to pull themselves up. Echoing down the ages of human civilization is the siren song to hoard, exclude, and fortify against encroachments on hard-earned privilege.

But let us remember the immortal words of the Prophet Isaiah inscribed on the Liberty Bell: "Proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof." True liberty is indivisible; we cannot uphold our own while tolerating the continued bondage of others. Our fates as a human family are interlinked. For every injustice permitted to metastasize, a measure of our common moral health is sapped. Every person left behind in the march of progress chains the conscience of all.

So while the goal of reduced inequality surfaces daunting challenges, it presents an unrivaled moral opportunity to give full-throated expression to the most ennobling values embedded within our respective faiths and philosophies. It is a chance to repudiate the petty impulses of tribalism and transcend zero-sum thinking in favor of positive-sum human solidarities. In clearing the way for billions to flourish as dignified equals, it is nothing less than a calling to midwife a more grace-infused world.
