Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities) from the perspective of writer Mark Steyn:

The Unsustainable Mirage of "Equality" and Its Threat to Western Civilization

By Mark Steyn

The grand utopian vision of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals is a rehash of every bankrupt liberal fantasy that has brought the West to its knees over the last half-century. Chief among these misguided aims is SDG 10 - the push to "reduce inequality within and among countries." This crusade for equality is not merely economically ruinous, but an existential danger to society's pillars of democracy, innovation, and cultural preservation.

The egalitarian fetishists behind this goal operate under the delusional premise that human beings are essentially identical units that can be hammered into equivalent social and financial strata through sheer willpower and punitive redistribution. This hubris stands in direct opposition to the realities of human nature - the immutable variations in talent, drive, decision-making and genetic constitutions that naturally manifest differing life outcomes. Inequality is the natural, healthy state of a vibrant society that channels these human differences into positive-sum exchange and economic growth. 

The anointed bureaucrats and NGOs pursuing SDG 10 are truly peddling a new secular religion, complete with its own utopian doctrines and socialist catechisms masquerading under the banner of "sustainability." It is a regressive faith, rejecting millennia of evidence that human progress and prosperity are spurred by the very inequalities they pathologize. In reality, material want and poverty are alleviated not by an artificial flattening of outcomes, but by the innovations born of the unequal talents of the enlightened few - the Edisons, Fords, and Jobses whose visions could never emerge from tidy, homogenized equality.

The audacious goal of erasing inequality within nations is fundamentally at odds with liberty and private property rights, the cornerstones of Western democracy. The authoritarian strongmen who envision themselves as enlightened equalizers will inevitably impose their leveling by force, dismantling the dispersed sources of wealth and empowerment that compete with the power of the centralized state. The pathways to creating a more equal society are inherently coercive: punishing achievement through confiscatory taxes, devaluing human capital with open borders, and scuttling the family unit that has long cultivated the intergenerational transfer of wisdom and motivation.

Attempting to abolish inequality between nations is even more quixotic given the wildly divergent cultural values, institutional norms, and demographic forces that shape each society. This global pursuit of "equity" would effectively grind all Western nations down to a lowest common denominator of malaise, stripping away the prosperity and freedoms that made them quintessential human havens in the first place. Rather than allow the inequality that rewards and attracts human capital, the UN's grand design would institute a race to equal squalor and repression.  

The secular religion of egalitarian dogma must be recognized for the regressive force it represents. Far from promoting "sustainable development," it forges the path to civilizational decl ine - dismantling property rights, innovation incentives, cultural distinctions, and upward mobility itself in fealty to a mirage of enforced, coerced equality. The self-immolation required to realize SDG 10 is truly unsustainable. It is a roadmap to entropy, grey devastation, and a new Dark Age where therelentless onslaught of corrosive "equity" extinguishes all human brilliance.
