Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities) from the perspective of the late economist Walter E. Williams:

The Pursuit of Equality Is Misguided and Threatens Prosperity

By the late Walter E. Williams 

One of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals is the reduction of inequality within and among countries. The rallying cry for this goal is rooted in envy - the ill-favored viewing of others' success. But inequality is an inescapable reality of life. It arises naturally from people's differing abilities, efforts, talents, and other circumstances. Some people are taller than others. Some people are better looking than others. Should we intervene to promote equality in height or looks? Of course not.

The push for income equality represents a zero-sum mindset where one person's gain is viewed as another's loss. But the derivation of wealth is not that way at all. Growing wealth through productive activities is not a fixed pie. Just look at how standards of living have improved across the world over the past century. According to free market capitalist philosophy, greater wealth inequalities are evidence that the pie is growing - not that some people are taking an unfair share. 

When people observe others with greater wealth, instead of viewing it as a spur for self-improvement, they view it as an occasion for complaint and envy. There are two philosophic sources of envy rationalizations. The first is the mainstream of 20th century economic thought which posits a strict limitation on a nation's output based on its labor and capital resources. If some have more, others must have less - a fixed pie. Fortunately, thinkers like F.A. Hayek and Ludwig von Mises have demonstrated this view is mistaken.

The second source is egalitarian philosophy, where the agenda is to maximize the welfare of the least advantaged through radical redistribution of income by force. This interventionist agenda of the U.N.'s development goals leads to policies that stifle economic progress, entrepreneurship, work effort, and economic growth. It enshrines a welfare mentality of coercive dependency rather than empowering people through economic liberty.

The most moral and excellent solution is not to pursue centralized planning and income leveling, but to establish private property rights, enforce contracts, and allow free exchange through open competition. Only this path fosters opportunity, social cooperation, and economic growth that reduces poverty long-term without resorting to destructive income expropriation schemes.

We should celebrate entrepreneurs and economic achievers, not demonize them. A capitalist society of free people pursuing their economic self-interest creates affluence and uplifting of living standards over time. Inequality of income and wealth is the positive side-effect of this system, not a curse to be stamped out. We need more people rising up, not a race to the bottom through contrived, artificial equality.
