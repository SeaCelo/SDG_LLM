As one of the foremost multilateral development banks dedicated to the prosperity of Latin America and the Caribbean, we are acutely aware of the pivotal role that reduced inequalities play in fostering sustainable and inclusive growth in our region. SDG 10, which aims to reduce inequality within and among countries, lies at the heart of our mission and strategic priorities.

Latin America and the Caribbean remain among the most unequal regions globally, a reality that hampers economic progress, social cohesion, and human capital development. Income inequality, exacerbated by structural factors such as limited access to quality education, healthcare, and economic opportunities, persists as a formidable challenge. Additionally, inequality manifests itself along various lines, including gender, ethnicity, and geographic disparities between urban and rural areas.

Addressing these multidimensional inequalities requires a comprehensive approach that encompasses economic, social, and political interventions. Central to our strategy is promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth through investments in infrastructure, productive sectors, and small and medium enterprises (SMEs). By fostering a conducive business environment and facilitating access to finance, particularly for marginalized groups, we aim to generate employment opportunities and improve livelihoods.

Furthermore, we prioritize investments in human capital development, recognizing education as a powerful equalizer. Projects focused on improving access to quality education, from early childhood to higher levels, are crucial for breaking intergenerational cycles of poverty and enabling social mobility. Complementary initiatives in healthcare and social protection systems ensure that vulnerable populations have access to essential services, promoting their well-being and productive capacities.

Governance and institutional strengthening are also integral components of our efforts. We collaborate with member countries to enhance fiscal policies, promote transparency, and combat corruption, which disproportionately impacts the poor and undermines trust in public institutions. Additionally, we support initiatives that foster greater political and economic inclusion, empowering marginalized groups and amplifying their voices in decision-making processes.

A notable example of our commitment to reducing inequalities is the Inclusive Growth Initiative, a regional program that combines technical assistance, policy dialogue, and targeted investments to address the root causes of exclusion. Through this initiative, we have supported member countries in designing and implementing policies that promote economic diversification, improve labor market conditions, and enhance access to basic services for underserved populations.

Moreover, we recognize the interconnectedness of the SDGs and leverage synergies to maximize impact. For instance, by promoting decent work opportunities (SDG 8) and investing in sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11), we contribute to reducing inequalities while simultaneously advancing economic growth, environmental sustainability, and urban development goals.

Looking ahead, we remain committed to driving transformative change through innovative financing mechanisms, knowledge sharing, and strategic partnerships with governments, civil society, and the private sector. As catalysts for sustainable development, we will continue to prioritize inclusive policies and investments that level the playing field, empower marginalized communities, and create opportunities for all citizens to thrive, ultimately fostering more equitable and prosperous societies across Latin America and the Caribbean.
