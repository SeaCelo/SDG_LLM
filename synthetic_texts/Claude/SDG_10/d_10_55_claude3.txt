Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities) from the perspective of Bjørn Lomborg:

The 17 Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the United Nations in 2015 have become a rallying cry for the global development community. However, we must carefully scrutinize each of these aspirational targets to ensure our limited resources are allocated in a way that does the most good for the world. Goal 10 to "reduce inequality within and among countries" should be reevaluated through the lens of prioritizing the biggest bang for our buck.

Inequality is an emotionally charged issue that tugs at our moral intuitions. We recoil at the idea of extreme wealth concentration as millions live in abject poverty. However, the data shows that globally, inequality between countries has been declining over the past few decades. This is cause for celebration, as an increasingly prosperous developing world lifts many out of the direst destitution. Within countries, inequality often increases during periods of rapid growth before stabilizing. Rather than obsessing over limiting the upside of the successful, our focus should be on readily available interventions to increase the productivity and living standards of the worse off.

A major driver of Goal 10's agenda is outrage over the excesses of the ultra-wealthy. However, even radically redistributing the assets of the richest individuals would do relatively little to systemically reduce poverty long-term. A thought experiment: if we confiscated 100% of the wealth of every billionaire on Earth, the approximately $9 trillion recovered could only sustain current annual global spending to fight poverty for around 6 months. Clearly there are more sustainable solutions than eating the rich.

Similarly, we must evaluate policies like heavily taxing corporate profits or investment income. Overtaxing the drivers of economic growth and innovation may satisfy moral impulses in the short-term, but is counter-productive if it leaves humanity with fewer resources to allocate towards lifting up the global poor over the long-run. Unduly penalizing success and wealth creation is a case of the poor cutting off their nose to spite their face.

A better approach consistent with the philosophy of Goal 10 is to double down on proven investments in human capital that have been demonstrated to sustainably build inclusive prosperity. Access to quality education, better nutrition, basic health services, and family planning empower the poor and reduce inequality over time far more effectively than heavy-handed redistribution that destroys wealth rather than creating it. 

My think tank, Copenhagen Consensus, has shown that for around $60 billion annually — less than a week of current COVID-19 crisis spending — we could ensure every child has access to quality instruction, drastically cut malnutrition through targeted nutrition programs, facilitate family planning initiatives, drastically expand TB treatment, and bolster investments in public health measures like malaria prevention and enhanced childhood immunization. This practical policy agenda, derived from cost-benefit analysis by some of the world's top economists, could be a true game-changer in advancing sustainable human development by simultaneously reducing global inequalities and alleviating poverty.

Yes, visibly addressing inequality is an understandable moral priority given our evolved psychological impulses. But we must not let outrage over the symptoms of poverty distract us from cost-effective interventions that resolve root causes. Policymakers should be dispassionate analysts and focus on smart development strategies, not quixotic crusades against inequality itself. I am reminded of the apocryphal quote: "I am not upset that you have a piece of bread. I am upset that I do not have a piece of bread." Let us ensure that every human has access to sustenance, opportunities, and human flourishing. Obsessing over the comparisons will get us nowhere.
