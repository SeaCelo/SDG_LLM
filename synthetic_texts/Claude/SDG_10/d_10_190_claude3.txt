Here is a detailed comprehensive academic-style article about the UN Sustainable Development Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities), written from the perspective of conservative political commentator Ben Shapiro:

The Ideological Crusade Against Inequality Under the UN's SDG 10

By Ben Shapiro

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 10 -- to "reduce inequality within and among countries" -- represents a thinly-veiled attempt to smuggle in radical left-wing economic policies under the guise of humanitarian uplift. The fact is that inequality is an inescapable fact of life in any capitalist system that rewards merit, hard work, and productive entrepreneurship. The inequality we see globally is not a crisis to be solved, but rather the natural outcome of human potential and ambition being unleashed.

The intellectual underpinnings of SDG 10 can be traced back to the failed socialist fantasies of the early 20th century. By seeking to enforce equity of outcomes rather than equality of opportunity, it reflects the antiquated Marxist preoccupation with class warfare and wealth redistribution. Such policies have been systemically disproven by decades of empirical data showing that free market capitalism, limited regulation, and lower taxes on businesses and high-earners are what truly catalyze economic growth and raise living standards for all.  

The arbitrary numerical targets set by SDG 10, like "progressively achieving and sustaining income growth of the bottom 40% of the population at a rate higher than the national average," betray an ideological fetish for government-mandated equality rather than any genuine concern for human flourishing. In reality, a rising economic tide lifts all boats -- the proliferation of billionaires in capitalist societies has coincided with a radical reduction in rates of global poverty and proliferation of broader middle classes around the world. This is the demonstrable record of free market systems incentivizing innovation, productivity, and self-improvement.

Moreover, attempts to enforce these targets through tax policy, wealth confiscation, or heavy-handed regulation of businesses and markets will only hamper economic dynamism and retard growth and prosperity for all. The developed world's most unequal nations, like the United States, also happen to pull in the highest rates of immigration from the global poor precisely because of the abundance of opportunity they provide. And history's most brutally equalizing regimes -- the communist dictatorships of the USSR, China, Cambodia, and others -- also happened to be among the most destitute and immiserating for their populations.

Embedded within SDG 10 are also alarming undertones of racial resentment and identity politics, with its calls for "empowering and promoting the social, economic and political inclusion of all" across vectors like "race, ethnicity, origin, religion, economic or other status." While on its face this may seem innocuous, we've seen how cynical activists and diversicrats have twisted similar language in the past toward nefarious ends, from enforced racial discriminaton in hiring and procurement under the guise of "equity," demonizing Western nations for their historical successes, undermining hard-won principles of equal treatment under the law, and attacking cherished liberal ideals like meritocracy and free speech.

In America, our nation's exceptional story has always been rooted in rejecting the stale identitarian tribalism and collectivist ideologies of the Old World in favor of a society that judged citizens as individuals based on universal human values of freedom, pluralism, and equal rights. The same bootstrap pathways to upward mobility that enabled waves of European ethnic immigrants to thrive here should remain open to all -- not circumscribed by government fiat or the cynical Balkanization of opportunities along racial lines under the pretense of "social inclusion."  

If the UN and its member states wish to chart a viable, sustainable path toward cultivating prosperous societies, reducing dehumanizing poverty, and empowering individuals to achieve their aspirations, it would do far better to embrace the proven successes of free market capitalism and individual liberty rather than resuscitating the rotting dogmas of the radical left. Until then, the SDG 10 campaign represents a slippery ideological slope that all citizens who believe in human dignity and merit-based societies should strenuously resist.
