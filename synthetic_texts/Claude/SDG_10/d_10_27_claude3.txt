Reducing inequalities within and among countries, as envisioned by Sustainable Development Goal 10, is a paramount objective that demands sustained global commitment and strategic interventions. While progress has been made in certain regions, stark disparities persist, particularly impacting the world's most vulnerable nations: least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs). These nations face unique challenges that exacerbate inequalities, hindering their socioeconomic development and perpetuating cycles of marginalization.

Least developed countries, characterized by low income, human asset deficits, and economic vulnerability, grapple with entrenched poverty, lack of access to basic services, and limited institutional capacities. This confluence of factors breeds inequalities that manifest in various forms, such as gender disparities in education and employment, urban-rural divides in resource allocation, and disproportionate impacts of climate change on marginalized communities. Concerted efforts are imperative to address these multidimensional inequalities through targeted investments in human capital, infrastructure development, and inclusive social protection systems.

Small island developing states confront distinct vulnerabilities arising from their geographic isolation, limited natural resources, and susceptibility to natural disasters and climate change impacts. These nations often face high levels of income inequality, exacerbated by their reliance on a narrow range of economic activities, such as tourism and natural resource extraction. Fostering economic diversification, enhancing climate resilience, and promoting sustainable use of marine resources are critical to reducing inequalities and ensuring the long-term prosperity of SIDS.

Landlocked developing countries face unique challenges due to their lack of direct territorial access to the sea, resulting in higher trade costs, limited access to global markets, and constraints on economic growth. These obstacles contribute to heightened inequalities, as remote and rural communities struggle to access essential services, employment opportunities, and economic benefits. Strengthening regional integration, improving transportation and logistics infrastructure, and facilitating trade facilitation measures are crucial steps towards reducing inequalities and unlocking the economic potential of LLDCs.

Addressing inequalities in these vulnerable nations requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the root causes and recognizes the interconnected nature of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For instance, progress in SDG 1 (No Poverty) and SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) can directly contribute to reducing inequalities within these countries. Similarly, investments in SDG 4 (Quality Education) and SDG 5 (Gender Equality) can empower marginalized groups and enhance their access to economic opportunities, thereby reducing disparities.

Innovative financing mechanisms, such as blended finance and impact investing, can mobilize resources for targeted interventions in LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs. Furthermore, strengthening international cooperation, through initiatives like Aid for Trade and technology transfer, can support these nations in building resilient and inclusive economies.

Enhancing data collection and disaggregation is vital for evidence-based policymaking and monitoring progress towards reducing inequalities. Collaboration between national statistical offices, international organizations, and civil society can improve data availability and quality, enabling tailored interventions and targeted resource allocation.

Ultimately, reducing inequalities within and among countries requires a concerted global effort, underpinned by strong political will, multi-stakeholder partnerships, and a recognition of the unique challenges faced by LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs. By addressing the root causes of inequalities and leveraging the synergies among the SDGs, we can create more inclusive, resilient, and prosperous societies, leaving no one behind.
