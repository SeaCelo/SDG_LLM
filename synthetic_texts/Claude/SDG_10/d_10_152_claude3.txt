Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities) from the perspective of columnist Gail Collins:

Reducing Inequality: A Fool's Errand or an Imperative for Justice? 

If you've read my columns over the years, you know I have a bit of a penchant for mockery when it comes to solemn international initiatives. All those well-fed delegates flown in on private jets, issuing lofty proclamations about alleviating poverty and conflict — it's almost farcical. So when the United Nations launched its 17 Sustainable Development Goals in 2015, aiming to solve every global problem from hunger to climate change by 2030, I openly scoffed. Sure, some of the goals around health, education and sustainability are important. But SDG 10 — to "reduce inequality within and among countries" — struck me as particularly naive.

Inequality has existed since the dawn of civilization. It is the result of human nature, ambition, differing talents and motivations. You can't just wish it away with a symbolic target. The haves will find a way to keep having, and the have-nots will keep being left behind. At least that was my admittedly cynical take.  

But the more I examine this issue, the more I realize how profoundly inequality is impacting our world in corrosive ways. And perhaps more critically, how easily this fundamental unfairness segues into seething resentment, social unrest, and a playing field that becomes so tilted as to undermine democracy itself.

The statistics are staggering. The 26 richest individuals now possess as much wealth as the poorest 50% of the global population combined. In the US, the top 1% owns nearly 40% of the nation's wealth while the bottom 80% has just 7%. This wealth concentration continues escalating, with over $2 billion added to the fortunes of American billionaires every single day during the pandemic. Oxfam refers to this sordid trend as "the greatest rise in economic inequality for ages." 

And we see the repercussions all around us — a debilitating cynicism that rejects the very notion of fairness and equal opportunity. In country after country, demagogues and autocrats gain power by channeling the anger of those left behind, scapegoating minorities and inflaming cultural divisions. Concentrated wealth also distorts political systems through dark money, lobbying, and regulatory capture that entrenches incumbent interests. Upward mobility grows more mythical by the year.  

Reducing such toxic imbalances ultimately requires addressing root drivers like gender and racial discrimination, exploitative labor practices, regressive taxation, and the market dominance of monopolies. Without a living wage, strong social safety nets, quality education, and secure housing and healthcare as basic rights, inequality will only worsen generationally.  

In short, SDG 10 isn't some utopian fantasy. It's an existential necessity for democracy and social cohesion.

This doesn't mean literally flattening society into an homogenous sludge of mediocre outcomes, as critics of the goal often charge. A reasonably equitable distribution of wealth and opportunity is not the enemy of free enterprise and just rewards for talent and hard work. Quite the opposite — it's what preserves capitalism's moral underpinning and makes people willing to accept the market's verdicts as fundamentally legitimate.  

Admitting my cynicism toward global goal-setting was misguided, I've come to see SDG 10 as perhaps the crucial piece that can make lasting progress on so many other SDGs possible — or futile window dressing without it. That's because suffocating under a weight of inequity doesn't just shortchange human potential; it also sows the angry, polarized tinder for societal breakdown.

So let's roll up our sleeves and finally start giving inequality's invasive spread the fierce battle it deserves. Just don't ask me to stop poking fun at those well-fed delegates jetting off to nice venues every few years to cheerfully re-commit themselves to the lofty rhetoric. I'd lose half my material.
