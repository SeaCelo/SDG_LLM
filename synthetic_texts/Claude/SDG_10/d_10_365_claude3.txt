As the global population continues to surge, addressing inequality within and among countries has become an increasingly pressing imperative in pursuit of equitable and sustainable development. At the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), we recognize that inequality is not merely an issue of income disparity but a multidimensional challenge that permeates various aspects of society, including access to resources, opportunities, and basic human rights.

In the context of food and agriculture, inequality manifests in various forms, from unequal distribution of agricultural resources and land tenure systems to disparities in access to markets, technology, and financial services. These inequalities perpetuate cycles of poverty, malnutrition, and environmental degradation, hindering progress towards sustainable development goals and exacerbating social tensions.

Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive and multi-stakeholder approach that acknowledges the interconnected nature of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Inequality is both a cause and a consequence of other development challenges, such as poverty (SDG 1), hunger (SDG 2), gender inequality (SDG 5), and climate change (SDG 13).

One of the key drivers of inequality in the agricultural sector is the concentration of land ownership and control. In many regions, a small percentage of landowners control vast tracts of fertile land, while smallholder farmers and indigenous communities struggle to secure land tenure rights and access productive resources. This imbalance perpetuates cycles of poverty, food insecurity, and environmental degradation, as smallholders are often forced to cultivate marginal lands using unsustainable practices.

To address this issue, the FAO has been actively promoting inclusive and equitable land governance frameworks, such as the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries, and Forests (VGGT). These guidelines provide a framework for recognizing and protecting the legitimate tenure rights of smallholders, indigenous communities, and marginalized groups, fostering more equitable access to land and natural resources.

Additionally, the FAO has been working closely with member states and development partners to promote inclusive value chains and market access for smallholder farmers. Through initiatives like the Participatory Guarantee Systems (PGS), we are empowering smallholders to access premium markets and receive fair prices for their products, while also fostering sustainable agricultural practices.

Another critical aspect of reducing inequality in the agricultural sector is addressing gender disparities. Women play a vital role in agriculture, yet they often face discrimination, lack of access to resources, and limited decision-making power. The FAO's Gender Strategy and the Joint Programme on Gender Transformative Approaches for Food Security and Nutrition aim to empower women in agriculture through capacity building, access to finance, and technology transfer, recognizing the interconnected nature of gender equality (SDG 5) and food security (SDG 2).

Furthermore, the FAO recognizes the disproportionate impact of climate change on vulnerable and marginalized communities, particularly in the agricultural sector. Through initiatives like the Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMA) and the Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture, we are promoting climate-resilient and low-emission agricultural practices, while also advocating for equitable access to climate finance and technology transfer for smallholders and marginalized communities.

Reducing inequality within and among countries is a complex challenge that requires concerted efforts from a range of stakeholders, including governments, civil society organizations, private sector actors, and international development agencies. The FAO is committed to fostering inclusive and equitable agricultural development by promoting inclusive policies, strengthening institutional capacities, and fostering multi-stakeholder partnerships.

Through initiatives like the International Land Coalition (ILC) and the Global Donor Platform for Rural Development, we are facilitating dialogue and collaboration among diverse stakeholders to address the root causes of inequality and promote sustainable and inclusive agricultural development.

As we move towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, it is crucial to recognize the interconnected nature of the SDGs and the need for a holistic approach to addressing inequality. Progress towards SDG 10 is inextricably linked to advancements in other goals, such as poverty reduction (SDG 1), zero hunger (SDG 2), gender equality (SDG 5), and climate action (SDG 13).

By fostering inclusive and equitable agricultural development, we not only contribute to reducing inequality but also lay the foundation for sustainable economic growth, social cohesion, and environmental stewardship. The path forward requires collective action, innovative solutions, and a unwavering commitment to leaving no one behind.
