Here is a detailed academic article about the Sustainable Development Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities) as if written by Simon Jenkins:

Inequality Rendered Unsustainable: A Critique on the Folly of SDG 10

The clarion call for "reduced inequalities" as trumpeted by the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goal 10 is a commendable aspiration smothered by a deplorable lack of ambition. In keeping with the UN's notoriously sluggish and bureaucratic responsiveness to existential societal challenges, this goal meekly tiptoes around the burning issue of inequality in the modern era rather than extinguishing the insidious flames with decisive conviction.  

At its cosmetic core, SDG 10 advocates for little more than feel-good niceties – the reheated leftovers of ineffectual "poverty reduction" schemes repackaged under the glossy varnish of sustainability jargon. It calls for steady progress in raising incomes, ensuring inclusivity, promulgating non-discriminatory policies, and facilitating "orderly" migration. A litany of well-intentioned platitudes, no doubt, but painfully detached from the gut-wrenching realities of chasmic inequities that persist in stratifying the human race.

One need only survey the unconscionable opulence of the pampered global elite – the soulless titans sprawled atop their sectarian corporate empires or bloated with swindled billions accrued through kleptocratic regimes – hauling in obscene wealth at a rate outpacing that of 95% of the world's population. This grotesque spectacle is juxtaposed against the unforgivable destitution smothering billions globally – the "wretched refuse" damned by circumstances of birth to eke out sub-human existences marred by malnutrition, preventable disease, illiteracy, and violence.  

Such profound disparities make a mockery of the SDG's tepid targets of revenue sharing and "empowering" of social sectors. While theoretically laudable, these prescribed remedies naively discount the pernicious and deeply entrenched power structures upholding the global status quo. A more radical and uncompromising paradigm shift is demanded – one that fundamentally disrupts the self-perpetuating cycles of greed and exploitation maintaining such rapacious imbalances.  

Rather than nibbling fecklessly at the heels of inequality, the UN must mobilize concerted efforts to dismantle the very foundations of its existence. The stranglehold of corporate oligopolies must be obliterated, nepotistic cronyism dismantled, institutionalized racism and discrimination stamped into oblivion. The tyrannical hegemony of the hyper-wealthy over the global financial architecture, from tax havens and offshored coffers to shadow banking and regulatory capture, must be surgically excised. Common patrimony resources must be democratized for the collective benefit of all humanity rather than plundered to satiate the conspicuous consumption of a voracious minority.  

Without such seismic upheavals, the tinkering and placatory rhetoric embodied in SDG 10 is little more than a self-congratulatory charade that sustains rather than confronts the moral and existential rot of inequality. Those sincerely devoted to the noble cause of a more egalitarian world – a harmonious equilibrium in which all humans partake in the pursuit of enriched potentialities – must reject such milquetoast half-measures. Only through brazen, uncompromising demolition of the malignant forces that spawn inequality can humanity stride towards a sustainable trajectory aligned with our immutable moral imperatives.  

The choice is clear: nostalgic adherence to the self-serving pretenses embodied by SDG 10, or the courageous embrace of sweeping transformation demanded to birth a truly equitable world order. Dare we continue indulging the former at the eternal cost of the latter?
