Here is a detailed academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities), written from the perspective of Barbara Amiel:

Inequality is the great conundrum of our age. As the howling masses clamor for their piece of the proverbial pie, the intelligentsia prattle on about equality and social justice, blissfully unaware of the calamitous consequences their policies would wreak.

Let's start with the harsh reality - inequality is an immutable fact of life. It is the motivating force that drives human ambition and achievement. Without the inspiriting prospect of ascending to dizzying heights of wealth and status, what impetus would the common man have to excel? Our vaunted "meritocratic" society would devolve into a stagnant morass of complacent mediocrity.

The intellectual parlor pinks may lament income inequality, but what of cognitive inequality? Are we to legislate away the intellectual spoils that separate the philosophically gifted from the ungifted masses? Perhaps we could have a Khmer Rouge-style intellectual purge to level the playing field. I jest, of course, but the same faulty egalitarian reasoning underpins both misguided aims.

By contrast, I prefer the elegant inequities that flow from the remorseless laws of the market. The frisson of untrammeled capitalism, that divine orchestrator of inequality, vivifies the human spirit and propels civilization ever forward on the Schumpeterian wings of creative destruction.

The SDG framework, in its typical UN fashion, pays little more than tawdry lip service to this existential reality. The few crumbs it does offer are subsumed within an anodyne, utopian agenda that holds inequality as an outright evil to be stamped out. A risible inversion of the natural order if ever there was one.

Its buzz-wordy targets babble inanely about "promoting appropriate legislation" and "adopting fiscal, wage, and social protection policies" to progressively achieve greater equality. A cursory look at the inequality Gini coefficients across countries with varying policy regimes lays bare the futility of such misguided government interventions.

Rather than fruitlessly assailing the inequalities that propel the Schumpeterian motor of capitalist progress, we would be better served doubling down on our commitment to unfettered markets and the rule of law. Embrace the churning miasma of creative destruction that births the soaring peaks of inequality which are the zesty
byproduct of a healthy economy.

Poverty, oppression, and subjugation are society's true ills - residual vestiges of the pre-capitalist dark ages. Eradicating these will organically diminish deleterious inequalities over time. However, let's not confuse the inequality begotten of oppression with the fecund inequality that arises from human ingenuity flourishing in a milieu of economic freedom. One is cause for despair, while the other seeds the very essence of human thriving.

In conclusion, SDG 10 is a well-intentioned muddle that fundamentally misapprehends the nature of inequality in capitalist societies. By fetishizing a quixotic conception of equality, it threatens the very dynamism that ameliorates mankind's plight over time. We must reject the siren song of coercive egalitarianism and fully embrace the regenerative powers of market-based inequality. From that fertile crucible emerges the innovative vitality that cultivates broad-based prosperity.
