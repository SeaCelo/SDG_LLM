Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities) as if written by Brendan O'Neill:

The Pernicious Agenda Behind the UN's "Reduced Inequalities" Goal

By Brendan O'Neill

At first glance, the 10th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) endorsed by the United Nations - to "reduce inequality within and among countries" - might seem like an innocuous, even noble aim. However, upon closer inspection it becomes clear that this SDG is merely a Trojan horse for an insidious left-wing ideology that threatens economic freedom and national sovereignty. The real agenda is not about lifting up the poor, as its proponents dishonestly claim, but rather tearing down the wealthy and successful through punitive wealth redistribution schemes.

The primary indicator used to measure progress on SDG 10 is the labour income share of GDP. Yet what this metric explicitly calls for is suppressing runaway economic growth in the name of reducing inequality between high and low-income countries. It enshrines the anti-growth mentality of the environmental extremists into global policy. Economic vibrancy is reframed as a sin against global equality rather than a catalyst for uplifting human wellbeing across all nations.

Furthermore, the associated targets for SDG 10 reveal a clear progressive conception of authority superseding national autonomy and self-determination. Target 10.6 calls for enhancing "the representation and voice for developing countries in decision-making in global international economic and financial institutions". In plain English, this means diluting the economic clout and policy leadership of advanced liberal democracies like the United States in favor of authoritarian regimes and corrupt bureaucracies with abysmal human rights records.  

From its advocacy of open borders and unchecked migration flows, to its demonization of free market policies, to its chilling implications for the principles of private property rights, SDG 10 lays bare the UN's naked ambition to become a socialist world government. The language is laced with code words like "appropriate legislation" and "fiscal and wage policies" - obvious dog whistles for coercive overreach by supranational bureaucrats unaccountable to democratic scrutiny.

The coup de grace is Target 10.b which promotes something called "representation based on enhanced World Trade Organization rules". This is doublespeak for wielding the WTO as a blunt weapon to bludgeon Western nations into unilaterally opening their markets while doing nothing to pry open the closed economies of favored totalitarian states. It has nothing to do with genuine "free trade" and everything to do with looting and extraction of wealth on an unprecedented scale.

In the end, SDG 10 amounts to a radical ideological project masquerading as an economic plan. It cynically deploys the language of social justice to smuggle in an illiberal and destructive political economy at a global scale. Inequality is not a bug but a feature of human enterprise - the natural outcome of differing talents, work ethics, risk tolerances and institutional environments across the world's peoples. Any attempt to forcibly "reduce" these inequalities through UN diktats can only lead to societal rot, economic paralysis and conflicts that will immiserate the very people it purports to help.

Rather than falling for UN utopian schemes, we would be better served embracing the proven capitalist formula: economic liberalization, protection of property rights, and measured sustainable growth. These free market policies have lifted billions out of poverty and ushered in unprecedented prosperity. SDG 10 enshrines the opposite principle - capping the ascent of our civilization in hopes of "leveling" our world to a lowest common denominator. It is a reactionary and regressive path that any student of history should approach with open skepticism.
