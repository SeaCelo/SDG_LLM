Save the Children is deeply committed to the realization of the Sustainable Development Goal 10, which aims to reduce inequalities within and among countries. Our organization recognizes that inequality is a multidimensional challenge that encompasses disparities in income, wealth, opportunities, and access to essential services, among other factors. Addressing these inequalities is a fundamental prerequisite for achieving sustainable development and ensuring that no one is left behind.

Our analysis of the current state of SDG 10 reveals a sobering reality. Despite the progress made in certain areas, inequality continues to persist and, in some cases, has even increased globally. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing disparities, disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable populations, including children, women, and marginalized communities.

Income inequality remains a pressing concern, with the richest 10% of the global population earning up to 40% of total income, while the poorest 10% receive less than 3%. This staggering gap not only undermines social cohesion but also perpetuates cycles of poverty and hinders economic growth. Moreover, wealth concentration is even more pronounced, with the top 1% owning nearly half of the world's wealth.

Inequalities in access to education, healthcare, and basic services are equally alarming. In many developing countries, children from disadvantaged backgrounds face significant barriers to quality education, hampering their future prospects and perpetuating intergenerational poverty. Access to healthcare services is often determined by socioeconomic status, with the poor facing higher risks of preventable diseases and premature death.

Gender inequality remains a pervasive challenge, with women and girls facing discrimination, limited economic opportunities, and disproportionate exposure to violence and exploitation. This not only violates fundamental human rights but also impedes economic growth and social development.

Inequalities also manifest in terms of opportunities and representation. Marginalized groups, including ethnic minorities, indigenous populations, and persons with disabilities, continue to face systemic barriers to participation in decision-making processes and access to essential services.

Furthermore, our analysis highlights the intersectionality of inequalities, where multiple forms of discrimination and disadvantage intersect, compounding the challenges faced by certain groups. For instance, a girl from a rural, low-income family may face compounded barriers to education due to her gender, socioeconomic status, and geographic location.

To address these multifaceted challenges, Save the Children advocates for a comprehensive and multidimensional approach that tackles inequalities at their root causes. This includes promoting inclusive and equitable economic growth, investing in quality education and healthcare for all, empowering women and girls, and ensuring equal representation and participation in decision-making processes.

Effective policy interventions must be grounded in data and evidence, addressing the specific needs and challenges of marginalized populations. Targeted programs, such as conditional cash transfers, social protection schemes, and affirmative action policies, can help mitigate inequalities and provide equal opportunities.

Additionally, we must challenge discriminatory norms, attitudes, and practices that perpetuate inequalities. This requires sustained efforts in awareness-raising, advocacy, and community engagement, fostering an inclusive and equitable society that values diversity and upholds human rights.

Achieving SDG 10 is not only a moral imperative but also a prerequisite for sustainable development and the realization of the other Sustainable Development Goals. By reducing inequalities, we can unlock the potential of every individual, harness the collective capabilities of societies, and create a more prosperous, just, and inclusive world for all.
