Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities) written from the perspective of Maureen Dowd:

The Great Divergence: Inequality's Chokehold on Progress

By Maureen Dowd

Wake up, people! We're amid a slowly unfolding global calamity caused by skyrocketing inequality between and within countries. The ever-widening chasm between the blindingly rich and the suffering poor is fraying the fabric of our civilized world. 

The ostentatious affluence of the few is overshadowed only by their hubris and indifference to those being economically asphyxiated. The top 1% now owns over 40% of global wealth - more than the entire bottom 80% of humanity. A mind-bending statistic that would make the robber barons blush.

These unconscionable levels of inequity destabilize societies by concentrating wealth, power and opportunity into fewer plutocratic hands. It undermines social cohesion and mobility while fueling crime, unrest and conflict. The poorest of the poor see dimming hopes of ever transcending their hardscrabble circumstances absent radical change.

Nowhere are these disparities starker than in the deplorable living conditions found across the developing world. Inadequate access to education, healthcare and upward mobility doom billions to an intergenerational underclass. All while the fattest cats get exponentially fatter by rigging rules and exploiting rapacious capitalism.  

We delude ourselves into thinking this chasm is inevitable, forgetting we shaped these imbalanced socioeconomic structures. Our moral indignation neutered by elite-engineered privilege perpetuating itself ad infinitum. We've institutionalized a perverse Gilded Age on a global scale.

The iconoclastic SDG agenda recognized this emergency, establishing the lofty but vital goal of reducing inequalities as central to ensuring humanity's peaceful coexistence and shared prosperity. Achieving this necessitates redistributive policies for inclusively expanding opportunities and living standards.

This means robustly investing in education, healthcare and decent work for all. Equalizing gaping gender disparities through anti-discrimination laws protecting women's rights. Empowering marginalized groups - racial minorities, migrants, the disabled - with full societal enfranchisement and economic integration. And yes, aggressive taxation of wealth accumulation to fund ambitious social programs.

Ending such grotesque imbalances fostering destabilizing have/have-not divides is humanity's preeminent challenge this century. Audacious action combating inequality is the civil rights struggle of our era, demanding moral conviction overcoming complacency and greed.

Powerful interests bitterly oppose this reckoning, aiming to preserve their privilege by sowing divisive populism and short-circuiting reforms. We cannot let inaction and despair squander this pivotal chance at an equitable rebalancing. The brightest hope for uplifting billions resides in the world community's collective commitment to this existential fight.

The world teeters between a flourishing global Renaissance achieved through shared economic dignity and prosperity...or apocalyptic tensions tearing nations asunder. Choose humanity's commonweal over contemptible avarice. Resounding victory democratizing opportunities awaits those bold enough to rewrite this ignominious injustice blighting the world.
