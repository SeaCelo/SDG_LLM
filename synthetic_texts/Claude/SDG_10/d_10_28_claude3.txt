Inequality within and among countries remains a persistent challenge that undermines progress towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In this report, we analyze the current state of Sustainable Development Goal 10 (SDG 10) – Reduced Inequalities – with a particular emphasis on least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs).

Despite concerted efforts, income inequality continues to rise globally, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic's disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations. LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs face unique challenges in addressing inequality due to their structural vulnerabilities, limited resources, and exposure to external shocks.

In LDCs, poverty remains entrenched, with over 35% of the population living below the international poverty line of $1.90 per day. These countries grapple with limited access to quality education, healthcare, and decent work opportunities, perpetuating intergenerational cycles of poverty and inequality. Furthermore, gender disparities persist, hindering women's economic empowerment and participation in decision-making processes.

SIDS confront distinctive challenges stemming from their remoteness, limited land resources, and vulnerability to climate change impacts. Rising sea levels, intensifying natural disasters, and the loss of biodiversity threaten their economic sectors, such as tourism and fisheries, exacerbating income inequality and undermining sustainable livelihoods.

LLDCs face geographic constraints that hinder their integration into global markets and limit access to essential services. High transportation costs, inadequate infrastructure, and dependence on transit countries impede trade and economic diversification, perpetuating inequalities and hindering progress toward sustainable development.

To address these multifaceted challenges, a comprehensive and coordinated approach is required, involving national governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector. Targeted interventions must prioritize inclusive and sustainable economic growth, addressing structural barriers and promoting equal opportunities for all.

One potential initiative is the establishment of a global fund dedicated to supporting LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs in their efforts to reduce inequalities. This fund could provide resources for capacity-building, infrastructure development, and the promotion of inclusive policies and programs. For instance, it could finance vocational training programs tailored to local labor market needs, empowering marginalized communities and fostering economic empowerment.

Additionally, leveraging digital technologies and innovative financing mechanisms can help bridge the inequality gap. Initiatives such as mobile money platforms and microfinance schemes can increase access to financial services, enabling entrepreneurship and economic inclusion. Furthermore, investing in climate-resilient infrastructure, sustainable agriculture, and renewable energy solutions can create green jobs and foster sustainable livelihoods, particularly in SIDS and LLDCs.

Effective governance and policy coherence are crucial in tackling inequalities. National governments must prioritize inclusive policymaking, ensuring that marginalized groups have a voice in decision-making processes. International cooperation and partnerships are also essential, fostering knowledge-sharing, technology transfer, and coordinated efforts to address global challenges.

It is important to recognize that progress towards SDG 10 is intrinsically linked to other SDGs, such as SDG 1 (No Poverty), SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 5 (Gender Equality), and SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth). Addressing inequalities requires a holistic approach that considers the interconnected nature of these goals and leverages potential synergies.

In conclusion, reducing inequalities within and among countries is a complex and multidimensional challenge that requires sustained efforts and innovative solutions. By prioritizing inclusive policies, fostering economic empowerment, and promoting international cooperation, we can pave the way for a more equitable and sustainable world, leaving no one behind.
