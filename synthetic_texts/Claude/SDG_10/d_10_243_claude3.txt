Here is a detailed academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities), drafted as if written by economist Paul R. Krugman:

Inequality – both within and between nations – poses one of the greatest threats to sustained economic growth and social stability in the 21st century. The 10th Sustainable Development Goal, focused on reducing inequalities, is therefore not just a moral imperative but an economic necessity if we wish to create truly prosperous societies.  

The rise of inequality in recent decades has been staggering. In the United States, the share of national income going to the top 1% has more than doubled since the 1970s. Globally, the combined wealth of the richest 26 billionaires is greater than the total GDP of the poorest 3.7 billion people. These trends are economically unsustainable and politically destabilizing.

There is strong evidence that high inequality acts as a drag on economic growth and productivity. Greater income disparity leads to underinvestment in education, skills, and public infrastructure – key drivers of long-run growth. It fuels economic insecurity, debt overhangs, and populist backlash against growth-enhancing policies. And it concentrates economic power in the hands of rent-seekers who can rig the rules for their own benefit.

Some inequality is inevitable in any market economy that rewards effort and talent. But beyond a certain point, inequality becomes severely dysfunctional. We appear to have crossed that line, which makes reducing inequality not just a moral cause but an economic necessity.

Consider the United States, where for decades an implicit bargain allowed the benefits of economic growth to be widely shared. Rising worker productivity was matched by rising compensation, creating a virtuous circle of increasing demand for goods and services. That virtuous cycle has broken down since the 1970s, as pay for typical workers has stagnated despite strong productivity growth.

The causes of this "great decoupling" are complex and interrelated. The decline of private sector unions has eroded workers' bargaining power. Globalization has placed US workers in direct competition with low-wage labor abroad. New technologies have increased the demand for highly educated "superstars" while devaluing many traditional middle-class jobs. Tax and regulatory policies have favored capital over labor.

Whatever the causes, the effects are clear. For the bottom 90% of Americans, incomes have grown at less than 0.5% per year for the past four decades. At the same time, the pre-tax incomes of the top 1% have nearly quadrupled. This represents a massive income transfer from those who derive their incomefrom labor to those who derive it from capital ownership. It is economically damaging and socially corrosive.

Trends across the developed world tell a similar story. In many nations, the simple bargain that allowed for shared prosperity has been broken. As inequality rises, so too does economic and political instability, strengthening the hand of nativist and populist demagogues peddling falsehoods about immigrants, trade, and global integration.

It doesn't have to be this way. Well-designed policies can reduce inequality while also promoting economic dynamism and growth. Examples include more progressive tax policies; strengthening worker representation and collective bargaining; making higher education and skills training more accessible; investing in social safety nets; creating more affordable housing in supply-constrained cities; and rewriting the rules to reduce monopoly power and rent extraction.

Of course, given my own ideological priors as a Keynesian economist, I have a inherent preference for policies aimed at re-empowering labor and strengthening the middle class. But the core insight – that excessive inequality undermines economic performance and social cohesion – should be embraced across the ideological spectrum.

After all, rising inequality isn't just a concern for the political left. As I've argued, it is a threat to the enlightened self-interest of capitalists and economic elites themselves. Unaddressed, it inevitably leads to ruinous populism, nationalism, and anti-market backlash that historians will view as a periodic recurring "political-economic possibility theorem."

That's why the 10th Sustainable Development Goal – focused on empowering the world's poorest and most vulnerable while addressing the economic divides within and between nations – is so vital. Because in the long run, a growth model built on rampant inequality is neither economically sustainable nor politically stable. Reducing inequality must be a core part of any coherent agenda for inclusive, resilient, and durable economic development.

Those are the economic and moral imperatives behind reducing inequalities, the pivotal SDG that must be addressed if we aim to build truly prosperous societies in this century. While the path will be politically fraught, the alternatives may well be civilizational disaster. The status quo is unsustainable – and we simply must do better.
