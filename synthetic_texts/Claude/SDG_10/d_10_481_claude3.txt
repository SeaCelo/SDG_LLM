Here is a detailed newspaper article about Sustainable Development Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities), written from the perspective of the Los Angeles Times:

A World of Staggering Inequality Lies at Our Doorstep

By Rania Abouzeid, Los Angeles Times Foreign Correspondent

The Hollywood Hills rise like modern pyramids over Los Angeles, monuments to the dizzying wealth concentrated in this metropolis. But just miles from the glamor and excess, thousands of Angelenos sleep on skid row, victims of the same inequality that pervades our city and plagues the world at large.  

Such jarring contrasts are replicated across the globe, from the slums flanking Mumbai's glittering towers to the refugee camps huddled outside of wealthy capitals. Income and wealth disparities, both within and between nations, have reached staggering heights in recent decades. According to the World Inequality Report 2018, the richest 1 percent of the global population captured 27 percent of the world's wealth growth between 1980 and 2016. Meanwhile, the bottom half of humanity saw no increase at all.

These divides don't simply offend our moral sensibilities - they destabilize economies, disrupt societal cohesion, and imperil our planet's ecological balance. That's why the United Nations made reducing inequalities within and among countries an explicit priority when it adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015. 

Goal 10 demands that we dismantle discriminatory policies and legislation to promote inclusion, facilitate safe migration and mobility, and reform global financial and trade systems to boost resilience in developing states and Least Developed Countries (LDCs). It calls for representation and protection of marginalized communities, including racial, ethnic and religious minorities, LGBTQ people, displaced populations, persons with disabilities, and indigenous groups.

"No society can truly flourish and be sustainable when there are such grotesquely skewed distributions of opportunity, power and wealth as we witness today," says Sarah Cliffe, Director of the Center on International Cooperation at New York University. "Deep, persistent inequalities undermine social cohesion, security and shared prosperity."

Cliffe points to declines in civic engagement, social trust, and faith in government as warning signs of fractured societies unraveled by inequality. "These are the fault lines upon which conflict, unrest, and even extremism can take root."

Latin America provides a sobering case study. Despite a commodities boom that brought substantial GDP growth in the 2000s, the region remains among the world's most unequal, partly stemming from its longstanding ethnic and racial hierarchies. The top 10 percent earn around 22 times more than the bottom 10 percent, according to the World Bank. Contrast this with Europe, the world's most egalitarian region, where the top 10 percent earn only around 9.5 times more than those at the bottom.

Excessive gaps in income and wealth are politically destabilizing. Arguably, they fueled the rise of illiberal populists from Hugo Ch√°vez in Venezuela to Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, each capitalizing on the rage of impoverished citizens left behind amid their nations' uneven growth miracles. Central America's Northern Triangle countries - El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras - struggle with corrosive violence spawned in part by their enormous divides. 

In Guatemala, for instance, 10 percent of children suffer from acute malnutrition, while a tiny elite splurges on luxury estates. It's no surprise then that poverty and exclusion drive migrants to make the perilous journey north, foreshadowing the caravans that have overwhelmed U.S. immigration authorities in recent years.

"For too long, inequality has been treated as a mere byproduct of economic policy, rather than a substantive challenge which must be addressed through intelligent, committed policymaking," says Cliffe. "SDG 10 is our chance to change that."

The solutions are hardly simple, spanning fair tax policies, access to education and healthcare, reining in corruption, enforcing worker protections, promoting gender parity, respecting minority rights, and enhancing representation in decision-making. Yet examples from emerging economies demonstrate what's possible when governments prioritize inclusivity.

Take Uruguay, long an egalitarian outlier in unequal Latin America. Its center-left administration launched an ambitious social program in the 2000s, combining targeted cash transfers, expanded healthcare and education, and income tax reforms. As a result, poverty plunged from 32 percent to under 10 percent within a decade, while Uruguay's middle class swelled.  

Or look at Indonesia, which invested heavily in health and education following the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s. The percentage of Indonesians living below the national poverty line was halved between 1999 and 2018. While challenges remain, the Muslim-majority nation has made laudable progress in reducing inequality, according to studies by the World Bank.

For all the economic arguments, environmental preservation provides another powerful impetus for minimizing inequality. After all, it is the planet's poorest citizens who bear the harshest brunt of climate change impacts like rising seas, droughts, famines, and natural disasters - despite contributing relatively little to the greenhouse gas emissions driving global warming.  

Bangladesh faces an existential predicament as warming melts Himalayan glaciers, swelling coastal flooding that could submerge many areas of this low-lying nation by 2050. Such dire scenarios could displace hundreds of millions in the coming decades, overwhelming borders and destabilizing the world order.

"Addressing inequality is not just a moral imperative, it's a pragmatic necessity for the world's collective wellbeing," argues Cliffe. "We cannot claim to be working towards sustainable development while ignoring such a fundamental roadblock."

Whether it's a homeless veteran huddled on skid row, or a farmer in Bangladesh's low-lying deltas, our fates are intertwined in today's globalized reality. Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals means uplifting all of humanity - and reckoning with the systemic inequalities that threaten our shared progress.
