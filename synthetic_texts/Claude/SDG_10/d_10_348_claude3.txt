The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have become a guiding framework for global development efforts, and SDG 10 – Reducing Inequalities Within and Among Countries – is particularly crucial in addressing the persistent and multidimensional challenges of inequality worldwide.

As the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida), we recognize that inequality is not merely an economic issue but a complex, multifaceted phenomenon with profound social, political, and environmental implications. Addressing inequality requires a comprehensive and multidimensional approach that tackles its root causes and manifestations across various domains.

Income inequality, while a significant aspect, is just one facet of the broader issue. Non-income dimensions, such as access to quality education, healthcare, employment opportunities, and basic services, play a critical role in perpetuating or mitigating inequalities. Furthermore, intersectional factors like gender, ethnicity, disability, and geographic location exacerbate existing disparities, creating compounded disadvantages for marginalized groups.

Sida's approach to SDG 10 is grounded in a human rights-based perspective, recognizing that inequality is not only a barrier to sustainable development but also a violation of fundamental human rights and principles of equity and justice. We prioritize interventions that empower and uplift marginalized communities, ensuring their voices are heard and their needs are addressed.

One of our key strategies is promoting inclusive and participatory governance structures that foster transparency, accountability, and equitable representation in decision-making processes. We support initiatives that strengthen civil society organizations, enabling them to advocate for the rights and needs of underrepresented groups effectively. Additionally, we collaborate with national governments to develop and implement policies and legal frameworks that promote equal opportunities and protect against discrimination.

Sida recognizes the crucial role of education in breaking the cycle of inequality. Our interventions focus on increasing access to quality education at all levels, from early childhood development to vocational training and higher education. We prioritize initiatives that address systemic barriers, such as gender disparities, inadequate infrastructure, and lack of resources, to ensure inclusive and equitable educational opportunities.

Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of decent work and economic inclusion as catalysts for reducing inequalities. Our programs support entrepreneurship, skills development, and access to finance for marginalized groups, particularly women and youth. We promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth strategies that create employment opportunities and foster economic empowerment for all.

Addressing inequalities within and among countries is a complex challenge that requires a multidimensional and coordinated approach. Sida leverages its expertise and resources to foster partnerships and collaborations with a wide range of stakeholders, including national governments, civil society organizations, the private sector, and international development agencies. We recognize that tackling inequality is not solely the responsibility of any single entity but requires collective action and shared commitment.

Moreover, Sida acknowledges the intrinsic link between inequality and environmental sustainability. We integrate environmental considerations into our interventions, recognizing that marginalized communities are often disproportionately affected by environmental degradation and climate change. Our initiatives promote sustainable practices, resilience-building, and equitable access to natural resources, ensuring that development efforts do not exacerbate existing inequalities or create new ones.

In conclusion, Sida's approach to SDG 10 is multifaceted, addressing the complex and intersectional nature of inequalities through a combination of policy interventions, capacity-building initiatives, and strategic partnerships. By prioritizing a human rights-based approach, promoting inclusive governance, fostering economic empowerment, and integrating environmental considerations, we strive to create a more equitable and sustainable world for all.
