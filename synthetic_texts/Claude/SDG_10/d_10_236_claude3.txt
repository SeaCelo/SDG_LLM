Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities) as if written by economist Nicholas Bloom:

Inequalities Within and Among Countries: A Threat to Sustainable Development

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has rightly identified rising inequalities as one of the greatest challenges facing the global community. Persistent and widespread inequalities not only imperil social cohesion and societal wellbeing, but act as a fundamental constraint on economic growth and development prospects. While inequality between nations has marginally declined in recent decades, aided by the rapid catch-up growth of China and India, inequalities within countries have reached staggering levels. This trend poses systemic risks and undermines the core principles of the 2030 Agenda to "leave no one behind."

The Scale of Inequalities Within Countries
The statistics lay bare the magnitude of the challenge. In the majority of rich nations and most developing regions, the incomes of the top 10% are running at about 9 times that of the bottom 10%. In the United States, the pre-tax income share of the top 1% has doubled from 10% in 1980 to over 20% today, catapulting the nation into the ranks of one of the most unequal societies globally. Similar patterns are evident across the OECD nations, with the average disposable income of the richest 10% dwarfing that of the poorest by about 9.5 times.  

While high and persistent inequalities have plagued Latin America for decades, the disturbing trend is their meteoric rise in much of Asia and Africa over the past 20 years as countries turned towards market-oriented policy reforms. In India and China for example, despite buoyant growth rates lifting millions out of poverty, consumption inequalities have escalated rapidly, threatening long-term development objectives. It is increasingly clear that growth alone is insufficient to tackle inequalities given the disproportionate accrual of gains to top earners and wealth holders.

The Inefficiency and Injustice of High Inequalities
It was Simon Kuznets who hypothesized that inequality would follow an inverted U-shape as countries develop, first rising with industrialization before declining as a wealthy middle-class emerged. This prediction has been invalidated, with inequalities persisting and even intensifying in advanced economies. Research shows such high levels of inequality are economically inefficient and incompatible with sustainable, inclusive growth.

Inequalities dampen aggregate demand by concentrating resources among top earners with lower marginal propensities to consume. This amplifies business cycles and leads to secular stagnation as firms underinvest due to insufficient demand. High wealth disparities also undermine equality of opportunity and social mobility by entrenching systemic disadvantages for those born into poverty. Children from poor families suffer diminished access to quality education and healthcare, effectively entrenching an inter-generational perpetuation of inequalities. The ramifications are far-reaching, from elevated crime and social unrest to the fuelling of political extremism that threatens the social fabric.  

Policies for Reversing the Inequality Juggernaut  
The tax-and-transfer system has traditionally served as the primary corrective mechanism to address income inequality. Yet, fiscal policy alone is insufficient in the face of powerful market forces driving inequalities higher from skill-based technological change, the globalization of markets for capital and labor, the decline of workers' bargaining power, and regulatory reforms favoring capital over labor.  

More comprehensive policies are needed that foster inclusive growth from the outset, reducing inequalities before government taxes and transfers. Priorities should include investing in affordable quality education and healthcare to level the playing field, strengthening social safety nets to break inter-generational poverty traps, boosting financial inclusion, and promoting competitive markets and efficient regulations that benefit all segments of society. Of critical importance is the judicious use of redistributive tools such as more progressive taxation and policies that empower workers through strengthening collective bargaining rights, raising minimum wages, and improving profit-sharing schemes.

While the specific policy mix will be nationally determined, countries that fail to proactively tackle rising inequalities through such multi-pronged approaches risk inflicting incalculable damage to their long-term economic and social development. The costs of inaction far outweigh those of addressing this monumental policy challenge head-on.  Only by embracing an agenda of shared prosperity aligned with the principles of SDG 10 can we hope to achieve truly sustainable development for both present and future generations.
