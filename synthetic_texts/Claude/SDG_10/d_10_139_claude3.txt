Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities) from the perspective of Polly Toynbee:

Inequality is the greatest blight on our society and the biggest brake on progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals. As a nation, as a continent, as a global community - we will never achieve our potential until we decisively tackle the yawning divides that corrode our shared humanity. The craving to uphold an unjust status quo that privileges the few at the expense of the many is an ugly impulse we must transcend.

The statistics lay bare the scorching injustice that fuels division and despair. The richest 1% have twice as much wealth as 6.9 billion people. A new billionaire is minted every other day while 736 million people live in extreme poverty on unconscionable levels below $1.90 a day. This grotesque inequality represents a scar on the conscience of our civilization. How can we tolerate such misery amidst such opulence and expect social cohesion to prevail?  

Inequality generates grim consequences that immiserate us all. It frays the social fabric, undermining trust in institutions and feeding the virus of alienation that spawns unrest. It subverts meritocracy, denying opportunity to vast reserves of human potential. It warps our economies, distorting distribution and suppressing consumption. Even the wealthy suffer from inequality's discontents as they cravenly erect prisons of privilege to insulate themselves from souring insecurity. 

There are no economic excuses for inequality's persistence in an age of abundance. Redistribution is affordable and regulation can curb rent-extraction by rentiers. The real impediment is the dead hand of ideological dogma that falsely equates flatter distributions with constraining growth. We have ample evidence that more equal societies enjoy higher social mobility, better health and education outcomes, greater innovation, and more sustainable growth. Equality is economic pragmatism.

Promoting inclusion is the ultimate pragmatism because it unlocks the talents of all rather than perpetuating systems that hoard opportunity. We must use muscular interventions to flatten hierarchies of power, wealth, circumstance, and identity. Progressive taxation, worker empowerment, universal public services, democratic economic ownership - these are the levers of a rebalancing that elevates the interests of the broad majority over rent-seeking elites.  

Our interdependence demands institutions robust enough to uplift the wretched of the earth while binding the apex of privilege to the common endeavor. Yet the dead weight of traditionalism paralyzes institutional reform, entrenching outmoded structures that perpetuate inequality between countries and within them.  

The glacial pace of rebalancing global governance to the rising nations of the South perpetuates a profoundly asymmetric world order. A handful of nations accrued historical spoils that entrenched inequality's inheritance for centuries. Updating the inequitable relics of Bretton Woods, reordering finance and trade, empowering developing countries - these are prerequisites for SDG10 to represent more than hollow rhetoric.

Within countries, too, the privileged entrench injustice. Whether the ossified hierarchies of the subcontinent or the insidious marginalizations of deindustrialized towns - the imperative of inclusive institutions holds. Subjugated minorities, trampled workers, abandoned regions - all rot inequality's bitter fruits and fuel its vicious cycles of compounding disadvantage.

We stand at a historical inflection point where muddling complacency invites calamity. The disaffection fueled by inequality now deforms our democracies as atavistic impulses empower demagogues peddling illusory panaceas. Without recalibrating to rebalance the scales of justice, societies risk surrendering to spiraling dysfunction from which recovery grows ever more arduous.

Achieving SDG 10 is not an option but an existential imperative if our world is to cohere. Securing buy-in will require honest brokers laying bare how a rapacious oligarchic agenda subordinating the common good represents collective felo de se. Only an ethos of deep solidarity supplanting cramped self-interest can forge the durable progress craved by the world's dispossessed billions.

This is the moral crucible of our era. History's judgment on our civilization rests upon whether we rise to the occasion. Equality is not an ideological conceit but the supremely pragmatic key to unlocking sustainable development. Consigning want, marginalization, and despair to the Past's brutal roster of  indignities would represent humanity's emancipatory inflection point. Rejecting that immense prize to perpetuate privilege and plutocracy damns us as petty ideologues paving the road to societal perdition. The choice is ours - and it summons our highest aspiration as a species.
