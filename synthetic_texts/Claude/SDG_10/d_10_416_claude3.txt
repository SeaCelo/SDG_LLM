As an organization championing the rights and welfare of older persons globally, HelpAge International recognizes the pivotal role of Sustainable Development Goal 10 (SDG 10) in promoting reduced inequalities within and across countries. Advancing this goal is critical to ensuring that no one, including older populations, is left behind in the pursuit of sustainable development.

The global population is rapidly aging, with projections indicating that by 2050, one in six individuals will be over the age of 65. This demographic shift presents both challenges and opportunities for achieving SDG 10. Older persons often face multidimensional forms of discrimination and marginalization, exacerbated by intersecting factors such as gender, disability, poverty, and social exclusion. These intersectional vulnerabilities can lead to widespread inequalities in access to essential services, employment opportunities, and participation in decision-making processes.

Addressing these inequalities requires a holistic and inclusive approach that recognizes the diverse needs and experiences of older persons. One key initiative could be the establishment of age-friendly cities and communities, which prioritize accessible infrastructure, affordable housing, and inclusive social services tailored to the specific requirements of older adults. Such initiatives not only promote active aging and social inclusion but also contribute to the achievement of other SDGs, such as SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) and SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities).

Furthermore, promoting decent work opportunities for older persons, including through the elimination of age-based discrimination in employment, is critical to reducing economic inequalities. This could involve implementing age-inclusive workplace policies, providing training and reskilling opportunities, and fostering intergenerational knowledge-sharing platforms. By leveraging the valuable experience and skills of older workers, societies can tap into an often-underutilized pool of human capital, contributing to overall economic growth and development.

Ensuring equal access to social protection systems, including pensions and healthcare, is another crucial aspect of reducing inequalities for older persons. Many countries still lack comprehensive and inclusive social protection frameworks, leaving older adults vulnerable to poverty and financial insecurity. Strengthening these systems through sustainable financing mechanisms and targeted interventions can not only improve the well-being of older persons but also contribute to the achievement of SDG 1 (No Poverty) and SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being).

Achieving SDG 10 also necessitates meaningful participation and representation of older persons in decision-making processes at all levels. This could involve establishing dedicated platforms and mechanisms for older persons to voice their concerns, share their experiences, and contribute to the formulation of policies and programs that affect their lives. By involving older persons as active agents of change, societies can foster inclusive and responsive governance structures that promote intergenerational solidarity and social cohesion.

Importantly, the pursuit of SDG 10 must be accompanied by efforts to challenge and dismantle ageist stereotypes and biases that perpetuate discrimination and inequalities against older persons. This could involve launching awareness campaigns, promoting positive narratives about aging, and fostering intergenerational dialogues and interactions that celebrate the diversity and contributions of all age groups.

In conclusion, reducing inequalities for older persons is not only a moral imperative but also a prerequisite for achieving sustainable development in its entirety. By addressing the multifaceted challenges faced by older populations, societies can unlock their immense potential as active contributors to economic, social, and cultural progress. HelpAge International remains committed to advocating for and supporting initiatives that promote the rights, dignity, and well-being of older persons, ensuring that their voices are heard and their needs are met in the pursuit of a more just and equitable world.
