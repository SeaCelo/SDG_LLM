Here is a draft academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities) from the perspective of conservative commentator Dennis Prager:

The Moral Bankruptcy of Leftist Equality Dogma

As we examine the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 10 on reducing inequalities, it becomes glaringly apparent how this agenda is merely a Trojan horse for the left's toxic obsession with enforced egalitarianism. Under the guise of fine-sounding rhetoric about promoting inclusion and equal opportunity, the global elite is pushing an insidious form of secular cultural nihilism that undermines human excellence and democratic capitalism.

At its core, SDG 10 is animated by the left's quasi-religious belief that all disparities and hierarchies are inherently unjust and must be levelled by government coercion and wealth redistribution. This stems from the fatally flawed presumption of a fixed economic pie, where one person's success necessitates another's impoverishment. The reality is that free societies create an ever-expanding pie of prosperity that benefits all socioeconomic strata through voluntary exchange and rewarding productive behavior.  

The pursuit of absolute equality is not only impossible, but profoundly immoral and dehumanizing. It is human nature to be unequal in skills, talents, work ethic, and ambition. Attempting to impose equality of outcome inevitably leads to undermining human distinctiveness, incentivizing sloth over industriousness, and punishing achievement as rapacious "greed." It is a malignant attack on human dignity and personal sovereignty.

The internal contradictions and lack of specificity of SDG 10 lay bare its philosophical and pragmatic incoherence. It decries income and wealth disparities as unacceptable, yet celebrates "diversity" and multicultural differences emanating from varied traditions, values and socioeconomic statuses. How can these two principles possibly be reconciled? The ultimate endpoint of radical egalitarianism is a faceless, homogenized, and bleak monoculture devoid of human vibrancy.

There is also a stunning lack of appreciation for how market economies have lifted billions out of destitute poverty worldwide. The dizzying array of modern commodities and technologies we take for granted were created by profit-driven innovators and entrepreneurs striving for personal gain and reward, not faceless bureaucratic planners obsessed with numerical income parity. Examine the lives of sweatshop workers in developing countries â€“ while difficult by our standards, it represents an exponential improvement from the destitution of subsistence farming or urban squalor that came before.

The animating forces behind SDG 10 have far more to do with cynical power plays, virtue signaling, and disdain for Western Judeo-Christian civilization than any sincere concern for human flourishing. It is part of a broader ideological campaign to erode personal sovereignty, undermine democracy, and centralize power in the hands of unaccountable global governance bodies. We must continue upholding equal rights under the law while fiercely protecting each person's right to the fruits of their own labor, free from external plunder and coercion in the name of a utopian mirage. True justice and prosperity can only be achieved through liberty, not government-imposed equalization.
