Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities) from the perspective of the late economist Walter E. Williams:

Inequality is an inescapable fact of life. There is inequality of talents, skills, temperaments, work habits, and dedication among individuals in any society. Pretending forced artificial equality is possible or desirable represents a dangerous conceit and ignores basic economic realities. The Sustainable Development Goal of reducing inequalities within and between countries is certainly well-intentioned, but like many utopian visions, it is founded on faulty assumptions that defy both human nature and economic principles.

At the most fundamental level, income mobility and income inequality are two sides of the same coin. The prospect of higher future income is a powerful motivator for people to expend effort, practice self-discipline, acquire skills, and take risks. Limiting the top rungs of the income ladder will invariably reduce the determination required to climb it. Forced redistribution always comes with disincentives and unintended consequences that undermine the processes that create wealth in the first place.

When I examine international data on economic freedom indices and actual income mobility, I find that nations with more economic freedom and less government control over private entrepreneurial pursuits exhibit greater income mobility and less persistent income inequality across generations. It's the freest economies, which celebrate and reward individualism rather than attempting to socially engineer egalitarian outcomes, that generate the greatest income growth and opportunity even for the lowest rungs. Thriving market economies produce abundance rather than merely redistributing scarcity.

The unfortunate reality is that most government policies aimed at inequality actually promote it by bestowing favors and subsidies on some groups over others â€“ whether corporations, unions, or racial constituencies. This foments regional and sectoral inequality as resources get misallocated into rent-seeking rather than genuine productivity. Milton Friedman was absolutely right that a society that puts equality before freedom will get neither, but a society that puts freedom before equality will ultimately attain a great measure of both.

Let's also not forget that nations have highly unequal endowments of natural resources, geographic advantages, demographic dividends, and historical legacies that make income parity across borders an utterly unrealistic pipe dream that no level of foreign aid or global governance can equalize. Countries rise and fall economically based on their domestic policies that either empower or repress their populations' entrepreneurial energies. When it comes to income gaps between nations, the only meaningful and ethical way to "reduce inequality" is to export the principles of personal freedom, protection of property rights, rule of law, and free enterprise to the entire world.

In the final analysis, I would argue that the most effective way to respect human diversity while also reducing true destitution and deprivation is to robustly celebrate inequality of efforts and rewards, while ensuring equality of rights and fundamental economic freedoms. It is that potent combination that unlocks human potential and generates widespread prosperity, opportunity and upward mobility. Attacking inequality itself is a harmful diversion that too often becomes a pretext for expanding State control over human action and violating individual liberties. True economic and social progress requires embracing the bottom-up diversity arising from decentralized human choices, not imposing top-down homogeneity from a committee of bureaucrats and intellectual elites.
