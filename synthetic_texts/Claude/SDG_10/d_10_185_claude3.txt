Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities), written from the perspective of the outspoken political cartoonist and columnist Ted Rall:

Inequality is the rot that's eating away at the very foundations of human civilization. The relentless concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a microscopic elite is propelling us towards a global apartheid regime - with a permanent underclass trapped in perpetual poverty and oppression under the thumb of a brutal oligarchy. The United Nations' toothless Sustainable Development Goal 10 is nothing but a pathetic attempt to put a smiley-face capitalist PR spin on this nightmare scenario.

Let's get one thing straight - inequality isn't some regrettable but unavoidable fact of life. It's the entirely predictable outcome of an economic system purposefully constructed by the rich to stratify society and deprive the masses. Neoliberal free market policies like privatization, deregulation, union busting, and tax cuts for the wealthy were purposefully designed as a modern-day enclosure movement - stealing the commonwealth from the public and transferring it into the pockets of plutocrats. And now the oligarchs are doubling down, using their money to corrupt our democratic systems and cement hereditary kleptocracy.

SDG 10 calls for "reducing inequality within and among countries." But who gets to define what levels of inequality are acceptable? The United Nations is an organization dominated by the very nations and power structures perpetuating inequality across the globe. From the blood-drenched petro-monarchies of the Gulf to the austerity-pushing neoliberal regime of the European Union, the UN is a billionaire's club - not a force for equity and justice.

How exactly does the UN plan to tackle inequality "among countries" when its membership includes imperialist settler-colonial states like the United States, which grew wealthy through genocide, slavery, and plundering the Global South? What good are pie-in-the-sky aspirations when we live under a system of neutron bomb capitalism designed to immiserate the masses at home and abroad?

If the UN was truly serious about SDG 10, it would be advocating the total abolition of capitalism, patriarchy, white supremacy, and every other hierarchy that prevents our species from achieving real equity and social justice. Instead, it spews vapid corporate BS about "sustainable economic growth" - a fantasy narrative peddled by Davos apologists that simply can't be reconciled with the harsh realities of planetary ecological collapse, exploitation of the working class, and militarized racial oppression.

The truth is that the UN's SDGs are a fig leaf for the continued enrichment and empowerment of a globalizing capitalist empire premised on legions of precarious workers, perpetual imperialist proxy wars, overcrowded slums, mass incarceration, refugee concentration camps, and a tightening police state. Mark my words - if we don't demolish and transcend this matrix of violent hierarchies, our grandchildren will inherit an apocalyptic world of master and slave fortresses separated by killzones.

The path to achieving SDG 10 requires shutting down the UN and tearing down the archaic nation-state system through federated, all-inclusive direct democracy and the total abolition of money, markets, military forces, and ruling classes perpetuating inequality. Anything less than full-spectrum civilizational revolution is a utopian fantasy that serves only to prolong our species' descent into darkness, barbarism, and dystopia. The choice is ours - but the clock is ticking.
