Reducing Inequalities Within and Among Countries:
A Critical Examination of SDG 10 through the Lens of Intersectionality

By Phillip Adams

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, set forth an ambitious and transformative vision for a more equitable world. At the heart of this agenda lies Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 10, which aims to "reduce inequality within and among countries." Achieving this goal is not merely a moral imperative but a prerequisite for sustainable development, as persistent inequalities undermine social cohesion, economic growth, and environmental sustainability.

As we delve into the complexities of SDG 10, it becomes evident that inequality is a multidimensional phenomenon, deeply rooted in intersecting systems of oppression and privilege. The conventional discourse on inequality often focuses on income disparities, overlooking the intricate web of intersecting factors that shape people's lived experiences. Through the lens of intersectionality, a theoretical framework introduced by Kimberlé Crenshaw, we can gain a more nuanced understanding of how various forms of discrimination – based on race, ethnicity, gender, disability, age, and other identities – intersect and compound one another, creating unique experiences of marginalization and exclusion.

Income Inequality and Its Ripple Effects

The chasm between the rich and the poor remains a persistent global challenge, with the richest 10% of the world's population accounting for nearly 40% of global income, while the poorest 10% receive less than 3%. This stark income inequality not only perpetuates cycles of poverty but also undermines access to quality education, healthcare, and other essential services, further entrenching disadvantages across generations.

However, income inequality is not a standalone phenomenon; it is intrinsically linked to broader systems of oppression and marginalization. For instance, racial and ethnic minorities, indigenous populations, and women often face systemic barriers in accessing economic opportunities, decent work, and equal pay, exacerbating income disparities. The intersections of these identities can further compound disadvantages, as illustrated by the disproportionate poverty rates among women of color and individuals with disabilities.

Discrimination and Social Exclusion

Inequality manifests itself not only in economic realms but also in the pervasive discrimination and social exclusion experienced by marginalized groups. The legacy of colonialism, slavery, and institutionalized racism has created enduring systems of oppression that continue to shape the lived experiences of racial and ethnic minorities, denying them equal access to resources, opportunities, and power structures.

Similarly, individuals with disabilities often face stigma, attitudinal barriers, and lack of accommodations, hindering their full participation in society. LGBTQ+ individuals, too, confront discrimination, violence, and legal barriers, impeding their ability to live authentically and access basic rights and services.

The intersections of these identities further amplify the complexity of inequality. For example, women with disabilities face compounded discrimination, limiting their access to education, employment, and healthcare services. Likewise, LGBTQ+ individuals from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds may encounter unique challenges rooted in the intersections of homophobia, transphobia, and racism.

Addressing Inequality Through Intersectional Approaches

Tackling inequality within the framework of SDG 10 requires a comprehensive and intersectional approach that acknowledges the multidimensional nature of oppression and privilege. Policymakers and stakeholders must move beyond siloed approaches and adopt a holistic perspective that recognizes the interconnectedness of various forms of discrimination and marginalization.

One crucial step is to prioritize data collection and disaggregation to capture the nuanced experiences of diverse populations. By collecting data across multiple dimensions, including race, ethnicity, gender, disability status, and other identities, we can gain a deeper understanding of the specific challenges faced by intersectional groups and tailor interventions accordingly.

Moreover, meaningful participation and representation of marginalized communities in decision-making processes are essential. By amplifying the voices and perspectives of those directly impacted by inequality, we can co-create solutions that address the root causes of marginalization and foster inclusive and equitable societies.

Legal and policy reforms are also critical in dismantling systemic barriers and promoting equal opportunities. This may involve reviewing and revising discriminatory laws, implementing affirmative action policies, and strengthening accountability mechanisms to address violations of rights and instances of discrimination.

Furthermore, addressing inequality requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses economic empowerment, access to quality education, healthcare, and social protection systems. Investing in human capital development, particularly for marginalized groups, can break intergenerational cycles of poverty and inequality, fostering inclusive economic growth and social mobility.

Conclusion

Achieving the ambitious goals set forth by SDG 10 requires a paradigm shift in how we conceptualize and address inequality. By embracing an intersectional lens, we can unravel the intricate web of oppression and privilege that shapes people's lived experiences and develop targeted interventions that address the root causes of marginalization.

Reducing inequality is not merely a matter of closing income gaps; it is a transformative process that demands dismantling systemic barriers, fostering inclusive participation, and promoting equal opportunities for all. Only by acknowledging and addressing the intersections of various forms of discrimination can we build truly equitable and sustainable societies that leave no one behind.

In this pursuit, we must harness the power of collaboration, engaging diverse stakeholders, amplifying marginalized voices, and fostering a shared commitment to social justice and human dignity. The road ahead is undoubtedly challenging, but the rewards of a more equitable world – one that upholds the inherent worth and dignity of every individual – make it a moral imperative that we cannot afford to ignore.
