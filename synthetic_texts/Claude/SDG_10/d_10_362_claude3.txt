As an eminent multilateral development finance institution, the Eurasian Development Bank (EDB) is committed to fostering sustainable economic growth and promoting regional integration across its member states. In this context, the Sustainable Development Goal 10 (SDG 10), which aims to reduce inequalities within and among countries, is of paramount importance to our organization.

Inequality, in its various manifestations, remains a persistent challenge across the Eurasian region. Despite significant progress in poverty reduction and economic development, disparities in income, wealth, and access to opportunities continue to plague our societies. These inequalities not only undermine social cohesion and economic stability but also hinder the region's long-term growth potential.

At the EDB, we recognize that addressing inequality requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses economic, social, and governance dimensions. Our interventions are guided by a comprehensive strategy that leverages our financial resources, technical expertise, and partnerships to promote inclusive growth and equitable development.

One of our key focus areas is fostering economic diversification and supporting the development of non-resource sectors. By encouraging investment in sectors such as manufacturing, services, and agriculture, we aim to create employment opportunities and stimulate economic activity in regions that have historically been dependent on extractive industries. This approach not only enhances resilience against external shocks but also contributes to reducing regional disparities and promoting more balanced growth.

Moreover, we place a strong emphasis on investing in human capital and enhancing access to quality education and healthcare services. Through targeted lending programs and technical assistance initiatives, we support our member states in improving the accessibility, affordability, and quality of education and healthcare, particularly in rural and underserved areas. This investment in human capital not only empowers individuals and communities but also lays the foundation for long-term economic growth and social mobility.

Recognizing the pivotal role of infrastructure in catalyzing economic development and reducing spatial inequalities, the EDB actively supports the development of transportation networks, energy infrastructure, and digital connectivity. By enhancing regional connectivity and facilitating the movement of goods, services, and information, we aim to unlock new economic opportunities and foster greater integration among our member states.

Furthermore, we prioritize the promotion of good governance, institutional strengthening, and regulatory reforms. Through policy dialogue, capacity-building initiatives, and technical assistance programs, we collaborate with our member states to enhance transparency, accountability, and the rule of law. These efforts not only contribute to creating an enabling environment for businesses and investments but also help to address systemic inequalities and ensure that the benefits of economic growth are distributed more equitably.

Complementing our lending operations and technical assistance, the EDB actively engages in research and knowledge dissemination to inform policy decisions and foster dialogue on inequality-related issues. Our analytical work delves into the multidimensional aspects of inequality, examining factors such as gender disparities, rural-urban divides, and the impact of technological change on labor markets. By providing evidence-based insights and fostering policy discourse, we aim to catalyze informed decision-making and drive transformative change.

Recognizing the cross-border nature of inequality and the interconnectedness of our member states, the EDB places a strong emphasis on regional cooperation and knowledge sharing. We facilitate the exchange of best practices, promote joint initiatives, and foster partnerships among our member states, as well as with other international organizations and development partners. This collaborative approach not only leverages collective expertise but also promotes harmonized strategies and coherent policies to tackle inequality effectively.

As we navigate the complexities of the Eurasian region, the EDB remains steadfast in its commitment to reducing inequalities and fostering inclusive and sustainable development. Through our multifaceted interventions, we strive to create an environment where every individual, regardless of their background or circumstances, has the opportunity to thrive and contribute to the region's prosperity.
