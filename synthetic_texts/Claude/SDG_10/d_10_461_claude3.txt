Here is a detailed newspaper article about Sustainable Development Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities) as if written for the publication Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities:

The Gini Coefficient: An Essential Metric for Tracking Reduced Inequalities 

In the financial markets, technical analysts live and breathe charts and indicators to gauge trends and identify potential reversion points. But when it comes to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 10 - Reduced Inequalities, there's one vital indicator that deserves our scrutiny: the Gini coefficient.

For the uninitiated, the Gini coefficient is a statistical measure representing the income or wealth distribution among a population. A value of 0 represents perfect equality, while a coefficient of 1 indicates maximum inequality where one entity has all the income or wealth. It's essentially the markets' way of quantifying economic disparities within and across countries.

Why does reduced inequality matter to the financial sector? Because, as we've seen time and again, prolonged income disparity breeds social unrest, stifles economic growth, disrupts supply chains, and ultimately impedes corporate profitability and market stability.

While the world's collective Gini coefficient has declined modestly over recent decades, inequality remains stubbornly high, with some regions experiencing an alarming divergence. Sub-Saharan Africa's Gini consistently tops 0.5, while the OECD average hovers around 0.32 – still higher than the 0.25-0.27 range many economists deem the inequality "tipping point."

The impacts reverberate across asset classes. In commodity markets, widening chasms between the world's haves and have-nots heighten resource nationalism risks as populations demand a greater share of their countries' extractive wealth. For equity investors, high inequality dampens consumer demand, hindering revenue growth for firms reliant on mass-market consumption.

Even bond markets aren't immune, as high inequality correlates with higher government debt-to-GDP ratios. Why? The populist backlash fosters higher social spending while shrinking the tax base – a combustible formula for fiscal deficits that erode sovereign credit quality.

The UN's SDG framework doesn't merely aspire to humanitarian ideals; it aims to foster the inclusive economic environment that underpins long-term sustainable growth across all sectors and markets.  

Closing yawning inequality gaps won't be easy. It will require overhauling outdated educational models, enacting progressive tax regimes, and incentivizing investment in marginalized communities. But the payoffs could be transformative: unlocking trillions in consumption potential while mitigating systemic risks transcending asset classes.

So as technical analysts, we'd be wise to keep the Gini coefficient in our quivers alongside our RSIs and Fibonacci curves. Because the smoother that indicator's path to zero, the higher the probability of sustained bull markets across the global financial cosmos.
