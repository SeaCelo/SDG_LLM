The Ethical Imperative of Reducing Inequalities Within and Across Nations

By Sylvia Schur, Professor of Sustainable Development, Concordia University

As an academic devoted to the study and advancement of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), I have long been compelled by the moral urgency and transformative potential of SDG 10 – Reducing Inequality Within and Among Countries. This objective strikes at the heart of one of the greatest challenges facing our global society – the pervasive and multidimensional disparities that manifest across lines of income, wealth, opportunity, and intersectional identities.

The ethical foundations underlying SDG 10 are rooted in principles of human dignity, fairness, and the fundamental belief that all people should have equitable access to the basic rights, resources, and prospects for fulfillment that enable them to lead lives of meaning and flourishing. Yet, the harsh realities of our world are characterized by staggering divides, with immense concentrations of privilege and prosperity coexisting alongside widespread deprivation, marginalization, and systemic disadvantages.

The data is sobering: The wealthiest 1% of the global population owns nearly half of the world's wealth, while the bottom 50% collectively holds just 1%. Within nations, this chasm between the haves and have-nots is perpetuated by entrenched cycles of intergenerational poverty, discrimination, and unequal access to quality education, healthcare, and economic opportunities. Across borders, inequalities are exacerbated by factors such as unfair trade practices, exploitative resource extraction, and the disproportionate impacts of climate change on vulnerable communities.

To confront these multifaceted challenges, we must adopt a holistic and multidimensional approach that addresses the intertwined economic, social, political, and environmental determinants of inequality. This necessitates a comprehensive policy framework that encompasses everything from progressive taxation and wealth redistribution mechanisms to robust social safety nets, investment in inclusive public services, and the empowerment of marginalized groups through participatory decision-making processes.

One promising initiative that exemplifies this integrated approach is the Inclusive Prosperity Initiative (IPI), a collaboration between the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and national governments. The IPI seeks to foster more equitable and sustainable economic growth by combining targeted interventions such as skills training, access to finance for underserved entrepreneurs, and the formalization of informal sector workers, with broader policy reforms aimed at strengthening labor protections, expanding social security coverage, and promoting inclusive governance.

A noteworthy example of the IPI's impact can be seen in its work in Namibia, where it has facilitated the creation of over 20,000 new jobs through targeted investments in sectors like sustainable agriculture, renewable energy, and ecotourism. Crucially, these initiatives have been accompanied by policy measures to enhance financial inclusion, improve access to affordable housing, and strengthen social protection programs – all of which contribute to reducing multidimensional poverty and inequality.

Another critical component of addressing SDG 10 is tackling intersectional inequalities rooted in systemic discrimination based on gender, race, ethnicity, disability status, and other marginalized identities. This requires a concerted effort to dismantle structural barriers, challenge harmful social norms and biases, and ensure equal opportunities and protections under the law.

One powerful example of such an initiative is the Huairou Commission's Grassroots Women's Academies, which empower women from underserved urban communities through leadership training, capacity-building, and advocacy support. By equipping these women with the knowledge, skills, and platforms to engage in local decision-making processes, the Academies have enabled them to secure land tenure rights, access basic services, and participate in urban planning and development initiatives – thereby addressing intersecting inequalities based on gender, socioeconomic status, and spatial marginalization.

As we strive to reduce inequalities, it is crucial to recognize the intrinsic interconnections between SDG 10 and other SDGs. Progress in areas such as quality education (SDG 4), decent work and economic growth (SDG 8), and climate action (SDG 13) can directly contribute to mitigating inequalities by expanding opportunities, building resilience, and addressing disproportionate vulnerabilities.

Conversely, failing to address systemic inequalities can undermine progress across multiple SDGs, as marginalized communities often bear the brunt of challenges ranging from poor health outcomes and environmental degradation to lack of access to sustainable energy and infrastructure.

It is this holistic, interdependent nature of the SDGs that underscores the urgency of prioritizing inequality reduction as a central pillar of the sustainable development agenda. By fostering more inclusive, equitable, and just societies, we not only uphold fundamental human rights and ethical imperatives but also lay the foundation for social cohesion, economic dynamism, and environmental resilience – all of which are essential for achieving truly sustainable development.

As we look ahead, our collective commitment to SDG 10 must be unwavering. We must seek to amplify the voices and agency of marginalized communities, forge multi-stakeholder partnerships that leverage the unique strengths and resources of diverse actors, and continuously innovate and adapt our approaches to address the evolving complexities of inequality in a rapidly changing world.

For it is only through a relentless pursuit of equity, shared prosperity, and the realization of human potential for all that we can truly create a world that is sustainable, just, and worthy of the inherent dignity of every human being.
