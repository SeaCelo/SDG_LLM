Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities), written from the perspective of Harold Meyerson:

Inequality has become the defining issue of our era. As economies have grown, wealth has become increasingly concentrated among a privileged few, while the fortunes of working people have stagnated or declined. This trajectory threatens not just traditional notions of economic fairness and equal opportunity, but the very functioning of market economies and liberal democracies themselves. 

The 10th Sustainable Development Goal, focused on reducing inequalities within and among countries, is thus not merely a moral imperative but an economic and political necessity. Unchecked, inequalities breed resentment, unrest, and a rejection of the established order - dynamics we've already witnessed playing out across the developed world in recent years through revolts against neoliberal austerity, surges in nativist populism, and challenges to the postwar liberal consensus.

While much of the focus has been on income and wealth inequalities, these disparities manifest in myriad other ways - unequal access to healthcare, education, housing, and basic public services. Gaps in economic outcomes are exacerbated by disparities rooted in race, gender, disability status, and other demographics. Spatial inequalities, like urban/rural and center/periphery divides, further stratify opportunity and quality of life.

These inequalities don't merely stem from market forces, but are actively produced and reinforced by policy regimes that favor capital over labor, oligopolies over competition, inherited wealth over earned success, and concentrated economic and political power at the apex. Reversing inequality's decades-long rise requires a comprehensive rewriting of the rules to empower workers, reign in rent-seeking behavior, democratize economic decision-making, and rebalance social investments.  

At the global level, the legacy of colonialism, exploitive trade and lending practices, tax evasion facilitated via offshoring, and a rigged system of global governance have systematically enriched the wealthy nations at the expense of the developing world. Redressing these disparities may ultimately require more redistributive measures like debt forgiveness, aid transfers, enforceable labor and environmental standards, and more representative global institutions.  

Tackling inequality is thus fundamentally about power - economic, political, social - and how it is exercised and distributed. The rise of winner-take-all capitalism has coincided with a systematic consolidation of influence among elite corporate interests and a hollowing out of countervailing labor, civic, and popular forces. Reclaiming broadly shared prosperity necessitates rebuilding these countervailing powers and repositioning workers and communities as pivotal stakeholders, not token beneficiaries. This means stronger unions, more robust social safety nets, public options in key goods and services, and more small-d democratic input into economic decision-making.

The challenges are immense, but so are the stakes. If left unaddressed, inequalities threaten not just the social fabric and economic health of our communities, but the legitimacy and durability of democratic governance itself. The 10th SDG represents a charge to reinvent inclusive, sustainable, and equitable economies and societies for the 21st century before existing divides become unbridgeable. It's a daunting task but an existential imperative - the future of shared, broad-based prosperity may depend on it.
