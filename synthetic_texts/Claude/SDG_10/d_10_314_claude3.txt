In this report on Sustainable Development Goal 10 (SDG 10) - "Reduce inequality within and among countries" - we will delve into the challenges, progress, and opportunities in reducing income disparities, expanding access to basic services, and promoting social, economic, and political inclusion for all, regardless of age, gender, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion, economic status, or other conditions.

Inequality remains one of the main obstacles to sustainable development. Despite significant progress in combating extreme poverty over recent decades, large income disparities persist within and between countries. In 2016, the richest 10% of the global population held 52.8% of total global income, while the poorest 50% accounted for only 8.5%. These gaps have continued to grow, showing no clear signs of slowing down, thereby jeopardizing social cohesion and inclusive, sustainable economic growth.

In Chile, despite being classified as a high-income country by the World Bank, significant structural inequalities remain. The Gini coefficient, which measures income inequality, stands at 0.46, one of the highest among OECD countries. Major regional disparities persist, with nearly 50% of the population in multidimensional poverty concentrated in rural areas and vulnerable urban zones. Indigenous peoples, women, migrants, and persons with disabilities face greater barriers in accessing decent jobs, basic services, and equal participation.

Achieving SDG 10 requires a multidimensional and coordinated approach that addresses the root causes of inequality through progressive fiscal policies, investments in quality education and healthcare, the creation of decent jobs, robust social protection, and the promotion of economic, social, and political participation for the most disadvantaged groups. Inspiring examples such as conditional cash transfer programs and affirmative action policies for access to higher education demonstrate that effective progress is possible.

However, it is crucial to go beyond isolated measures and aim for structural transformations that dismantle systems perpetuating exclusion and lack of opportunities. Efforts must be intensified to build more inclusive, cohesive, and resilient societies where no one is left behind. This entails addressing sensitive issues such as the excessive concentration of wealth, discrimination, and the lack of representation of historically marginalized groups in decision-making spaces.

In this endeavor, international cooperation plays a key role. Through the exchange of best practices, technical and financial support, and the creation of multi-stakeholder partnerships, we can promote transformative policies and programs that tackle the multiple dimensions of inequality. Only through concerted and sustained efforts can we overcome this scourge that undermines sustainable human development and peaceful coexistence among peoples and nations.
