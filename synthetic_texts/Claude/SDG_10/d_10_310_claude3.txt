The Sustainable Development Goal 10, which aims to reduce inequality within and among countries, is a complex and multifaceted challenge that requires a comprehensive and nuanced approach. As the Azerbaijan International Development Agency, we recognize the intricate interplay between economic, political, and social factors that contribute to the perpetuation of inequalities at both domestic and global levels.

At the national level, Azerbaijan has made significant strides in reducing income inequality, with the Gini coefficient decreasing from 0.36 in 2010 to 0.28 in 2019. However, this progress has been uneven, with persistent disparities in rural and urban areas, as well as across different regions of the country. The rural population, which constitutes approximately 42% of the total population, continues to face higher rates of poverty and limited access to essential services, such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure.

To address these disparities, our agency has implemented a comprehensive rural development program that focuses on improving agricultural productivity, enhancing access to markets, and investing in rural infrastructure. This includes initiatives such as the provision of subsidized inputs, technical assistance, and microfinance opportunities to smallholder farmers, as well as the construction of rural roads, irrigation systems, and electrification projects.

Furthermore, we have advocated for policies that promote inclusive economic growth and create employment opportunities for marginalized groups, such as women, youth, and persons with disabilities. This includes initiatives to support entrepreneurship, vocational training, and the development of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Additionally, we have collaborated with the private sector to promote inclusive workplace practices and ensure equal opportunities for career advancement and fair remuneration.

At the global level, Azerbaijan has been an active participant in international development cooperation, recognizing the importance of addressing global inequalities and promoting sustainable development for all. Our agency has engaged in various bilateral and multilateral initiatives, contributing to the implementation of SDG 10 through financial assistance, capacity-building programs, and knowledge-sharing initiatives.

One notable example is our participation in the United Nations Peacebuilding Fund, where we have contributed to post-conflict reconstruction efforts in countries affected by armed conflicts. Our interventions have focused on fostering reconciliation, promoting social cohesion, and addressing the root causes of conflict, which often exacerbate inequalities and marginalization.

Furthermore, we have actively supported the implementation of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development, which aims to mobilize domestic and international resources for sustainable development. This includes initiatives to promote fair and progressive taxation systems, combat illicit financial flows, and enhance international cooperation on tax matters.

In addition to financial assistance, our agency has emphasized the importance of knowledge-sharing and capacity-building initiatives. We have hosted regional workshops and training programs that bring together policymakers, experts, and civil society organizations to exchange best practices, discuss challenges, and develop collaborative solutions to address inequalities at the regional and global levels.

One area of particular focus has been the promotion of policy coherence for sustainable development, ensuring that domestic and international policies across various sectors, such as trade, investment, and migration, are aligned with the objectives of reducing inequalities and promoting inclusive growth.

Moreover, we recognize the importance of addressing intersectional inequalities, where multiple forms of discrimination intersect and exacerbate marginalization. Our agency has prioritized interventions that target vulnerable groups, such as women and girls, indigenous communities, and persons with disabilities, ensuring that their voices are heard and their unique needs are addressed.

To enhance our impact, we have fostered strategic partnerships with various stakeholders, including international organizations, civil society organizations, and the private sector. These collaborative efforts have enabled us to leverage diverse expertise, resources, and networks, ultimately amplifying our collective impact in reducing inequalities.

Looking ahead, our agency remains committed to advancing the ambitious agenda of SDG 10. We recognize that addressing inequalities is a long-term endeavor that requires sustained efforts, innovative approaches, and a strong commitment to leaving no one behind. Through continued collaboration, knowledge-sharing, and evidence-based policymaking, we strive to create a more just, equitable, and inclusive world for all.
