The Sustainable Development Goal 10 (SDG 10) – Reduce Inequality Within and Among Countries – is a critical imperative for the global community to confront the entrenched and multifaceted disparities that persist across nations and within societies. The World Bank Economic Review recognizes the inextricable link between addressing inequality and fostering sustainable economic growth, as well as the centrality of this goal to the overarching 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

The stark reality is that income inequality has been on the rise globally, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has disproportionately impacted vulnerable populations and exacerbated pre-existing fault lines. According to the World Bank's estimates, the pandemic has pushed an additional 97 million people into extreme poverty in 2020, undoing significant progress made in poverty reduction over the past two decades. This setback underscores the urgency of prioritizing equitable and inclusive policies that promote shared prosperity and address the root causes of inequality.

Tackling inequality requires a multidimensional approach that goes beyond income disparities and encompasses inequalities in access to education, healthcare, employment opportunities, and political representation. In many developing countries, entrenched social norms and discriminatory practices perpetuate inequalities based on gender, ethnicity, disability, and other factors, undermining human capital development and economic productivity.

One critical aspect of SDG 10 is the promotion of fiscal, wage, and social protection policies that foster greater equality. Progressive taxation systems, coupled with targeted social safety nets and investments in human capital development, can play a pivotal role in redistributing resources and creating a more level playing field. However, these measures must be tailored to local contexts and designed in a fiscally sustainable manner, taking into account the potential trade-offs between equity and efficiency.

Addressing inequality also necessitates concerted efforts to promote decent work and economic inclusion. This entails creating an enabling environment for sustainable enterprises, fostering entrepreneurship and innovation, and promoting labor market policies that facilitate the transition from informal to formal employment. Additionally, enhancing access to financial services, particularly for marginalized groups and rural populations, can empower individuals and households to participate more fully in economic opportunities.

Beyond national-level policies, international cooperation and commitment to equitable global governance are essential for reducing inequalities among countries. This includes reforming the global trading system to create a more level playing field for developing nations, addressing unfair trade practices, and facilitating technology transfer and knowledge-sharing. Moreover, promoting responsible and transparent management of migration flows can harness the potential benefits of migration while mitigating its negative consequences.

Critically, achieving SDG 10 requires addressing the intersectionality of inequalities and recognizing the compounding effects of multiple, overlapping forms of discrimination. For instance, women from ethnic minorities or those living in rural areas often face compounded disadvantages in accessing education, healthcare, and economic opportunities. Targeted interventions that address these intersecting inequalities are essential for fostering truly inclusive and equitable societies.

In conclusion, reducing inequality within and among countries is a multifaceted challenge that demands sustained and coordinated efforts from governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector. By promoting inclusive and equitable policies, fostering economic opportunities for all, and strengthening global cooperation, we can work towards a more just and sustainable world, where no one is left behind.
