Inequality as a Threat Multiplier: Why SDG 10 is the Linchpin of the 2030 Agenda

By Ellie Tesher

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development represents an unprecedented blueprint for global cooperation to improve human and planetary wellbeing. At its core are 17 integrated Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), an ambitious and interdependent roadmap for achieving a more just, rights-based, and sustainable future for all. However, the agenda's overarching vision of "leaving no one behind" hinges critically on SDG 10 - to reduce inequality within and among countries.

Inequality is one of the most pernicious and entrenched obstacles to global progress. It is both a driver and a symptom of multi-dimensional deprivations, constraining human potential, fragmenting societies, fomenting unrest, and degrading environmental integrity. Deep and persistent inequalities manifest across all countries, with the richest 1% capturing twice as much new wealth as the bottom 50% in recent decades. This stark economic divergence is mirrored by growing disparities in health, education, civic engagement, security, and exposure to environmental risks. Marginalized groups like women, racial minorities, indigenous populations, migrants, LGBTQI+ individuals, and those with disabilities face compounded forms of discrimination, bias, and exclusion.

Inequality acts as a threat multiplier, magnifying the cascading consequences of global challenges like climate change, conflict, public health crises, and economic volatility. When a large segment of humanity is denied the resources, opportunities, and capabilities to build resilience, shocks reverberate across communities and borders. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed these pervasive inequalities, with the poorest and most vulnerable groups suffering disproportionate loss of lives and livelihoods.

We must recognize inequality as an existential risk to our collective aspirations for a sustainable, peaceful, and prosperous world. SDG 10 aims to "reduce inequality within and among countries" by progressively achieving greater equality through fiscal, wage, and social protection policies; promoting inclusion across economic, social, and political dimensions; adopting special measures to empower marginalized groups; facilitating orderly and safe migration; and ensuring equal opportunity and reducing disparities of outcome.

Critically, SDG 10 should not be construed narrowly as an isolated objective for socioeconomic parity. Rather, reducing inequality is the throughline for catalyzing achievement across the entire 2030 Agenda. Greater equity is both an outcome and an enabler of progress on ending poverty (SDG 1), eliminating hunger (SDG 2), achieving quality education (SDG 4), promoting decent work (SDG 8), reducing environmental degradation (SDGs 12-15), ensuring access to justice (SDG 16), and nurturing peaceful societies (SDG 16).  

At its core, sustainable development demands a transformative and multi-pronged approach to tackling systemic disadvantages and discriminatory practices, empowering all members of society to reach their full potential. No longer can we countenance moral, practical, and economic deficits of relegating entire segments of humanity to the margins. Disruptive innovations in legal frameworks, social norms, economic policies, and governance models are imperative to transcend historical injustices and dismantle structural barriers. A human rights-based, intersectional lens is crucial for diagnosing root causes of deprivation and disadvantage, while fostering more inclusive and equitable institutions at all levels.

Only by resolving inequality's paradox - where disadvantage begets further disadvantage in an accelerating vicious cycle - can we hope to achieve the far-reaching targets enshrined in the SDGs. Rising inequality both reflects deeper fissures in our hyper-globalized world and acts as an impediment to bridging divides and forging common cause. By confronting disparities head-on through SDG 10, we can unlock progress across the entire sustainable development agenda while reinforcing the notion that our fates as humanity are profoundly interconnected. Embracing the imperative of equality is the first step toward building more cohesive, resilient, just and sustainable societies poised to flourish in the 21st century and beyond.
