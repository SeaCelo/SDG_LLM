Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities) from the perspective of Mike Barnicle:

Inequality is the great scourge of our time - a malignant force that eats away at the fabric of society and denies human beings across the globe their fundamental rights and dignities. The 10th Sustainable Development Goal represents our call to action, a moral imperative to combat the systemic disparities that divide the world into realms of privilege and deprivation. 

At its core, inequality is an affront to the ideals upon which the United Nations was founded - a violation of the inviolable principles of universal human rights and human dignity. How can we proclaim to uphold these sacred values when millions languish in abject poverty, denied access to education, healthcare, and the basic resources required for sustainable livelihoods? When ethnic and racial minorities face pervasive discrimination and marginalization? When a small cabal of wealthy elites hoards an obscene concentration of the world's resources?

The statistics are nothing short of damning. The 26 richest individuals possess as much wealth as the poorest 50% of humanity. Over 700 million people subsist in conditions of extreme poverty. Income inequality within countries has risen by 11% globally. The chasm between the global 1% and the remaining 99% only continues to widen at an unconscionable rate.

But inequality wreaks damage that extends far beyond mere economic deprivation. It is a sociological disease that warps the social and political fabric, fueling instability, conflict, and a crisis of institutional legitimacy. Where inequality festers, disillusionment and extremism inevitably take root. We have borne witness to the consequences across the world - the fraying of democracy, surges of hate and tribalism, escalations in crime and social unrest.

The solution? An unwavering commitment to the ideals of SDG 10 - promoting inclusion, ensuring equal opportunity, empowering marginalized groups, and enacting progressive policies to reduce disparities in wealth, income, and access to vital resources and services. At the national level, this means strengthening social safety nets, bolstering labor rights and protections, aggressively combating discrimination, and restructuring fiscal policies to facilitate a more equitable distribution of economic productivity.  

On the global stage, fulfilling SDG 10 will require targeted development assistance, equitable trade and lending policies, enhanced representation for developing nations in global governance, and a wholesale reimagining of the international financial architecture. The unchecked accumulation of wealth and retention of archaic economic models is fundamentally incompatible with sustainable progress.

The path will not be easy. Entrenched power seldom relinquishes its privileges willingly. We will face intransigent opposition from vested interests, nationalistic rhetoric, and those blinded by greed and prejudice. But the moral call, as [President] Kennedy articulated, is for all people to be "unmoved by pride of office or insultâ€¦". We cannot allow short-term profits or xenophobic hysteria to obstruct the imperative of human solidarity and our inexorable march toward a more just, equitable world order.

In this great undertaking, we find inspiration in the incandescent words of Revelation - that one day, all "tribes and peoples and tongues" shall attain equal dignity, free from the yoke of oppression and the shackles of indignity. Let those of us in the global community of socially conscious citizens pick up that torch, confident that the wretched existence of inequality cannot endure in the face of our righteous perseverance. The 10th Sustainable Development Goal represents not just a policy roadmap, but a categorical moral imperative - a solemn pledge that no human soul shall be forsaken to destitution and injustice.  If not us to achieve this noble vision, then who? And if not now to eradicate the scourge of inequality once and for all, then when?
