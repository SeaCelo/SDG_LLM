The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) is committed to addressing the critical issue of reduced inequalities, as outlined in Sustainable Development Goal 10. Despite substantial progress in recent decades, deep disparities persist within and among countries, hampering sustainable economic growth, social cohesion, and overall human well-being.

Income inequality remains a pressing challenge, with the richest 10% of the global population earning 40% of total income while the poorest 10% earn only between 2% and 7%. These disparities are often exacerbated by intersecting factors such as gender, ethnicity, disability, and geographic location. For instance, in many developing nations, women and girls face significant barriers to education, employment, and asset ownership, perpetuating cycles of poverty and marginalization.

Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has deepened existing inequalities, disproportionately impacting vulnerable populations and reversing hard-won gains in poverty reduction. According to estimates, the crisis has pushed an additional 119 to 124 million people into extreme poverty in 2020, primarily in countries with already high poverty rates.

Addressing these disparities requires a multi-pronged approach that tackles systemic barriers and empowers marginalized communities. The SDC is actively supporting initiatives that promote inclusive economic growth, such as the Decent Employment for Youth program in Tunisia. This initiative provides vocational training, entrepreneurship opportunities, and access to finance for young people, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds. By equipping youth with skills and resources, we aim to create pathways to decent work and reduce inequalities in economic participation.

Additionally, the SDC recognizes the importance of fostering social inclusion and empowering marginalized groups. In Bangladesh, we are collaborating with local organizations to implement the Disability Inclusive Development program, which promotes the rights and participation of persons with disabilities. This initiative includes accessible infrastructure projects, inclusive education initiatives, and advocacy efforts to challenge stigma and discrimination.

To address inequalities effectively, we must also confront systemic barriers and discriminatory policies and practices. The SDC supports efforts to strengthen legal frameworks, promote participatory governance, and enhance transparency and accountability mechanisms. For instance, in Mozambique, we are collaborating with civil society organizations and government institutions to improve land tenure security for smallholder farmers, many of whom are women and members of indigenous communities.

It is crucial to recognize that the Sustainable Development Goals are interconnected, and progress in one area can catalyze positive change in others. By reducing inequalities and fostering inclusive societies, we can simultaneously advance goals related to poverty eradication, gender equality, decent work, and sustainable economic growth. Conversely, failure to address inequalities can undermine progress across multiple SDGs and perpetuate cycles of marginalization and deprivation.

Moving forward, the SDC remains committed to promoting equality of opportunity, empowering marginalized communities, and addressing systemic barriers to inclusion. We will continue to collaborate with partner countries, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders to develop innovative and context-specific solutions that leave no one behind. By prioritizing inclusive and equitable development, we can build resilient and prosperous societies that uphold the dignity and human rights of all individuals.
