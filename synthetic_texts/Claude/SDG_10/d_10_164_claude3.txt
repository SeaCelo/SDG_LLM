Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities) in the voice of advice columnist Carolyn Hax:

Inequalities have plagued human civilization since the dawn of societies. Whether it's the haves lording their riches over the have-nots, or discrimination based on race, gender, ability or other immutable characteristics - far too many people face unfair disadvantages through no fault of their own. It's a systemic issue that has carried through generations and it needs our concerted effort to dismantle these injustices.

The 10th Sustainable Development Goal laid out by the United Nations aims to "reduce inequality within and among countries." It's an admirable and sorely needed mission, but one that will require committed, sweeping changes across all levels - from individuals, to communities, to national policies and international cooperation.  

On an individual level, we all need to examine our own conscious and unconscious biases. Do we make assumptions about others based on their appearance, accent or background? Do we treat service workers, neighbors in a less affluent area, or the cashier at the grocery store with the same dignity we would a CEO? It's human nature to categorize, but we have to push past that inclination and see every person's equal humanity.  

Within our communities, are there lasting impacts of redlining, environmental injustices, or disparities in school funding that disadvantage certain populations? Local leaders and engaged citizens need to identify and rectify these inequities. Look at representation on boards, public committees, civic organizations - are all voices being heard? If not, make changes to be inclusive.

On a broader scale, policies and practices around wages, workplace discrimination, housing, criminal justice, healthcare access and more all have profound impacts on equity and potential to unlevel playing fields. We need courageous leaders at state and national levels willing to make bold, sustained efforts to create fair systems for all. Updating antiquated laws, properly funding social support programs, diversifying leadership and decision-making bodies - these are imperative.  

And perhaps most critically, countries must collaborate globally to facilitate development and economic opportunities worldwide. Immigration policies, climate change impacts, trade agreements, debt burdens, violent conflicts - these issues transcend borders. By working cooperatively as a united human family, affluent nations can empower developing countries and set the entire world on a more equitable path.

I know it seems like an idealistic dream to solve all the biases, institutional barriers and geopolitics that drive inequality. But we have to try, steadfastly. Because at our core, every parent wants their child to have a fair chance at happiness, security and fulfillment - regardless of skin color, zip code, disability status or nation of origin. It's the greatest gift and responsibility we have - creating a more just world. It will take persistent, radical effort from all levels of society, but achieving that vision of equity is the most meaningful legacy we could possibly leave.
