The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) is committed to advancing the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 10 (SDG 10) – Reduced Inequalities – through its mandate of promoting foreign direct investment (FDI) in developing countries. As a member of the World Bank Group, MIGA recognizes the pivotal role of FDI in catalyzing sustainable economic growth, creating employment opportunities, and fostering technological transfer, all of which contribute to reducing inequalities within and among countries.

In recent years, MIGA has intensified its efforts to facilitate FDI flows into sectors and regions that have traditionally been overlooked or underserved. This strategic approach aims to address the systemic barriers that perpetuate inequalities, such as limited access to finance, inadequate infrastructure, and lack of capacity building initiatives. By prioritizing investments in these areas, MIGA seeks to promote inclusive economic development, empower marginalized communities, and bridge socioeconomic divides.

One of MIGA's key initiatives is the Conflict-Affected and Fragile Economies Facility (CAFEF), which provides political risk insurance to investors operating in fragile and conflict-affected states. By mitigating the perceived risks associated with these challenging environments, CAFEF has successfully mobilized FDI into regions plagued by instability, conflict, and socioeconomic disparities. This influx of investment has catalyzed job creation, infrastructure development, and economic opportunities, ultimately contributing to the reduction of inequalities within these nations.

Furthermore, MIGA has intensified its collaboration with other international financial institutions and development partners to leverage complementary resources and expertise. This collaborative approach has resulted in the development of innovative financing mechanisms and risk-sharing arrangements, enabling MIGA to support larger-scale projects with transformative potential for reducing inequalities. For instance, MIGA has partnered with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Private Infrastructure Development Group (PIDG) to facilitate investments in critical infrastructure projects, such as power generation, transportation networks, and telecommunications, in underserved regions. These initiatives not only foster economic integration but also enhance access to essential services, creating a ripple effect that improves living standards and reduces disparities.

MIGA's commitment to SDG 10 is also reflected in its emphasis on promoting investments that foster gender equality and women's economic empowerment. Through its Gender Entrepreneurship Markets (GEM) initiative, MIGA supports projects that enhance women's access to finance, provide training and capacity-building opportunities, and promote gender-inclusive business practices. By addressing the systemic barriers that historically hindered women's participation in economic activities, MIGA aims to unlock the untapped potential of women entrepreneurs, thereby contributing to the reduction of gender-based inequalities.

Moreover, MIGA recognizes the importance of environmental sustainability in achieving lasting poverty reduction and reduced inequalities. As such, MIGA has taken a proactive stance in supporting investments in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and climate-resilient infrastructure projects. By facilitating the transition towards a low-carbon economy, MIGA not only contributes to mitigating the adverse impacts of climate change but also creates new economic opportunities, particularly in rural and marginalized communities that are disproportionately affected by environmental degradation.

To further amplify its impact, MIGA actively engages with host governments, civil society organizations, and local communities to ensure that its supported projects align with national development priorities and address local needs. Through stakeholder consultations, environmental and social impact assessments, and robust monitoring mechanisms, MIGA strives to mitigate potential adverse impacts and maximize the positive spillover effects of its investments on reducing inequalities.

Looking ahead, MIGA remains steadfast in its commitment to SDG 10, recognizing the intrinsic link between reduced inequalities and sustainable economic growth. By leveraging its unique role as a political risk insurer and its strategic partnerships, MIGA will continue to catalyze transformative investments that foster inclusive development, create economic opportunities, and promote social and environmental sustainability. Through its innovative approaches and unwavering dedication, MIGA aims to contribute to the creation of a more equitable and prosperous global landscape, where no one is left behind.
