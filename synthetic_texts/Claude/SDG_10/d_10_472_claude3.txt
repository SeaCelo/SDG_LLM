Here is a detailed newspaper article on Sustainable Development Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities) as if written by Fortune magazine:

A Tale of Two Worlds: Bridging the Great Divide on Inequality

By Fortune Staff

It's the best of times and the worst of times when it comes to equality and inclusion on a global scale. The world is more prosperous and connected than ever before, yet staggering levels of inequality persist between and within countries. As the UN's 2030 Agenda lays out an ambitious roadmap for tackling society's greatest ills, few challenges loom as large as Sustainable Development Goal 10 – to reduce inequalities and ensure equal opportunity.

The hard data paints a sobering picture. The world's 26 richest individuals own the same wealth as the poorest half of humanity. Income inequality is increasing, with the richest 10% earning up to 40% of total income globally. Developing countries struggle to make economic gains as an estimated $7 trillion in personal wealth is stashed in offshore tax havens. And discrimination against women, minorities, and other vulnerable groups remains pervasive, barring billions from access to jobs, resources, and basic human rights.

"Inequality is the defining issue of our time," argues Winnie Byanyima, executive director of Oxfam International. "It's outrageous that a handful of rich people continue to get richer, while more than 700 million people are trapped in extreme poverty." She cites a rigged economy that favors the privileged, weak governance, and the fallout from COVID-19 as exacerbating divides.

But business has a central role to play in narrowing these gaps. At the vanguard are pioneering companies embracing stakeholder capitalism – elevating societal and environmental impacts beyond pure profit motives. Initiatives like the UN Global Compact are mobilizing a massive coalition of corporations to uphold universal principles on human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption.

For Hubert Joly, former CEO of Best Buy, the shift toward more equal, inclusive, and ethical business models is both a moral and strategic imperative: "If you share wealth more broadly, you create more economic growth and more demand for products and services. You create more political stability. You create an ecosystem for your enterprise to thrive."

Joly points to the electronics retailer's success in taking a stand on LGBTQ rights, environmental sustainability, and paying reasonable wages above the minimum. "Big public companies used to ask, 'what's in it for me?' Now it's more like, 'what can we do for our multiple stakeholders that is aligned with creating societal value?'"

Reducing inequality is inseparable from promoting diversity and inclusion at all levels. For companies like Sodexo, a global leader in foodservice and facilities management, this spurs innovation, enhances environmental and social performance, and better connects with diverse customers and local communities. The company has implemented quantifiable goals around gender balance, Pay Equity Studies, programs for people with disabilities, LGBTQ networks, and other D&I initiatives.

"Businesses have to put themselves in their customers', clients', and employees' shoes," says Rohini Anand, Sodexo's Global Chief Diversity & Corporate Responsibility Officer. "We operate in 64 countries around the world. If we don't reflect the diversity of the markets and communities we serve, how can we be relevant and competitive?"

Fair labor practices are another linchpin. Too often, companies turn a blind eye to exploitative work environments and pay gaps across their operations and supply chains. But businesses taking the high road are prospering by upholding labor standards, empowering workers through collective bargaining, and supporting a living wage for all employees.

"Income inequality starts with waged work, with those at the bottom not earning enough to work their way out of poverty," notes Kilian Moote, project director of KnowTheChain, which benchmarks corporate human rights policies. "Companies committed to sustainability need to prioritize lifting up those most vulnerable in their supply chains."

The tide is shifting, even for corporations dependent on global supply networks. After facing scrutiny over poor working conditions at suppliers, Nike overhauled its approach to focus on investing in workers, advancing women, and clean manufacturing. And pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk anchors its business on promoting better health for vulnerable populations worldwide.

For all the progress, challenges abound in converting lofty promises into tangible change. Pushback against "woke capitalism" is intensifying as some politicians and critics accuse corporations of pushing divisive social agendas at the expense of business fundamentals. The UN itself faces headwinds from nationalism, populism, and great power rivalries that could hamper collective action on the SDGs.

Cynicism aside, achieving SDG 10 is both an ethical obligation and a strategic opportunity for corporations willing to step up on equality and inclusive growth. In today's divided world, companies can either be part of the problem by perpetuating inequalities – or part of the sustainable solution.
