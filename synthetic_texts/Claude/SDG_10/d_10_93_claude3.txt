Here is a detailed, comprehensive academic article on SDG 10 - Reduced Inequalities, written from the perspective of the renowned Indian journalist and author Rajdeep Sardesai:

Inequality has been one of the most pernicious and intractable challenges facing humanity for centuries. As India strives to lift millions out of poverty and deprivation, tackling this deep-rooted disparity must be at the core of our national agenda. The 10th Sustainable Development Goal of the United Nations, which aims to "reduce inequality within and among countries," provides a critical framework to address this issue head-on.

India's tryst with economic liberalization in the early 1990s ushered in an era of breakneck growth. GDP numbers soared, a burgeoning middle class emerged, and India's influence on the global stage surged. However, this narrative of prosperity has been marred by the persistent underbelly of inequity. The gap between the privileged and the have-nots has only widened, exacerbated by structural inequalities, social stratification, and deeply entrenched biases.

The manifestations of this chasm are stark and pervasive. Access to quality education, healthcare, and economic opportunities remain a chimera for vast swathes of our population, perpetuating intergenerational cycles of deprivation. Women, minorities, and marginalized communities continue to face systemic discrimination, undermining their fundamental rights and curtailing their potential. Regional disparities too have lingered, with some states and districts lagging behind in crucial human development indices.

Addressing these multidimensional inequalities is not just an ethical imperative; it is a strategic necessity for India's long-term growth and stability. A nation where a significant portion of its citizenry is excluded from the mainstream can never truly unlock its full potential. Inequality breeds disillusionment, fuels social unrest, and impedes the nation's progress.

The SDG 10 framework offers a comprehensive roadmap to confront this challenge. It calls for adopting fiscal, wage, and social protection policies that progressively achieve greater equality. It emphasizes the empowerment and promotion of social, economic, and political inclusion of all, irrespective of age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion, or economic or other status.

Critically, SDG 10 also underscores the need for enhanced representation and voice for developing countries in decision-making in global international economic and financial institutions. This is particularly pertinent in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has laid bare the stark global inequalities in access to healthcare, vaccines, and economic resilience.

For India to truly embrace the spirit of SDG 10, we must undertake a multi-pronged approach. Firstly, we need to overhaul our education system to ensure equitable access to quality learning opportunities for all children, regardless of their socioeconomic backgrounds. Investing in early childhood education, addressing the digital divide, and revamping curricula to promote critical thinking and skill-building are imperative.

Secondly, we must prioritize universal healthcare coverage, ensuring that no Indian is denied access to affordable and quality medical services due to financial constraints. This entails not only augmenting public health infrastructure but also addressing the social determinants of health, such as nutrition, sanitation, and preventive care.

Thirdly, we must actively promote economic inclusion by fostering entrepreneurship, providing access to finance, and creating robust social safety nets. Initiatives like the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) have been laudable, but we need to expand and strengthen such programs to create sustainable livelihoods.

Fourthly, we must confront the deep-rooted biases and discrimination that permeate our society. This requires not just legal reforms but also concerted efforts to change mindsets and challenge regressive social norms. Affirmative action policies, while contentious, remain crucial tools to level the playing field and ensure adequate representation for marginalized groups.

Lastly, we must leverage technology as an enabler of equity. Digital platforms can democratize access to information, services, and economic opportunities, empowering even the most remote and disadvantaged communities.

Ultimately, reducing inequality is not just about wealth redistribution; it is about fostering an inclusive society where every Indian has an equal opportunity to realize their full potential. It is about nurturing a vibrant, cohesive nation where diversity is celebrated, and no one is left behind.

As India aspires to emerge as a global economic powerhouse, we cannot afford to ignore this imperative. Our pursuit of progress must be anchored in the principles of justice, equity, and human dignity. Only then can we truly claim to be a nation that upholds the ideals enshrined in our Constitution and contributes meaningfully to the global goals of sustainable development.
