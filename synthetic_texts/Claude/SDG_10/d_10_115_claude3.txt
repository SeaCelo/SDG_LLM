Terence Blacker's Perspective on SDG 10: A Scathing Critique of Inequality

The great social philosopher Terence Blacker was never one to mince words when it came to the insidious forces of inequality that continue to plague our world. With his signature blend of sardonic wit and penetrating intellect, he would have surely skewered the lofty ambitions of the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 10 – reducing inequalities within and among countries.  

"Reduced inequalities?" he might have scoffed. "A noble aim, to be sure, but one that the international community seems constitutionally incapable of achieving. We live in an age of yawning chasms, not merely between the global North and South, but within the fabric of nearly every nation on Earth."

Blacker would likely have training his acerbic prose on the fundamental discord at the heart of SDG 10 – the jarring contradiction between its stated objectives and the prevailing neoliberal economic orthodoxy that has turbocharged inequality over the past half-century. How can we achieve "income growth of the bottom 40% of the population at a rate higher than the national average," he might demand, when dogmas of austerity, privatization and deregulation relentlessly siphon wealth to the top?

With Swiftian flair, Blacker could have caricatured the international community's feckless efforts to legislate away inequality through piecemeal policies and toothless accords. "Adopt fiscal and wage policies? Facilitate migration? Why not simply implore the rich to share their ill-gotten gains?" This from a man whose words laid bare the false premises and mythologies underpinning such gestures.

Yet Blacker was no idle cynic. His critiques carried moral urgency precisely because they illuminated genuine paths forward – away from the nostrums of trickle-down economics and toward a more equitable distribution of resources and political power. He might have pointed to the modern resurgence of progressive wealth taxes, universal basic income proposals, and employee-ownership models as glimmers of an emerging paradigm more aligned with SDG 10's professed values.

Ultimately, though, the most biting indictment of SDG 10 in the Blackerian spirit might be that it exists at all – that such a nakedly reformist objective is still considered audacious in 2023. For a thinker who dreamed of more thoroughgoing transformations in economic and political structures, the call to incrementally "reduce inequalities" could only be an embittered admission of our cramped ambitions and cowed imagination in confronting one of humanity's most entrenched injustices.

As an unsparing observer of social reality, Blacker knew that the true path to equality could never be paved by technocratic tinkering or gestural targets – but only through a fundamental reordering of power that he spent his life advocating. His voice may be gone, but the moral urgency of that struggle echoes through the annals of history, and SDG 10, for all its good intentions, stands as just one more testament to how far we have yet to go.
