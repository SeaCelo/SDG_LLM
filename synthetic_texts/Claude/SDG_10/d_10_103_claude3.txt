Addressing Inequality within and across Nations: A Multidimensional Approach to Achieving SDG 10

By Irfan Husain

The pursuit of reducing inequalities, both within nations and among countries, has long been a daunting challenge for policymakers and development experts alike. Sustainable Development Goal 10 (SDG 10) aims to tackle this complex issue head-on, recognizing that inequality is a multifaceted phenomenon that manifests in various forms, from income disparities to unequal access to resources and opportunities.

At its core, SDG 10 seeks to empower and promote the social, economic, and political inclusion of all, irrespective of age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion, or economic or other status. This ambitious goal acknowledges that inequality is not merely an economic issue but a deeply ingrained societal challenge that requires a holistic and multidimensional approach.

One of the key targets of SDG 10 is to progressively achieve and sustain income growth for the bottom 40 percent of the population at a rate higher than the national average. This target recognizes that income inequality is a significant driver of social and economic instability, and that addressing it requires targeted policies and interventions aimed at uplifting the most vulnerable and marginalized segments of society.

However, income inequality is merely the tip of the iceberg. SDG 10 also addresses the disparities in access to basic services, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure, which are often exacerbated by socio-economic factors. Ensuring equal opportunities and promoting inclusive policies in these domains is crucial for breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty and inequality.

Moreover, SDG 10 acknowledges the importance of fostering a more equitable global order by advocating for the fair treatment of migrant workers, facilitating safe and orderly migration, and promoting the representation and voice of developing countries in global decision-making processes. This recognition underscores the interconnectedness of inequality across borders and the need for international cooperation and solidarity in addressing these challenges.

Achieving SDG 10 requires a multifaceted approach that combines targeted interventions, policy reforms, and a fundamental shift in societal attitudes and norms. Fiscal policies, such as progressive taxation and targeted social protection programs, can play a crucial role in redistributing wealth and providing a safety net for the most vulnerable. However, these measures must be complemented by efforts to promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, create decent work opportunities, and invest in human capital development.

Furthermore, addressing inequality requires a concerted effort to tackle systemic discrimination and promote social inclusion. This involves dismantling structural barriers, challenging entrenched biases, and empowering marginalized communities to participate fully in social, economic, and political spheres. Effective governance, accountability mechanisms, and the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms are essential in this regard.

Ultimately, achieving SDG 10 is not just a matter of economic or policy interventions; it is a moral imperative that demands a fundamental rethinking of our societal values and priorities. It calls for a renewed commitment to upholding the principles of human dignity, equality, and justice, and a recognition that a more equitable world is not only a moral imperative but also a prerequisite for sustainable development, social cohesion, and lasting peace.
