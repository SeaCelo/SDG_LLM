Here is a draft newspaper article about Sustainable Development Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities) as if written for Forbes:

The Moral and Economic Imperative of Tackling Inequality

By the Forbes Editorial Board

It's an uncomfortable truth that society has long turned a blind eye towards: inequality is not just corrosive to social cohesion, but an existential threat to long-term economic prosperity. Yet far too many business leaders still treat reducing inequalities as a mere box to tick for corporate social responsibility rather than a prerequisite for sustainable growth.

The 10th Sustainable Development Goal, Reduced Inequalities, calls on nations to progressively achieve and sustain income growth for the bottom 40% of the population at a rate higher than the national average. This is not about wealth redistribution but cultivating a vibrant middle class as a driver of innovation and economic dynamism.

Study after study shows that high levels of inequality stifle upward mobility and depress opportunities for the poor to lift themselves out of poverty. This forgone human potential is an unnecessary drag on economic progress. A lack of equitable access to quality education, healthcare, and finance perpetuates cycles of deprivation that prevent entire segments of society from reaching their productive capacities.

But beyond the moral arguments, there is a powerful business case for prioritizing a more equal society. A larger middle class translates into a larger consumer base able to afford products and services. More economic security incentivizes entrepreneurship and risk-taking, unleashing the human ingenuity that drives innovation. Political and social stability, facilitated by reduced inequalities, creates a more conducive climate for long-term investment and growth. 

Those still skeptical need only look at regions of the world with severe inequality as a cautionary tale. Latin America's Gini coefficient – the economic measure of inequality– consistently ranks among the highest globally. Despite plentiful natural resources, intraregional trade, and pockets of affluence, the region's extreme inequality has fueled social unrest, institutionalized corruption, and "brain drain" that have capped its economic potential.

On the other hand, the Asian economic "tigers" like Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan can attribute much of their meteoric development to policies that nurtured an urban middle class with access to education and opportunities. With economic mobility came social stability and incentives for innovation that cemented their ascent.

Reducing inequalities does not happen passively – it requires intentional policy action and a shift in business mindsets. Tax and spending policies, collective bargaining rights, and investments in underserved communities play a vital role. So too does ruthlessly rooting out discrimination and ensuring equity in lending, employment, and entrepreneurial ecosystems.

Progressive corporate leaders have already embraced stakeholder capitalism as the new model for long-term value creation. Now it is time to treat inequality not as a niche concern but as a core priority inextricably linked to sustainable commercial success. As we forge into an era of immense economic and social disruption, building a more equitable society is both moral and strategic imperative to unlock broad-based prosperity.

It is not an easy path – far from it. The forces of technological change and market consolidation have been exacerbating inequalities even in advance nations. But choosing to ignore this existential challenge would be a historic miscalculation. The future prosperity of enterprises, industries, and national economies depends on whether today's leaders muster the courage to make the difficult policy choices and investments to create more Reduced Inequalities. The cost of inaction is simply too high.
