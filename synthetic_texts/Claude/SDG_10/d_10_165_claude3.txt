Here is a detailed, academic article about UN Sustainable Development Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities), drafted in the irreverent and satirical style of novelist Carl Hiaasen:

Greetings, Folks - Put on Your Hazmat Suits, We're Wading into the Festering Swamp of Inequality

If you're one of those bright-eyed do-gooders who thinks we can just snap our fingers and make everybody equal, you're in for a rude awakening. Inequality is as old and stubborn as the first caveman who bashed his neighbor over the head for a bigger chunk of mastodonian haunch. It's ingrained in our species' selfish little DNA strands. The haves have always wanted to have more, and the have-nots spend their lives getting crapped on.

Now there's this fancy new Sustainable Development Goal calling for reduced inequalities by 2030. That's quite an ambitious moon shot, considering our entire world is built on a ramshackle scaffolding of imbalance and injustice. It's like seeing a mega-church with a tarnished steeple and saying, "Hey, let's make that whole corroded edifice disappear in just nine years!"  

Don't get me wrong, I'm all for equality in theory. It's just that human history tells a different story - one grisly chapter after another of oppression, exploitation, and the spoils going to the greediest thugs. Sorry to be Mr. Cynicism here, but does anyone really think the filthy rich oligarchs and crony capitalists are gonna share their caviar and single-malt Scotch because the UN politely asked them to?

Maybe I'm just jaded from living in Florida, God's oven mitt, where inequities are embedded deeper than the lips on a snapping turtle. The Sunshine State is like a terrarium for observing imbalances run amok. We've got dilapidated trailer parks right next to swanky beach communities with triple-digit membership fees. We treat our tourism workers like expendable indentured servants while catering to every whim of the nouveau riche abnormally tan "housewives."  We exploit immigrant farm laborers to harvest our fruits and veggies for slave wages. Oh, and let's not forget our legendary environmental racism, despoiling minority neighborhoods with toxins that would make Love Canal look like a hazmat-free nursery. 

So while eradicating inequality is a laudable idea championed by the UN's bevy of well-intentioned alphabet-soupers, it has about as much chance of succeeding as Greg Norman winning another major. Not in this corrupt world run by megalomaniacal plutocrats, bigwigs, robber barons, and various other masters of the gilded racket. True equity goes against the very fabric of human nature - the ceaseless striving for more, the quest for power and control, and the inborn drive to oppress anybody standing in your way. 

I applaud the UN's lofty goal, I really do. But its idealism has as much staying power as a raft of recycled "Save the Manatee" bumper stickers. Greed and self-interest are the stubborn realities, folks, no matter how many well-meaning equity agendas get rubber stamped in Belgium or wherever the UN commissioners sip their sustainable lattes. So enjoy the dream of a level playing field, but know that you're just as likely to see warthogs sprout wings and fly coach.
