From the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Italian Development Cooperation Programme, we present an in-depth analysis on Sustainable Development Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities. This critical issue lies at the heart of Italy's commitment to sustainable development, both within our borders and through our extensive international cooperation efforts.

Inequality manifests in myriad forms - income disparities, unequal access to opportunities and essential services, discrimination based on factors like gender, ethnicity, disability status, and more. Its far-reaching impacts undermine social cohesion, hamper economic growth, and perpetuate cycles of poverty and marginalization. Tackling inequality is therefore crucial for achieving the entirety of the 2030 Agenda.

Within Italy, we have made notable strides in reducing income inequality through progressive taxation policies and robust social safety nets. However, significant socioeconomic divides persist between our northern and southern regions. We are intensifying efforts to bridge these gaps through targeted investments in education, healthcare, infrastructure, and employment opportunities in disadvantaged areas. Furthermore, our comprehensive National Strategy for the Inclusion of Roma, Sinti, and Caminanti Communities aims to empower these long-marginalized groups and foster their full societal participation.

On the global stage, Italy contributes over €5 billion annually in Official Development Assistance (ODA), with a core focus on inequality reduction. A flagship initiative is our partnership with the United Nations Development Programme to establish the Regional Hub for Sustainable Development in Istanbul. This catalytic platform drives regional cooperation, knowledge-sharing, and capacity-building to accelerate SDG progress across Western Asia, Europe, and beyond.

Our aid prioritizes least developed countries (LDCs), with 30% of bilateral ODA channeled to support their socioeconomic advancement. For instance, in Mozambique, we have invested €25 million in the PADES initiative to enhance food security, nutrition, and rural livelihoods for over 2 million vulnerable people. Complementing this, our €15 million ProEco initiative fosters sustainable agriculture practices that build climate resilience while safeguarding biodiversity. Such integrated efforts exemplify Italy's commitment to the indivisible SDG agenda.

Furthermore, Italy champions policies and global partnerships to facilitate safe, orderly, and regular migration while protecting migrant rights. We have partnered with the International Organization for Migration to implement the Sustainable Reintegration and Migration Governance initiative. This €15 million program supports diaspora entrepreneurship, job creation, and community reintegration across several African nations.

Looking ahead, we recognize persistent challenges like growing global wealth concentration, stagnating social mobility, and deepening digital divides exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Italy will intensify multi-stakeholder collaboration to develop innovative solutions addressing systemic barriers and empowering marginalized groups worldwide.

At the heart of our efforts is a steadfast belief that reducing inequalities is not only a moral imperative but a prerequisite for building inclusive, just, and prosperous societies. By fostering equal opportunities, human dignity, and fundamental freedoms for all, we pave the way for sustainable development that leaves no one behind. Italy remains unwavering in our resolve to combat inequality in all its forms through transformative policies, strategic partnerships, and catalytic investments that uplift the world's most vulnerable.
