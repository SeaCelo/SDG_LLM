Bold Moves to Tackle Inequality: An Entrepreneur's Imperative

By Emilia Fernandez, Serial Entrepreneur & Sustainable Development Advocate 

The chasm of inequality that plagues our world is more than a moral crisis - it's an economic one that entrepreneurs cannot afford to ignore. As business leaders, we have a unique opportunity and responsibility to drive meaningful change through our enterprises. Reduced inequalities within and among countries, as outlined in the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 10, should be a top priority on every entrepreneur's agenda.

Let's start with some sobering facts: The 26 richest billionaires own as many assets as the poorest 50% of the world's population. Income inequality is growing for more than 70% of the global population, with the poorest 40% capturing less than 25 cents of every dollar added to global income. These disparities are perpetuated by systemic discrimination against marginalized groups based on gender, ethnicity, race, religion, disability, sexual orientation and age.

The consequences reverberate across societies and markets. Extreme economic inequality impedes social mobility and human capital development. It breeds resentment, social instability, and economic imbalances that undermine consumer demand and sustainable growth. For entrepreneurs, this translates into restricted market opportunities, supply chain vulnerabilities, and diminished long-term viability. We simply cannot afford to turn a blind eye.

Rather than relying on charitable donations or government initiatives, I believe entrepreneurs must take the lead in disrupting inequality through core business strategies. We need to embed the principles of equity, inclusion, and empowerment into the very DNA of our enterprises and ecosystems. Here are three key focus areas:

Employment Empowerment: Our companies must become models of equitable employment, with proactive programs to recruit, retain, and promote diverse talent across all levels. This includes implementing robust policies against discrimination, offering fair and living wages, and creating inclusive cultures where everyone feels valued and empowered to thrive. We should also partner with organizations that provide training and career pathways for underrepresented groups.

Supplier Inclusion: A truly inclusive business extends opportunities across the entire supply chain. By intentionally sourcing from minority-owned businesses, investing in entrepreneurship programs for marginalized communities, and adopting equitable procurement practices, we can drive economic integration and prosperity at the grassroots level.

Market Disruption: Many of the most promising business opportunities lie in developing affordable, accessible products and services for underserved populations. From financial inclusion and education solutions to clean energy and healthcare innovations, there is immense potential for startups that can crack these markets in a socially responsible manner.  

Of course, this transformative work cannot occur in isolation. We need unprecedented collaboration across sectors - entrepreneurs, corporations, governments, civil society, and impact investors must align in an unwavering commitment to tackle systemic barriers.

Some of the world's most visionary leaders have already begun this charge. Take the Tent Partnership for Refugees, which has mobilized over 180 companies worldwide to provide economic opportunities for the displaced. Or Andela, a brilliant startup that identifies and trains top software engineers across Africa, helping them integrate into the global marketplace.  

My fellow entrepreneurs, the time is now to harness our disruptive prowess for the greater good. Reducing inequalities is not just a moral obligation, but an existential priority for sustaining markets and fueling long-term prosperity. Those who embed these principles early will gain a profound competitive advantage as economies become more equitable and inclusive. 

So what are you waiting for? Start rigorously examining your organization through this lens today. Because beyond the immense social impact, embracing equity is simply good business sense for the innovation vanguards shaping our collective future.
