As China's premier international development agency, the China International Development Cooperation Agency (CIDCA) recognizes the critical importance of Sustainable Development Goal 10 (SDG 10) in promoting reduced inequalities within and among countries. Our commitment to this goal stems from a deep understanding of the inextricable link between inequality and sustainable development, as well as our unwavering belief in fostering a more equitable and inclusive global community.

In recent years, China has made significant strides in addressing domestic inequalities, particularly through targeted poverty alleviation initiatives and the promotion of inclusive economic growth. However, we acknowledge that inequality remains a pressing challenge, both within our borders and on a global scale. Recognizing the multifaceted nature of this issue, our approach to SDG 10 encompasses a range of comprehensive strategies and interventions.

One of our key priorities is to empower and promote the social, economic, and political inclusion of all, irrespective of age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion, or economic or other status. We are actively working to eliminate discriminatory laws, policies, and practices, while simultaneously promoting appropriate legislation, policies, and actions in this regard. This encompasses initiatives aimed at ensuring equal opportunities and reducing inequalities of outcome, including by eliminating discriminatory practices and promoting appropriate legislation, policies, and actions in this regard.

Furthermore, we are committed to adopting policies that promote the progressive achievement of greater equality, particularly through fiscal, wage, and social protection policies. Our efforts in this domain encompass a range of interventions, from strengthening the redistributive capacity of taxation systems to enhancing the coverage and adequacy of social protection measures, with a particular focus on the most vulnerable segments of society.

Recognizing the intrinsic link between inequality and migration, we are actively engaged in facilitating orderly, safe, regular, and responsible migration and mobility of people. This includes implementing well-managed migration policies that promote the socioeconomic integration of migrants, while also addressing the adverse drivers of forced displacement and irregular migration. Our approach emphasizes the protection of labor rights and the promotion of safe and secure working environments for all workers, including migrant workers, particularly women migrants, and those in precarious employment.

Moreover, we are cognizant of the need to foster greater representation and voice for developing countries in decision-making processes within global international economic and financial institutions. Through strategic engagement and advocacy, we are actively promoting reforms that enhance the effective participation of these nations and ensure their equitable representation in accordance with their evolving economic and financial weight.

Underpinning our efforts is a firm commitment to enhancing international cooperation, including through facilitating official development assistance and financial flows to countries where the need is greatest. We are actively engaging with our international partners to mobilize additional resources from a variety of sources, with the aim of providing adequate and predictable means for developing countries to implement programs and policies that promote greater equality.

While challenges persist, we remain resolute in our pursuit of SDG 10, recognizing that reducing inequalities is not only a moral imperative but also a catalyst for sustainable development, economic growth, and social cohesion. Through our multifaceted approach, which encompasses policy interventions, capacity-building initiatives, and international cooperation, we are steadfast in our commitment to fostering a more equitable and inclusive global community, where no one is left behind.
