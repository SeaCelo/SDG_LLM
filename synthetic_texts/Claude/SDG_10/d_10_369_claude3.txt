As an organization at the forefront of addressing rural poverty and striving for inclusive societies, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) recognizes the critical importance of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 10: Reducing Inequalities Within and Among Countries. This imperative cuts across all aspects of our work, as inequalities in income, opportunity, and access to resources perpetuate the vicious cycle of poverty, particularly in the rural communities we serve.

Globally, the gap between the rich and poor continues to widen, exacerbated by factors such as unequal access to education, healthcare, and technology, as well as discrimination based on gender, ethnicity, or disability. This inequality stifles economic growth, fuels social unrest, and undermines efforts towards sustainable development. In the agricultural sector, smallholder farmers and rural populations face disproportionate challenges, including limited access to markets, credit, and productive resources like land and water. Climate change further exacerbates these inequalities, with the poorest communities bearing the brunt of its impacts.

IFAD recognizes that addressing these inequalities requires a multifaceted approach, involving stakeholders at all levels â€“ from policymakers and international organizations to civil society and local communities. Our investments prioritize marginalized groups, such as women, youth, and indigenous peoples, empowering them through improved access to resources, skills development, and inclusive value chains. For example, in Rwanda, our Sustainable Rural Rehabilitation and Development Project has facilitated the establishment of over 500 farmer cooperatives, enabling smallholders to collectively access markets, negotiate better prices, and improve their incomes.

Furthermore, we collaborate with governments to implement policies and legal frameworks that promote equal rights and opportunities, particularly regarding land ownership, inheritance, and access to productive resources. In Tajikistan, our Livestock and Pasture Development Project has supported the development of community-based natural resource management plans, ensuring equitable access to pasture resources for all community members, including women and marginalized groups.

Addressing inequalities within and among countries also necessitates international cooperation and knowledge-sharing. IFAD actively participates in global forums and partnerships, advocating for increased investments in rural development and promoting inclusive policies and practices. For instance, our Facilitation of Rural Entrepreneurship, Investment and Trade (FREIGHT) initiative aims to connect smallholder farmers and rural entrepreneurs to regional and global value chains, thereby reducing economic disparities.

Looking ahead, IFAD recognizes the need for continued innovation and adaptation to address emerging challenges posed by climate change, conflicts, and population displacement. We are exploring the potential of digital technologies to bridge the information and knowledge gaps faced by rural communities, while also promoting inclusive financial services and risk management tools. Moreover, we prioritize the collection and analysis of disaggregated data to better understand and address the specific needs and vulnerabilities of different marginalized groups.

In conclusion, reducing inequalities within and among countries is a complex and multidimensional challenge that requires concerted efforts from all stakeholders. IFAD remains steadfast in its commitment to empowering rural communities, promoting inclusive policies, and fostering international cooperation to achieve this critical goal. By addressing inequalities and ensuring no one is left behind, we can unlock the full potential of rural communities and accelerate progress towards sustainable development for all.
