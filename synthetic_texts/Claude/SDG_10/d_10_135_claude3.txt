Here is a long academic article about SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), written from the perspective of political satirist Mark Steel:

Inequality: The World's Biggest Punchline

If you want to know why the world is so bloody unequal, just look at the people in charge. A puffed-up cabal of wealthy blowhards who think equality means making sure every super-yacht has the same thread count on its Egyptian cotton sheets. These out-of-touch toffs are so far removed from the common person, they may as well be living in a diamond-encrusted space colony orbiting Xanadu.  

Don't get me wrong, I've got nothing against being stinking rich. If I could afford a solid gold toilet, you bet your chuffin' life I'd have one installed. Maybe even two—one for number ones and a separate throne for the others. What I object to is the rank hypocrisy and utter obliviousness of these elite poltroons as they preach about reducing inequality while gorging themselves on $1,000 canapes. 

Just look at the gob-smacking numbers. The 26 richest billionaires own as many assets as the poorest 3.8 billion people. Let that colossal fact just slap you across the face for a minute. That's more than the entire population of India, the United States, Pakistan, Brazil, and the European Union put together. Scrunched up and crammed into the silk-lined pockets of two dozen pampered plutocrat parasites. If that's not the punchline to the sickest joke in history, I don't know what is.

And don't get me started on income inequality. In 2017, a worker in the gig economy could log millions of hours on one of those tech disruptor apps before earning the annual compensation of a top-paid CEO. What kind of rarefied fantasy land are these c-suite con artists living in where that sort of imbalance seems even remotely justifiable? Surely they must realize that a sustainable society—one where people don't burn the whole blooming system to the ground—requires some basic level of fairness and economic justice.

But of course they don't realize it, because they're too busy hoovering up the world's resources like it's an all-you-can-eat caviar buffet. The sad truth is, the global elite has absolutely no incentive to rock the gravy boat of structural inequity that keeps them guzzling from the trough of unconscionable privilege. Why would they? For them, the status quo is the cat's tuxedo-ed pajamas.  

And so the cycle of wealth concentration continues unabated, turbocharged by the same ethnic, gender, and racial biases that have sustained inequality since civilization's gong was first rung. Because guess what, chumrades? Even among the global 1%, it's a teeny-tiny minority of white codgers holding the lion's share of assets. I know, you're utterly shocked by this stunning revelation.

It's enough to make you want to swing a wrecking ball through the nearest bank of windows. Or at least flick a few V-signs at the next Davos impersonation event you happen to jovially troll by. Not that such reasoned protest would sway the immovable ignoramuses in the inequality bunker, mind you. Those gurgling knob-cheeses are more impervious to moral suasion than Buckingham Palace is to sunlight.

So what's to be done, my friends? Well, if the 17 Sustainable Development Goals have taught us anything, it's that complex global problems require comprehensive, multi-faceted strategies that dismantle systemic barriers and empower marginalized populations through inclusive, bottom-up policy approaches... 

Nah, just kidding. We all know the only solution is to eat the rich. Then once we've scoffed the last of those plump, confit-ed plutocrats, we can seize the upholstered means of production and build a more equitable world for the remaining 99.99% of humanity. Who's up for putting the residential high-rises of the landed gentry on a spit?
