Inequality: The Great Destabilizer Threatening Global Growth and Markets

By the Barron's Editorial Board

For investors attuned to emerging risks to their portfolios, rising inequality globally should be sounding deafening alarm bells. Though often discussed through a moral lens, worsening inequality poses severe threats to financial markets and economic stability that can no longer be ignored. As the United Nations frames it in Sustainable Development Goal 10, we must "reduce inequality within and among countries" to secure prosperous and sustainable development worldwide.

Inequality has reached crisis levels. The 26 richest individuals now possess as much wealth as the poorest 50% of the global population combined. Income inequality within nations is soaring as well, with the top 10% capturing a staggering 40% of total labor income across the OECD. This extreme concentration of wealth and income confers outsized economic power into few hands while depriving billions of economic opportunity and mobility. Such stark inequality inevitably breeds resentment, societal fractures, and instability that reverberate through markets.

Indeed, we need look no further than our own markets for a microcosm of the destabilizing forces at play. Deteriorating economic conditions for the working and middle classes were a driving force fueling the populist backlash exemplified by Brexit and the U.S. 2016 election - events that roiled global markets. Persistently high inequality exacerbated by tepid recovery further set the stage for the "alienated majority" that spawned these seismic political shifts.

The inequality risk extends far beyond rich nations, threatening economic development and political stability worldwide that underpin healthy markets. In developing regions, high inequality obstructs poverty reduction efforts as gains accrue disproportionately to top earners. In many African nations, consumption growth for the poorest 40% has been flat or declining while the top 20% captures most of the gains. This breeds frustration and unrest that deters investment.

Latin America exemplifies the threats vividly. Despite a commodity-driven GDP boom in the 2000s, the region's persistently high inequality saw those gains captured by elites. Stagnant wages sparked angry protests and the rise of destabilizing populist regimes like Chavez's Venezuela that assailed markets. Even thriving nations like Chile have seen disruptive unrest over inequality. As developing markets now comprise over half of global GDP, domestic inequality has become a systemic international risk.

Viewed through this lens, the economic case for reducing inequality is clear. High inequality suppresses economic growth as it constrains domestic demand, human capital development, and social mobility - the engines of sustainable long-term growth. The IMF estimates that a 1% increase in a nation's income share accruing to the top 20% lowers GDP growth by nearly 0.1% over 5 years, while a similar rise in the bottom 20%'s share corresponds to a 0.38% higher growth rate. Inequality acts as a stubborn economic headwind.

Rising automation and mass disruptions from climate change and other megatrends threaten to aggravate inequality further unless mitigated by inclusive policies, threatening a vicious cycle of unrest and instability reverberating across markets. Multinational companies and investors cannot remain insulated, as exemplified by the mounting pressure on corporate America to address internal inequality.

In short, the material risks of inequality are too glaring to ignore. Reducing inequality through progressive tax policies, investing in human capital, promoting decent work opportunities, enforcing equal pay and labor laws, and empowering marginalized groups is not just ethical - it's a financial imperative to preserve functioning markets and sustainable growth worldwide. Investments seeking long-term value creation cannot afford to ignore the inequality wildfire raging globally.
