Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities) as if written by the journalist Froma Harrop:

Tackling the Inequality Scourge: An Inexcusable Failure of Progress and Political Will

By Froma Harrop

Inequality has reached grotesque levels in many nations, posing an existential threat to social cohesion, economic prosperity, and basic human dignity. Despite lofty rhetoric from world leaders about creating more inclusive societies, the reality is one of yawning chasms between the ultra-wealthy and the masses caught in poverty's grip. The 10th Sustainable Development Goal of reducing inequalities within and among countries represents one of the world's most egregious and infuriating failures over the past decade.

The statistics are damning. The 26 richest billionaires own as many assets as the poorest 50% of the global population. In the United States, the three wealthiest individuals possess more wealth than the bottom 50% of Americans combined. Such obscene disparities would spark revolt in any ethically coherent society, yet we numbly accept them as normative.  

This inequality pandemic has been turbocharged by overtly hostile policies and a zeal for upward wealth redistribution. While working families have seen stagnant wages amid eroding worker protections, corporations and the investor class have enjoyed lavish tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks, and policies that enshrine monopolistic price-gouging as quasi-religious dogma. For the plutocrats, no fortune is too large, no acquisition too rapacious.  

Meanwhile, the impacts on everyday people have been devastating. Rising costs for housing, healthcare, and education have plunged millions of households into crippling debt and multi-generational poverty traps. Infrastructure degradation, social services cuts, and assaults on labor rights create hierarchies of despair where the privileged reside in gilded bubbles amid furious upheaval for the underclasses.    

We have failed catastrophically on multiple fronts in the battle against inequality. Taxation systems across the globe have become grotesquely regressive, affording minuscule rates for the wealthy while overburdening wage earners. Public investments in education, skills training, and economic mobility ladders have withered. Efforts to diversify corporate leadership and combat discriminatory employment practices have achieved negligible progress. Above all, a venomous repudiation of concepts like shared prosperity and economic inclusion has implanted a cancerous hyper-capitalism fueled by greed and indifference.

The ramifications of our abject policy failures extend far beyond macreconomic indicators and arid data points. Unchecked inequality serves as a millstone around humanity's collective ambitions, dragging down societal progress and metastasizing into seething unrest. Economic and social stratification engenders hopelessness, atomization, and fertile terrain for demagogues inciting unrest.  Unredressed inequities corrupt governance, erode social trust, and subvert democratic norms as the masses lose faith in rigged systems.

No amount of philanthropic window-dressing can conceal these fundamental truths. For every food bank keeping families fed, hedge fund managers accrue more wealth daily than impoverished communities see in generations. For every scholarship granted or ramshackle school rebuilt, oligarchs construct mammoth bunker estates to hide from the very inequality conflagrations they stoked. 

The injustice is sickening, and the culpability belongs to those in power. Our policies and priorities actively deepen inequality, stacking the economic deck against workers, the disabled, minorities, and the poor. This obliterates meritocratic principles and social mobility. We are crafting neo-feudal hierarchies where the accident of birth becomes destiny, as unfettered capitalist extremism scatters the rungs of the opportunity ladder.

Reversing this monstrous trajectory requires boldness, not placating incrementalism. We must legislate more steeply progressive taxes on corporations and personal wealth, cracking down on tax havens and loopholes rigged for the rich. Unionization must be vigorously safeguarded and expanded to rein in unchecked corporate avarice. Public investments in education, job training, childcare, healthcare, and living wages are ethical and economic imperatives. Rigorous enforcement of anti-discrimination laws and diversity mandates is crucial for leveling playing fields long tilted towards privileged groups.

Critics will dismiss such clarion calls as ruinous 'wealth redistribution' or fanciful egalitarian dreaming. But these are the legitimate prerequisites for reviving the social contract and stabilizing civil society before inequality's centrifugal forces tear nations asunder. We either commit to sweeping reforms, or resign future generations to the cruelties of neo-feudal stratification.  

Inequality is not an inevitability but a conscious choice. The bellwether for human civilization will be whether compassion and justice triumph over the fetishization of unchecked greed. We possess the means and knowledge to realize the SDG of reducing inequalities. What remains unforgivably absent is the moral courage and political will to act. Complacency is inequality's most pernicious enabler â€“ will we rise to defeat the scourge of our time?
