Here is a draft academic article on SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities) as if written by journalist Jonathan Freedland:

Inequalities Within and Among Countries: The Moral Imperative of Our Time

By Jonathan Freedland

The 10th Sustainable Development Goal issued a clarion call to the world - reduce inequality within and among countries. On the surface, it seems a rather straightforward objective. But dig deeper, and you quickly realize just how enormously complex and daunting this challenge truly is. Inequality is one of the most insidious and pervasive plagues afflicting humanity. It warps societies, undermines human potential, and acts as a stubborn brake on economic vitality and social progress. Tackling it will require not just political willpower, but a fundamental reexamination of how we have structured our economic systems and calibrated our moral priorities.

The scale of the problem is staggering. The world's richest 1% now own more wealth than the rest of the planet combined. The three wealthiest individuals have total assets greater than the combined GDP of the poorest 48 countries. Within nations, the trajectory is similarly disturbing - in the United States, for example, the gap in life expectancy between the richest and poorest is now over a decade. Lest we dismiss these as mere economic disparities, inequality imperils our democracies, weakens social cohesion, and constrains human capital development for billions stuck in deprivation.

But what is driving such stark imbalances? At the global level, an under-regulated international tax architecture enables corporate profits to be shunted into low-tax jurisdictions, depriving countries of vital revenues to invest in development. Unfair trade practices put developing countries at a disadvantage. Runaway wealth concentration atop a rigged economic system empowers a select elite to rig the rules further in their favor, entrenching inequality even more. Immigration policies in rich nations cherry-pick skilled labor from poorer states, exacerbating human capital deficits.

Within countries, labor's share of income has declined drastically vis-a-vis capital in recent decades. The playing field is tilted, with market-distorting subsidies, monopolistic dynamics, regressive fiscal policies, and discriminatory norms all favoring those who already wield economic clout. Unequal access to healthcare, education, finance, and digital technologies then magnifies these divides across generations.

The imperative to reverse these dynamics could not be more urgent. Every major faith and ethical tradition counsels us to favor the poor, uplift the downtrodden, and order our societies on principles of fairness, justice and human dignity. Do we really wish to bequeath our children a world so starkly cleaved between opulence and squalor? One where life's prospects are virtually predetermined by an accident of birth? Where meritocracy is a pathetic facade and dreams of upward mobility are crushed under the weight of entrenched privilege?

There are glimmers of hope. Voices across the ideological spectrum have awoken to the moral urgency of addressing inequality. New analytical tools allow us to rigorously diagnose its institutional drivers. Revolutionary technologies could help leapfrog development bottlenecks. A global consensus has taken root around the Sustainable Development Goals as a roadmap.

But progress demands profound political courage to disrupt entrenched interests and overturn an economic orthodoxy hardwired toward inequality. It necessitates crafting smarter policies, upgrading governance capacities, eliminating discriminatory barriers, empowering civic participation, and mobilizing vastly greater investments in human capital and resilient infrastructure. Above all, it compels modern societies to finally live up to their espoused ideals - equal worth, common dignity, justice, and a fair opportunity for all.

Reducing inequalities within and among nations is not just a policy agenda, but a moral imperative that will define this era. How we respond will be a litmus test of our common humanity. We must not be found wanting.
