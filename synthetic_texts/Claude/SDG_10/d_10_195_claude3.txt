Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities), written from the perspective of conservative columnist Cal Thomas:

Inequality is one of the greatest challenges we face as a global society. The tentacles of inequality reach far and wide, manifesting in disparities of income, wealth, opportunity, and basic human rights across both developed and developing nations. The 10th Sustainable Development Goal set forth by the United Nations seeks to "reduce inequalities within and among countries." While the intent is admirable, the solutions proposed represent an expansive government overreach that risks trampling on economic freedom and individual liberty.

At its core, SDG 10 advocates for "income growth of the bottom 40 per cent of the population at a rate higher than the national average." This is to be achieved through fiscal and social policies that promote equality. However, one must scrutinize the implications of such policies. Aggressive wealth redistribution and punitive taxes on the affluent disrupt the organic incentive structures that have proven to generate economic growth and lift people out of poverty.  

History has shown that free market capitalism, when coupled with the rule of law and private property rights, is the greatest catalyst for human prosperity the world has ever known. It was the embrace of free market principles that allowed nations like the United States to build a vibrant middle class and foster an environment of unparalleled entrepreneurial innovation and economic mobility. In contrast, the ideology of economic equality through government intervention has been an abject failure everywhere it has been tried, perpetuating a cycle of deprivation and eroding the human spirit.

SDG 10 also calls for "equal opportunity" and an end to discriminatory practices and policies. While equality under the law is a laudable principle found in the constitutions of many nations, the execution of "equal opportunity" policies has often devolved into a form of institutional oppression and reverse discrimination. Racial quotas, gender preferences, and ideological litmus tests in education admissions and workforce hiring have become common. In the zero-sum game of institutionalized equal outcomes, those deemed sufficiently "privileged" are held to a different and higher standard.

The United Nations also advocates for open migration policies under SDG 10, arguing that "migration is a powerful driver of economic growth." While a sane level of legal immigration can potentially offer economic benefits, there is also a tipping point where excessive migration depresses wages, strains public resources, threatens cultural fabrics, and compromises national security. Uncontrolled migration from the developing world to the West and stifling economic policies of overregulation could effectively level the playing field of global prosperity â€“ but at the lowest common denominator.

Rather than centralized policies of wealth redistribution and economic stagnation, the path to reducing inequality lies in protecting the fundamentals of free enterprise, essential human liberties, and the rule of law. It is economic freedom, not government coercion, that provides the greatest avenues for human flourishing and shared prosperity among the peoples of the world. We must reject the siren song of Marxist ideology cloaked in the euphemism of "sustainable development" and embrace the transcendent policies of freedom.
