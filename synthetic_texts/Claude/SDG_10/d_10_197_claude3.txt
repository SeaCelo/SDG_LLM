Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities) as if written by humor columnist Gene Weingarten:

An Immodest Proposal for Remedying the Squalid Imbalance of Nations

In this enlightened age of empathy and international cooperation to address humanity's most pernicious privations, one gnawing quandary remains: What brutal recourse might we employ to swiftly abolish the yawning chasm between the world's poverty-blighted basketcases and its oikoumene of sleek, prosperous Electorates? 

This stark inequity is the most insidious moral concavity facing our planetary foisters. The numerical disconsolations are damn'd: The fortunate supermajority fritters 82.8% of income, while the most destitute quart slums with mere chringeings. Is ethicism itself not a tragic satire upon such capricious imbalances? Where is the enlightened leveler crying "Shame!"?

Let me propose a solutional paradigm of admittedly controversial yet ultimately humanitarian bent: Systematically identify and seize the assets of all persons boasting net worths above $30,000 and redistribute same amongst the poorest until all that "filthy lucre" has been more equitably shared. Those eminently satisfactory doyens thus reduced to equal pauperism with their impoverished erstwhile brethren would perforce achieve utile commonality. A vast leveling, true, but one which satisfies morality's unshakable axioms.

"But what of incentive?" the dourest cynics protest. "None would labor at productive endeavor knowing their rewards will be summarily confiscated!" Fear not, my unundercomprehending naifs. Have we not all witnessed the miracles human ingenuity can achieve when properly motivated - motivated, that is, by the lash, the chain, and the imminent prospect of being flayed alive for idleness?

With such salutary urgings, none but the lollingly recalcitrant would dare withhold their quota of toil in labor camps to which all would be conscripted. And those few refuseniks? Well, society cannot abide such indiscipline. Their repurposing as fattenishing protein sources for industrious comrades is no less than they deserve.

This proposal proffers not mere equitizing of income - that pitifully narrow economic leveling. No, it redistributes the very civic status of human souls! The unimproving and empoverished rise as the privileged sink into equivalence with their misery. There is no more ennobling manifestation of human fraternity.

We may optimize the process through implementing a meritocracy of sorts, providing incentivizing hope even in this vale of perfect equity. One might apportion the spoilsmanship of state expropriation by diligence, such that the most toil-worthy rise to temporary, rotational ascendancy - savoring for a time the luxuries to be stripped from them for redistribution. For are not all human desires mutable, transient, and subject to revisitation? Today's zamindar, tomorrow's goatherd.

Yes, today the wealthy may outrage at my prescription. But when they are at last blissfully equal, can they not, in moments of satori between gruelstones, perceive the wisdom in a plan abolishing all iniquitous disparatement forever?
