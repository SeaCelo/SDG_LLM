The International Organization for Migration (IOM) recognizes that reducing inequalities within and among countries, as outlined in Sustainable Development Goal 10 (SDG 10), is a fundamental prerequisite for achieving sustainable development and promoting human mobility in a safe, orderly, and dignified manner. Despite concerted global efforts, the world remains far from achieving this goal, with persistent and multidimensional inequalities hindering progress on various fronts.

One of the most pressing challenges lies in the widening income disparities within and across nations. According to recent estimates, the richest 10% of the global population accounts for over 50% of total income, while the poorest 40% holds less than 10%. This stark inequality not only undermines social cohesion and economic stability but also fuels irregular migration patterns, as individuals increasingly seek better opportunities elsewhere.

The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these inequalities, disproportionately impacting marginalized groups, including migrants, refugees, and internally displaced persons (IDPs). Many migrant workers, particularly those in the informal sector, have faced job losses, reduced remittances, and heightened vulnerability to exploitation and abuse. Access to essential services, such as healthcare and education, has been further constrained, perpetuating cycles of deprivation and marginalization.

Intersectional discrimination remains a significant barrier to achieving SDG 10. Migrants and displaced populations often face multiple and compounding forms of discrimination based on factors such as gender, age, disability, ethnicity, and legal status. Women and girls, in particular, are at heightened risk of exploitation, trafficking, and gender-based violence, which can have long-lasting impacts on their well-being and socioeconomic integration.

Climate change and environmental degradation are also exacerbating inequalities, with the most vulnerable populations bearing the brunt of their impacts. As natural disasters and resource scarcity intensify, migration patterns are likely to shift, potentially leading to increased displacement and heightened tensions between host communities and newcomers.

To address these challenges, IOM advocates for a comprehensive and multi-stakeholder approach that leverages the potential of migration as a driver of sustainable development. This includes promoting inclusive and equitable policies that facilitate safe and orderly migration, protecting the rights and dignity of all migrants, and fostering social cohesion and integration within host communities.

Enhancing international cooperation and strengthening global governance frameworks are crucial in this regard. IOM supports efforts to create more robust and transparent mechanisms for the safe and orderly movement of people, while also advocating for the portability of social security entitlements and the recognition of skills and qualifications across borders.

Moreover, IOM emphasizes the need for targeted interventions that address the specific vulnerabilities and challenges faced by different migrant groups. This includes supporting the empowerment and leadership of migrant and diaspora organizations, promoting access to decent work and social protection, and ensuring access to essential services, regardless of legal status.

Crucially, IOM recognizes the importance of addressing the root causes of forced migration and displacement, such as conflict, persecution, and environmental degradation. This requires concerted efforts to promote peace, stability, and sustainable development in countries of origin, while also strengthening resilience and preparedness measures in vulnerable communities.

In conclusion, achieving SDG 10 and reducing inequalities within and among countries is a complex and multifaceted challenge that requires a concerted and coordinated global response. IOM remains committed to working with member states, international organizations, and civil society partners to promote inclusive and equitable policies, protect the rights and dignity of all migrants, and leverage the transformative potential of migration for sustainable development.
