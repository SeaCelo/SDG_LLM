Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities) from the perspective of Margaret Wente, a Canadian journalist known for her controversial and contrarian views:

The Unbearable Hypocrisy of the UN's Inequality Agenda

By Margaret Wente

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal of reducing inequality within and between countries is a classic example of virtue signalling run amok. This lofty aim, endorsed by world leaders as part of the 2030 Agenda, reeks of hypocrisy and willful naivety.

Let's start with inequality within countries. In laudable-sounding language, SDG 10 calls for promoting the "social, economic and political inclusion of all." But true inclusiveness is antithetical to meritocracy, which rewards talent, hard work and perseverance. Any attempt to artificially flatten society and equalize outcomes - whether through punitive taxes, race-based quotas or other heavy-handed wealth redistribution schemes - will inevitably demoralize strivers and high achievers who create prosperity in the first place.

The consequences are evident in Scandinavia, where decades of socialist economic policies have dampened entrepreneurship, eroded competitiveness, and squandered human capital. With punishing top marginal tax rates, even star hockey players leave for more opportunity elsewhere. As the late Swedish statistician Hans Rosling observed, embracing equality has resulted in a mass of children becoming "secure underachievers" rather than reaching their potential.

Meanwhile, inequality between countries persists because too many nations remain mired in corruption, lacking economic freedom and property rights. The UN's own human rights apparatus legitimizes kleptocratic regimes that systematically plunder their own people. From Venezuela to Zimbabwe, resource wealth lines private pockets rather than funding public services. 

Why are countries with abundant natural resources often poor and unstable? Look no further than the UN itself. Composed of 193 member states, the UN is effectively held hostage by authoritarian states like China and Russia that see national sovereignty as a shield for repression. So long as tyrannies wield veto power on the Security Council, the institutional framework to sustainably uplift global living standards will remain illusive.

The development professionals and apparatchiks hired by UN agencies may be fervent idealists, but the organization is riven by politics and waste that undermine its stated aims. With over 100,000 employees and far-flung peacekeeping missions, the UN has an estimated $3 billion annual excessive spending problem according to internal audits. In the Congo alone, pervasive mismanagement and corruption have squandered millions meant for development.

While the lavishly paid UN bureaucrats formulate another framework or commission another report on reducing inequality, the undeniable truth is that economic freedom and flourishing civil society have proven the greatest catalysts for prosperity. From the Poverty Reduction Strategy in Rwanda to the free market economic zones of Shenzhen, growth and poverty reduction occur where governments respect private property rights, cultivate human capital, and promote participation in the global economy.

It's easy for comfortable Westerners indoctrinated in elite universities to embrace a utopian vision of a more equal world. But the lived experience across the developing world reveals the UN's anti-poverty campaigns rarely deliver sustainable results. SGD 10's calls for more foreign aid, better labour migration policies and "representative decision-making" at all levels are vague bromides detached from the harsh realities of institutional inertia and entrenched interests.

A true war on global inequality would dismantle protectionist policies in wealthy nations that deny opportunities to the world's poor. It would catalyze domestic economic reforms in low-income countries to attract investment, human capital and entrepreneurship. Rather than another glossy report from a UN committee of grandees, we need policies derived from cold pragmatism, not utopian overreach.

The road to inclusive prosperity doesn't run through New York City or Geneva. It winds through thriving economic zones where hard work meets innovation - from Bangalore to Shenzhen and beyond. True equality of opportunity empowers the poor, not lofty rhetoric that perpetuates the UN's privilege and failure to address systemic barriers to growth. Until the accountability and integrity deficits plaguing the UN are resolved, SDG 10 will remain an empty slogan.
