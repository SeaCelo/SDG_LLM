Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities) from the perspective of Cal Thomas, the conservative political commentator:

Inequality is one of the greatest challenges facing humanity in the 21st century. Despite significant economic and social progress in recent decades, vast disparities persist within and among nations. As humanity strives to build a more just and equitable world, it is imperative that we address the systemic factors driving inequality and marginalization. 

The 10th Sustainable Development Goal calls for reducing inequalities and promoting the social, economic and political inclusion of all people, irrespective of characteristics such as age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic status. While well-intentioned, this agenda represents a misguided and even dangerous intrusion of global activists into sovereign affairs.

At its core, the inequality agenda is rooted in the ideology of wealth redistribution and government interventionism. Its proponents harbor an inherent distrust of free markets and capitalism, instead embracing regulatory regimes and centralized economic planning. The relentless push for equity of outcomes, rather than equality of opportunity, strikes at the heart of liberal democracy and individual liberty.

Consider the example of policies designed to combat income inequality through progressive taxation and bloated social programs. Not only do such policies disincentivize productive economic behavior, but they foster a culture of entitlement and dependence on the state. Over time, this insidious dynamic erodes the very social mobility and economic vibrancy that the inequality agenda purportedly aims to promote.

Furthermore, the narrative surrounding inequality frequently resorts to bogus identity politics by framing group disparities as de facto evidence of systemic injustice. This toxic worldview rejects the dignity of the individual in favor of perpetual grievance and group think. It sows seeds of resentment and inflames societal tensions. The sensible solution is a principled rejection of group rights in favor of a colorblind framework that judges people as individuals rather than faceless members of designated racial or ethnic blocs.

Perhaps most pernicious is the inequality agenda's denigration of cultural values and national sovereignty. By advocating for globalized policies and subordinating nations to unaccountable United Nations bureaucrats, proponents of SDG 10 are actively undermining the rights of peoples to maintain their unique traditions, religions and ways of life. From the Christian conservative perspective, these values represent indispensable bulwarks against the relentless encroachment of moral relativism and secular humanism.

If humanity truly wishes to uplift the downtrodden and pursue sustainable progress, the solution lies in economic freedom, limited government, and respect for inalienable human rights. We must decisively reject the inequality agenda and its totalitarian vision of a homogenized global society devoid of national identity or individual liberty. Our future prosperity depends on a reaffirmation of classical liberal principles, the primacy of democratic nation-states, and faith in the power of divine providence.
