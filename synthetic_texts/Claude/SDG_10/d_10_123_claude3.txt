Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities), written from the perspective of the late journalist A.A. Gill in his characteristically acerbic and thought-provoking style:

The Unbearable Unfairness of Being
By A.A. Gill

The grand panjandrum of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals is SDG 10 - "Reduce inequality within and among countries." A more virtuous, right-on objective you couldn't hope to stumble across this side of a Billy Bragg lyrics sheet. It reeks of  secular  piety and self-congratulation. Just what you'd expect from that  multinational  monomania, the United Nations - purveyors of  diplomatic blitherspeak  and  do-gooding piffle to the globe's despots and dissemblers. 

But even  setting aside the UN's  tradition  of  idealistic  fatuation and  geopolitical  naivete, this whole egalitarian  errand is surely  doomed from the outset. It makes about as much sense as proposing a Sustainable Development Goal to eliminate  hurricanes or halitosis. Inequality is an inescapable  biological,  psychological and socioeconomic imperative - the unavoidable  corollary of competitiveness, human  diversity  and the implacable  fact that we are not,  nor have we ever been,  equal.

Even within individual nation states, there are yawning chasms of inequality based on ability,  inheritance, environment and  happenstance that no  amount of redistributive  fervor can ever  completely eradicate. And between countries? The very existence of borders  and sovereignty virtually guarantees inequality of  resources, opportunity and outcome. It is the baked-in design flaw intrinsic to the  entire  concept of  nationhood. 

Some  inequalities are manifestly unfair - discrimination by race, gender,  creed or  ableism. These  must be  challenged and  dismantled. But many of humanity's  inequalities are  defensible, even  desirable. Do we really want complete economic or experiential parity between  hard-working  strivers  and layabout sloths? Between   brilliant minds  and  mouth-breathing morons? Between those who selflessly devote their lives to the welfare of others and narcissistic sociopaths? Inequality is  the literal and metaphorical  acme of civilization.

And before the  Pecksniffian  schoolmarms start  clutching their pearls about my  alleged elitism and lack of empathy, even I don't advocate a Dickensian, Malthusian  culling of the weakest. I'm simply  venturing that rewarding the exceptional with  reasonable advantage - within sensible limits and constraints - is psychologically  motivating, driving human  endeavor and advancement.  Aspiration requires inspiration. And inspiration requires  inequalities to emulate and  aspire towards.

Ours is a paradoxical species -  cooperatively brilliant yet competitively  rapacious. We should prudently temper the potential for conflict, envy and  exploitation this dichotomy produces, but not delusionally seek to abolish  all inequality entirely. Nature  simply will not  allow it. Instead, we should  channel these intrinsic inequalities towards fulfilling, ethical, socially-productive ends. Not try to  homogenize humanity into  some grey, featureless, incentive-leeched mush. 

Like all the SDGs, SDG 10 is well-intentioned  codswollop - piously aspiring to an impossibility.  Egalitarian  pabulum that will only provide employment to  a great number of  under-worked, over-credentialed  social engineers, policy wonks and  'inequality analysts'   producing  ever-more unreadable  white papers and circulars in  perpetuity. All while leaving the  essential quandary - how to create a universal utopia of absolutely equally-distributed  experiences, prospects and fortunes - as insoluble and  quixotic as ever.

So much for reducing inequality. In reality, SDG 10 will only exacerbate inequalities by further enriching and empowering the  complacent,  cushy,  upper-middle class of professional  campaigners, social justice  warrior-grifters and  bien pensant  Hand-wringers. An  entire social  stratum dedicated to telling the rest of us what to think and how  to live - itself a pernicious form of privilege and oppression.
