In recent years, the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID) has intensified its efforts to address Sustainable Development Goal 10 (SDG 10), focused on reducing inequality within and among countries. This analytical report explores the persistent challenges, implemented strategies, and achievements to date.

Despite overall progress in human development, inequality remains a significant obstacle to sustainable development. Income, wealth, and opportunity gaps have deepened globally, exacerbated by factors such as globalization, armed conflicts, climate change, and recurring economic crises. These disparities not only undermine fundamental human rights but also weaken social cohesion, hinder inclusive economic growth, and threaten political stability.

In response to these challenges, AECID has adopted a multidimensional approach to addressing inequality in all its forms. A key pillar has been strengthening social protection systems in partner countries, ensuring equitable access to essential services such as healthcare, education, and food security. Programs like the Nutrition and Food Security Initiative in Guatemala have proven effective in improving nutritional outcomes and empowering marginalized communities.

Additionally, AECID has promoted equal opportunities through inclusive policies and affirmative actions. For instance, the Women's Leadership and Citizenship Program in El Salvador has trained hundreds of women in leadership and political participation skills, fostering their empowerment and representation in decision-making processes. Similarly, initiatives have been implemented to improve access to economic opportunities for disadvantaged groups, such as the microfinance program for entrepreneurs in rural areas of Peru.

However, addressing structural and systemic inequalities requires a comprehensive approach that goes beyond specific interventions. In this regard, AECID has prioritized promoting democratic governance, transparency, and accountability as fundamental pillars for reducing disparities. Through programs like Institutional Strengthening in Morocco, AECID has worked closely with local governments and civil society organizations to enhance the efficiency and integrity of public institutions while encouraging citizen participation in decision-making processes.

Another crucial aspect has been integrating the perspective of inequality into all of AECID's development actions. This involves conducting thorough analyses of existing gaps and designing targeted interventions to address different dimensions of inequality, such as gender, ethnicity, disability, or geographic location. For example, the Inclusive Rural Development Program in Bolivia has implemented differentiated strategies to ensure equitable access to services and opportunities for indigenous communities, women, and persons with disabilities in rural areas.

Despite significant progress, formidable challenges remain in achieving SDG 10. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing inequalities and threatens to reverse decades of development gains. Additionally, the effects of climate change and armed conflicts continue to displace millions of people and deepen socioeconomic gaps.

In response, AECID has adapted its strategies to address these emerging challenges. Inclusive economic recovery programs, such as the Green Employment Initiative in Mozambique, have been implemented, combining the creation of sustainable job opportunities with environmental protection. Furthermore, support for displaced and refugee populations has been intensified, providing humanitarian assistance and facilitating their integration into host communities.

Ultimately, AECID's commitment to SDG 10 remains strong and unwavering. Through a combination of targeted interventions, inclusive policies, and cross-cutting approaches, substantial progress has been made in reducing inequalities. However, a long road lies ahead, and AECID is dedicated to continuing its tireless work to build fairer, more inclusive, and resilient societies where no one is left behind.
