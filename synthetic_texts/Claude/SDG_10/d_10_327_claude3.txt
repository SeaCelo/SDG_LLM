The persistent challenges of inequality - within and among countries - not only undermine global progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 10 but threaten the very foundation upon which the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development rests. Israel's Agency for International Development Cooperation (MASHAV) is committed to addressing this pressing issue through targeted capacity-building initiatives, knowledge-sharing platforms, and collaborative partnerships that promote inclusive and equitable development.

MASHAV's strategic approach to reducing inequalities is underpinned by a holistic understanding of the multidimensional nature of this challenge. While income disparities are a stark manifestation, intersecting factors such as gender, age, disability, race, ethnicity, and geographic location exacerbate exclusion and marginalization. We recognize that inequality is both a cause and a consequence of deficits in areas like education, health, employment, and access to resources and opportunities.

Through our flagship program, "Pathways to Inclusion," MASHAV is working with partner countries to develop and implement comprehensive policy frameworks that prioritize the empowerment of disadvantaged groups. This initiative involves conducting in-depth assessments of existing inequalities, identifying root causes, and co-creating tailored solutions that address specific local contexts. Particular emphasis is placed on fostering an enabling environment that promotes social, economic, and political inclusion, ensuring that no one is left behind.

A cornerstone of MASHAV's efforts is the facilitation of knowledge exchange and capacity building through specialized training courses, workshops, and study tours. These platforms bring together policymakers, practitioners, and civil society representatives from across the globe to share best practices, discuss challenges, and jointly explore innovative approaches to promoting equality and non-discrimination. For instance, our recent regional workshop on "Inclusive Governance and Participatory Decision-Making" highlighted the importance of amplifying marginalized voices and ensuring their meaningful participation in development processes.

Recognizing the pivotal role of international migration in shaping inequalities, MASHAV has prioritized initiatives that facilitate safe, orderly, and regular migration pathways. Our "Migration for Development" program supports partner countries in developing effective migration policies and programs that maximize the development potential of migration while mitigating associated risks and vulnerabilities. This includes promoting ethical recruitment practices, enhancing migrant workers' rights and protections, and leveraging diaspora networks for knowledge and resource transfer.

Furthermore, MASHAV actively promotes public-private partnerships and multi-stakeholder collaborations that leverage the unique strengths and resources of diverse actors in addressing inequalities. Our "Inclusive Business Accelerator" initiative supports entrepreneurs and social enterprises in developing innovative solutions that create economic opportunities and empower marginalized communities. By facilitating access to finance, mentorship, and market linkages, we are fostering an ecosystem that promotes inclusive growth and shared prosperity.

As we strive to achieve SDG 10, MASHAV remains cognizant of the intricate interconnections between inequality and other Sustainable Development Goals. Reducing inequalities is not only a goal in itself but a catalyst for progress across the entire 2030 Agenda. By promoting inclusive and equitable development, we are simultaneously advancing efforts to eradicate poverty, achieve gender equality, promote decent work and economic growth, and foster peaceful and inclusive societies.

Looking ahead, MASHAV will continue to adapt its strategies and programs to address emerging challenges and seize new opportunities in the fight against inequality. We remain committed to leveraging Israel's expertise and innovative spirit to forge international collaborations that empower marginalized communities, dismantle systemic barriers, and create a more just and equitable world for all.
