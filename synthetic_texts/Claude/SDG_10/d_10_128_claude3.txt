Here goes, an academic article on SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities) written from the contrarian, curmudgeonly perspective of commentator Richard Littlejohn:

"Reduced Inequalities" - What a Load of Codswallop!

Right, you PC-crazed, hand-wringing, globalist lefties, I'm going to really rile you up today with my take on this "Reduced Inequalities" lark. The tenth of the UN's Sustainable Development radge-athon is one big sledgehammer to crack a nut in my book. 

Let's start with the nutty name itself - Reduced Inequalities. Not "eliminate" inequalities altogether mind, that would be going too far for our trembling Guardianistas. No, we'll just tinker around the edges, chaps, jolly good. Because let's face it, total equality is a pipe dream sold by Marxist conmen that always ends in everyone being equally impoverished. Except for the Party bigwigs living high on the hog in their dachas of course.

What even are "inequalities" anyway? The whole concept reeks of the stifling Statist desire to make everyone the same by legislating for identikit citizens. A beige, homogenized army of jobsworth drones blindly following "the Science" as dictated by their UN-IPCC-WHO overlord masters. You couldn't make it up.

Apparently these inequalities come in lots of fun flavours - income, sex, age, disability, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, origin, religion and economic/other status. It's almost like the whole human identity and experience is being pathologized into a litany of traits to be "included" or not. How very Stasi of them.

And who decides which of these inequalities needs "reducing"? By what measure? I'll give you a clue - it always favours whatever minority boutique activist cause is getting the most airtime from the hampering Islington liberals that week. Indigenous basket weavers facing systemic oppression? Chuck another few million at them from the rapidly diminishing foreign aid budget as penance for the British Empire!  

Don't get me started on the raging hypocrisy of this goal being pushed by a bloated quango made up of nation states that are among the world's worst human rights abusers and agents of inequality. From Saudi bigwigs whipping smirks to Chinese Commie tyrants loading whole ethnic populations onto cattle trains for the final solution 2.0.  

You couldn't make up the Orwellian doublespeak of countries like Zimbabwe, Venezuela and North Korea lecturing the world about reducing inequalities with a straight face. It really does take the biggest ration ofblemished hard tack.

All of this focus on "inequalities" distracts from the real drivers of deprivation around the world - corrupt, calamitous regimes; tribal division and sectarianism; lack of property rights and free markets; religious bigotry; poor education and infrastructure. But no, the UN academics and their NGO gloriziles would rather obsess over symbolic nonsense like gender-neutral berk pronouns.

Instead of tackling the real roots of global poverty with free trade, democracy and anti-corruption policies, this neo-colonialist SDG reeks of wealthy Westerners arrogantly thinking they have all the answers by throwing money at supposed inequalities. All while ignoring traditional values, religion and cultural contexts that often underpin societal cohesion for billions. 

You can't enforce equality of outcomes, no matter how many oppressive global laws get cooked up by self-flagellating social engineers at multi-billion dollar summits. Life is unfair - it's one of the glorious aspects of the rich tapestry of humanity. The sooner these utopian control freaks realize that, the sooner they can stop squandering our foreign aid budget on making themselves feel like terrific global citizens.
