As the world's largest humanitarian agency addressing hunger and promoting food security, the World Food Programme (WFP) recognizes the critical importance of reducing inequalities within and among countries to achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 10. Despite progress in some areas, persistent and systemic inequalities continue to undermine global efforts to eradicate poverty, food insecurity, and malnutrition.

Income inequality remains a significant challenge, with the richest 10% of the global population earning 40% of total income, while the poorest 10% earn only 3%. This uneven distribution of wealth creates barriers to accessing nutritious food, education, and healthcare, perpetuating the cycle of poverty and hunger. In many countries, discrimination based on gender, ethnicity, age, disability, or other factors exacerbates these disparities, limiting opportunities and marginalizing entire communities.

Climate change is also exacerbating inequalities, disproportionately affecting the poorest and most vulnerable populations. Small-scale farmers, pastoralists, and coastal communities often lack the resources and support to adapt to the impacts of extreme weather events, droughts, and rising sea levels, putting their livelihoods and food security at risk.

To address these challenges, WFP is implementing a multifaceted approach that integrates social protection programs, capacity building, and advocacy efforts. For example, our cash-based transfers and food assistance initiatives not only provide immediate relief but also promote long-term resilience by enabling households to invest in education, healthcare, and income-generating activities.

In collaboration with local partners, WFP is also working to strengthen smallholder farmers' access to markets, training, and climate-smart agricultural practices. One such initiative in Ethiopia involves establishing farmer organizations, providing technical support, and facilitating access to credit and insurance, enabling smallholders to increase their incomes and improve food security.

Recognizing the intersectionality of SDGs, WFP's efforts contribute to reducing inequalities while simultaneously supporting SDG 1 (No Poverty), SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 5 (Gender Equality), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and others. By empowering women through initiatives like cash transfers and food assistance for education, WFP is promoting gender equality and breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty and malnutrition.

However, achieving SDG 10 requires a concerted global effort involving governments, civil society, and the private sector. WFP is actively advocating for inclusive policies and equitable resource allocation, emphasizing the need for progressive taxation, social protection systems, and investments in marginalized communities.

Looking ahead, emerging technologies such as digital platforms and blockchain could revolutionize social protection programs, enabling more efficient and transparent distribution of resources while fostering financial inclusion. Additionally, WFP is exploring innovative financing mechanisms, such as impact bonds and blended finance, to mobilize resources and leverage private sector investments in reducing inequalities.

While significant challenges remain, WFP remains committed to collaborating with partners and stakeholders to create a more equitable and inclusive world, where everyone has access to the resources and opportunities necessary to live a dignified life, free from hunger and poverty.
