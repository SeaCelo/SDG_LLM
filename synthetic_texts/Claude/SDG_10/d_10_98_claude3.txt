Here is a draft academic article on SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities) as if written by the Indian journalist and author Tavleen Singh:

Reducing Inequalities Within and Among Countries: A Tragic Paradox of Modern India

As someone who has chronicled the paradoxes of India for decades, few ironies cut deeper than the nation's colossal and growing inequalities in the modern era. Despite unprecedented economic growth that has catapulted millions out of poverty, inequality has metastasized, both within our borders and compared to other nations. This sobering reality stands in stark defiance of the principles enshrined in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 10 which demands reduced inequalities. 

India's chasmic income disparities are among the highest globally, a damning indictment of the detached opulence that has accompanied our economic ascent. The top 1% of the population now holds over 40% of the nation's wealth, while the bottom 50% subsists on a mere 3% share. This staggering divide renders idle the celebratory rhetoric so frequently invoked, presenting instead an uglier truth - that India's fabled growth has disproportionately benefited a select elite while leaving the majority in a perpetual underclass.

The malignant effects transcend mere income, manifesting in obscene imbalances across health, education, gender parity and more. In the hinterlands, malnutrition and preventable disease persist unabated, a reality unimaginable amidst the indulgent affluence radiating from our glittering metropolises. Likewise, while India's economic engines have spawned a thriving knowledge class, millions of children remain deprioritized, their minds left stunted by the compounding disadvantages that adhere to poverty.

Tragically, such disparities do not spare even the most fundamental human rights. Gender discrimination still rages unimpeded, the nation's daughters routinely denied the opportunities accorded their brothers. One need look no further than our crisis of female foeticide and the alarming decline of the sex ratio as devastating proof.  

Perhaps most corrosive is how inequality has calcified into permanent, multi-generational handicaps impeding entire communities. The Divides of caste, religion, geography and more have hardened into immutable fortresses, systematically denying those trapped on the wrong side any prospects of upward socioeconomic mobility. Successive generations, damned to relive the deprivations of their forebears.  

Beyond our internal fractures, India's meteoric rise has created towering imbalances on the global scale as well. As our GDP has swelled, so too has our ecological excess, our prodigious consumption of resources outstripping the carbon footprints of many nations combined. Even as we decry the excesses of the West, our own bingeing imperils the planet for all. And while our cities glitter with newfound affluence, our neighbors in South Asia and Africa languish in conditions increasingly discrepant from our own.

Some proclaim these inequities as lamentable but inevitable growing pains, transitory troubles that continuous economic growth will inevitably resolve. I reject such myopic delusion. The lessons from history are unambiguous - that unchecked inequalities catalyze social unrest, breed conflict, erode human capital and ultimately undermine economic and political stability. A house divided against itself cannot stand.

No, the path forward lies in concerted interventions that re-distribute resources, re-calibrate incentives, and re-invest in the most vulnerable and disadvantaged segments of society. Universal healthcare, revitalized education, empowered gender parity and concerted community development must become paramount national priorities. Parallel measures are needed globally in partnership with other nations.  

Only by wrestling our grotesque inequalities to the ground can we extinguish the simmering powder keg that ultimately threatens to immolate our nation's promise. For if we fail to lift the bottom quintile, India's much-vaunted rise will collapse into a fleeting mirage, a boom repeatedly doomed by our abandonment of the masses. The choice is stark - either uphold the ideals of an inclusive, equitable society, or succumb to endless cycles of internal combustion.

The road will be arduous, replete with powerful vested interests hellbent on obstructing reform. But we must persevere, mustering the political courage to reforge our social compact. The alternative is a future bereaved of hope, repudiation of our founding vision, and condemning ourselves to perpetual strife.

Reducing inequalities is thus not merely a moral or ethical imperative, but an existential one - a struggle that will define whether India's destiny is to become a true global great power, or a brutally shattered husk. For that reason above all others, SDG 10 is not peripheral - it is central to reclaiming the soul of my beloved nation.
