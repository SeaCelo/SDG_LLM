Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities) from the perspective of Jonah Goldberg:

The Folly of Eliminating Inequality through Coercion and Collectivism

By Jonah Goldberg 

The 10th Sustainable Development Goal posits the lofty aim of "reducing inequalities" through various policy prescriptions focused on economic redistribution and social leveling. However, this agenda rests on a series of flawed philosophical and economic assumptions that are fundamentally at odds with the principles of a free society.

At its core, the push to eliminate inequality relies on the collectivist conceit that wealth and resources can be centrally planned and socially engineered to a predetermined, equal distribution without disastrous consequences. This hubristic notion stems from the erroneous belief that economies and societies are simply inert substances to be molded by the paternalistic state according to its desired egalitarian Blueprint.

This top-down dream of radical equity downplays or outright ignores the indispensable role of human enterprise, innovation, creativity, and the propulsive force of competitive markets in generating wealth and prosperity. Throughout history, the most effective way to raise overall living standards has been through the bottom-up cultivation of economic freedom, property rights, and the rule of law - not elite diktat from planners striving for a chimerical egalitarian vision.

The SDG's policy agenda calls for aggressive income and wealth redistribution through confiscatory taxation, government transfers, and other coercive means. Yet such mandatory economic leveling serves only to erode the incentives for productive behavior, entrepreneurial risk-taking, and capital investment that are the true wellsprings of broad-based prosperity.

Ultimately, the state cannot equitably divide a stagnant or shrinking economic pie; it can only take from some to give to others in a zero- or negative-sum game. History's grimmest totalitarian regimes were all born of radical egalitarian ideologies that sought to stamp out inequality through brute force rather than nurture the conditions for a rising tide to lift all boats.

A candid look at countries with aggressive redistribution policies shows they tend to suffer from anemic economic growth, declining competitiveness, crippling tax burdens, unsustainable welfare costs, demographic stagnation, and a sclerotic culture of entitlement and dependence. Liberties and economic dynamism are inseparable; where governments assault the former, the latter inevitably withers.

Rather than striving for absolute equality of outcomes – an impossibility absent full-blown totalitarianism – a flourishing society should focus on maintaining a robust framework of fair rules, equal rights under the law, portable benefits that don't trap people in dependency, and removing cronyist privileges that rig the system toward entrenched insiders. Equality of opportunity, not state-ordained equity of results, should be the objective.

Income stratification and socioeconomic divides are complex phenomena intertwined with multifarious cultural, geographic, and historical factors. Simplistic redistributionism ignores these intricate realities and fallaciously treats inequality as a decontextualized affliction to be remedied through crude material equalization. Such a blinkered approach is a formula for stoking societal unrest, crippling human capital formation, and immiserating the masses through resource depletion and adverse incentives.

Poverty persists not because of inequality per se, but due to policies that impede economic growth and personal empowerment. Striving to impose an artificial sameness ignores the infinite diversity of human talents and ambitions that drive social and economic dynamism. A stultifying parity will leave the masses impoverished in a repressive morass of gray socialism, rather than empowered participants in a vibrant and progressing civilization.

The quest for radical equality is chasing a mirage, born of envy, hubris, and contempt for the infinitely complex spontaneous orders arising from voluntary human cooperation in the marketplace and civil society. Rather than succumb to this siren call, mankind's energies should focus on unleashing prosperity through economic liberation and embracing the wondrous pluralism of uncoerced people pursuing their myriad strivings.
