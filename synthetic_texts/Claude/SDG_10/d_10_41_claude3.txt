Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities) from the perspective of Piers Akerman, a conservative Australian political commentator:

The Utopian Crusade of the UN's Inequality Agenda

By Piers Akerman, Honorary Professor of Common Sense

The lofty ideals enshrined in the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 10 to "reduce inequality within and among countries" should be seen for what they truly are - a thinly veiled socialist crusade to undermine national sovereignty and impose a radical egalitarian agenda upon liberal democracies. The neoliberal dogma permeating this goal is hardly a surprise coming from the bloated, unaccountable UN bureaucracy headquartered in that den of moral relativism, Manhattan.

The basic premise that inequality is inherently bad and must be eradicated through top-down interventionism is deeply flawed. Inequality is not only natural and inevitable in any meritocratic system, but a vital incentive that rewards innovation, hard work, and entrepreneurial risk-taking - the very drivers of economic growth and societal advancement. The leftist social engineers pushing SDG 10 conveniently ignore how free market capitalism has lifted billions out of poverty worldwide.  

Rather than embracing the UN's draconian vision of enforced "equality of outcome," we should celebrate the inequalities that result from people's differing talents, motivations and life choices in free societies. From professional athletes and musical virtuosos to technological pioneers and titans of industry - is society really better off actively undermining the exceptional to install a homogenized mediocrity? The demoralizing and stifling effects of that dystopian thinking should be abhorrent to any freedom-loving citizen.

Any reasonable society will of course have measures to provide a basic social safety net and opportunities for upward mobility based on merit. But the interventionist policies urged by SDG 10 go far beyond that, calling for discriminatory "affirmative action" schemes, economically ruinous wealth redistribution through punitive taxes, open borders policies to enable unrestricted migration, and a raft of other draconian measures seemingly designed to erode self-determination and national coherence.

We've seen time and again how such radical policies championed by cultural Marxists lead to productive citizens being fleeced of the fruits of their labor while democratically-governed nations are plunged into debt, social discord and economic malaise. Ask the long-suffering citizens of Venezuela, Greece or the countless other ill-fated nations that embraced this failed ideology.

It's no coincidence that the greatest wealth creation, innovation, social mobility and overall human advancement in modern history occurred through the spontaneous order of decentralized free market capitalism - not the suffocating hand of utopian interventionism. Nations wishing to uplift their populace securely should look to enable economic freedom, protect private property rights, encourage self-determination and reward entrepreneurial vigor. Those are the timeless principles that foster thriving societies, not the divisive and coercive dictates found in SDG 10.  

Prudent policymakers would do well to consign the UN's inequality agenda to the ideological compost heap of failed collectivist experiments from a bygone era. For the fallacy underpinning this quixotic crusade is the mistaken belief that centralized planners can fairly and effectively engineer superior outcomes compared to the evolutionary dynamics of dispersed liberal democracies. As any student of history knows, that path leads only to the impoverishment of the human condition. We deserve a future of freedom, opportunity and merit-based ascendancy - not the flawed fantasy of imposed egalitarianism.
