Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities) from the perspective of Tina Dupuy:

Income inequality is one of the greatest threats to social cohesion and sustainable development that we face today. The 10th Sustainable Development Goal seeks to "reduce inequality within and among countries," which seems like a fairly straightforward and laudable objective. However, the harsh reality is that inequality has reached staggering heights and continues to worsen at an alarming rate despite stated commitments to address the issue. 

The statistics lay bare the grotesque imbalance in our world's distribution of resources and opportunities. The richest 1% now owns more wealth than the rest of the global population combined. Just think about that for a moment - a tiny sliver of ultra-high net worth individuals have managed to amass greater fortunes than 7.5 billion people collectively. This is the outcome of an economic system that prioritizes greed, exploitation, and consolidation of power over any semblance of fairness or human decency.

What's even more infuriating is that the drivers of inequality are multifaceted and deeply entrenched in the very fabric of our societies. Regressive tax policies, discriminatory practices, inadequate access to education and healthcare, and the disproportionate influence of monied interests all serve to perpetuate disparities across lines of income, gender, race, disability status and other marginalized identities. Intersecting and compounding forms of discrimination only exacerbate cycles of disadvantage.

We tout freedom and opportunity as core tenets of our civilization, yet how can we honestly claim to uphold those values when millions are systematically denied their fair share? What good are civil liberties if a person's potential is suffocated from birth by environmental injustice, substandard public services, and unequal economic prospects? This status quo is anathema to principles of human rights and social justice.

Perhaps most egregiously, inequality breeds resentment, strife, crime, and instability that ultimately harm both the privileged and underserved alike. As the divides grow deeper, so too do the fault lines that threaten our collective wellbeing and security. Environmental degradation, pandemics, migration crises - all can be traced back to disparities that fray the bonds holding society together.

Achieving SDG 10 requires wholesale restructuring of our economic architecture via progressive taxation, stronger social safety nets, workers' rights, accessible public services, and concerted efforts to dismantle systemic biases. Voluntary corporate initiatives like "ethical supply chains" are toothless half-measures that allow injustices to persist by making us feel better without making substantive sacrifices.  

We require a paradigm shift in values that prioritizes distribution over accumulation, cooperation over competition, and human dignity over shareholder returns. As long as overconsumption by a few at the expense of many remains an accepted practice, goals of reducing inequality will ring hollow and our path to a more equitable world will be obstructed.

Uncomfortable truths must be confronted head-on. Attempting to redress inequalities through tinkering around the edges is both futile and counterproductive. Uncomfortable as it may be, we must critically examine the dysfunctional underlying incentives, power structures, and zero-sum mindsets that systematically produce such distorted outcomes in the first place. Only then can we forge sustainable solutions for an inclusive global community to thrive.
