In our ongoing mission to alleviate human suffering and uphold human dignity, the International Red Cross recognizes the pivotal role of Sustainable Development Goal 10 (SDG 10) in reducing inequalities within and among countries. As a humanitarian organization operating at the frontlines of global crises, we bear witness to the devastating consequences of unchecked inequality â€“ from the perpetuation of poverty and marginalization to the exacerbation of conflicts and displacement.

Addressing inequality is not merely an ethical imperative but also a strategic necessity for achieving sustainable development and fostering resilient, inclusive societies. Inequality manifests in various forms, including income disparities, unequal access to resources and opportunities, discrimination based on gender, race, ethnicity, or disability, and the marginalization of vulnerable groups such as refugees, migrants, and indigenous populations.

The COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed and amplified existing inequalities, disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable segments of society. According to the United Nations, the crisis could push an additional 207 million people into extreme poverty by 2030, reversing decades of progress in poverty reduction. Moreover, the pandemic has highlighted the stark disparities in access to healthcare, social protection, and digital technologies, further exacerbating the divide between the haves and the have-nots.

Tackling inequality requires a multifaceted approach that addresses its root causes and systemic barriers. One crucial aspect is promoting inclusive and equitable economic growth through policies that foster decent work opportunities, fair wages, and social protection systems. Enhancing access to quality education, vocational training, and lifelong learning opportunities is also crucial for breaking the cycle of intergenerational poverty and empowering individuals to participate fully in economic and social spheres.

Furthermore, combating discrimination and promoting inclusive societies is paramount. This entails challenging harmful social norms, stereotypes, and biases that perpetuate exclusion and marginalization. It also necessitates adopting comprehensive anti-discrimination laws and policies that protect the rights of vulnerable groups and promote their active participation in decision-making processes.

Achieving SDG 10 also requires addressing the unique challenges faced by specific groups, such as refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs). These populations often face multiple layers of vulnerability, including displacement, loss of livelihoods, and limited access to essential services. Ensuring their integration into host communities, providing access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities, and promoting social cohesion are critical steps toward addressing their unique needs and promoting their inclusion.

Moreover, reducing inequality extends beyond national borders, as global disparities in wealth, resources, and power dynamics contribute to perpetuating cycles of poverty and instability. Promoting fair and equitable trade practices, facilitating technology transfer, and addressing the adverse impacts of climate change on developing nations are essential components of a comprehensive global approach to reducing inequalities.

The International Red Cross, through its vast network of national societies and partnerships with governments, international organizations, and civil society, is well-positioned to play a pivotal role in advancing SDG 10. Our humanitarian operations, advocacy efforts, and capacity-building initiatives across various contexts exemplify our commitment to addressing inequalities and promoting inclusive societies.

For instance, our response to the Syrian crisis has not only provided lifesaving assistance to those affected but also focused on fostering social cohesion and promoting the inclusion of refugees and IDPs in host communities. Through initiatives such as vocational training, livelihoods support, and community-based protection programs, we aim to empower these vulnerable groups, reduce tensions, and promote their active participation in social and economic spheres.

Furthermore, our engagement in conflict-affected regions, such as the Lake Chad Basin and the Sahel, underscores our commitment to addressing the multidimensional drivers of inequality, including poverty, environmental degradation, and lack of access to essential services. By adopting a holistic approach that combines humanitarian assistance with long-term resilience-building efforts, we strive to address the root causes of vulnerability and promote sustainable solutions.

In collaboration with various stakeholders, including governments, international organizations, and local communities, we advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusive societies, combat discrimination, and ensure equal access to resources and opportunities. Our role as an auxiliary to public authorities allows us to influence decision-making processes and promote the adoption of inclusive and equitable measures.

As we navigate the complex challenges posed by rising inequalities, the International Red Cross remains steadfast in its commitment to upholding the principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality, and independence. By leveraging our global presence, operational expertise, and principled approach, we strive to be a catalyst for positive change, fostering inclusive and resilient societies where no one is left behind.

In conclusion, achieving SDG 10 is not merely a development goal but a fundamental prerequisite for realizing a more just, peaceful, and prosperous world. Through our collective efforts and unwavering commitment to reducing inequalities, we can create a future where every individual has the opportunity to thrive, regardless of their circumstances or backgrounds.
