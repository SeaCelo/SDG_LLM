Here is a detailed draft academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities) as if written by Ross Levine, an expert on inequality and development:

Inequalities Within and Among Countries: The Imperative of SDG 10

The persistence of inequalities within and across countries represents one of the greatest impediments to sustained economic prosperity and societal well-being in the modern era. Although capitalism has catalyzed an unprecedented expansion of the global economic pie over recent centuries, the spoils have been boundlessly mal-distributed – both within the major economic powers and between the world's affluent and impoverished precincts. This egregious and debilitating inequality of conditions manifests in multifarious dimensions: disparities in wealth, resources, opportunities, political voice, and foundational human capacities such as education, health, and social mobility.

The corrosive effects of inequality on human development are clear, compelling, and robustly documented. Pervasive inequalities foster social unrest, undermine institutional integrity, attenuate incentives for productive investment, and immiserate those trapped in deprivation. Furthermore, inequality begets more inequality through vicious, self-reinforcing cycles: entrenched inequities concentrate economic and political power, which then further privileges the privileged through legislative capture, regulatory distortions, monopolistic dynamics, and more. In essence, excessive inequalities erode the very economic and civic foundations required for genuinely inclusive, democratic capitalism to thrive.

SDG 10 represents an emphatic call to "reduce inequality within and among countries." Laudably, this agenda identifies inequality as a cross-cutting issue intertwined with virtually every other major developmental priority – eradicating poverty, achieving food security, promoting gender equality, providing quality education, ensuring decent work prospects, catalyzing sustainable economic growth, and more. Virtually all desirable developmental outcomes become more tenable and self-sustaining when constructed upon more egalitarian societal foundations.

Yet the challenges to meaningfully reducing inequalities can seem daunting. Deeply entrenched socioeconomic forces, elite capture of governance structures, structural impediments to more equitable resource distribution, and other obstacles stand in opposition. Success will hinge on decisive, multi-pronged actions targeting inequalities from manifold angles.  

Domestic policy reform represents a crucial battleground. Crafting more sharply progressive tax codes, dismantling distortionary regulatory barriers to market entry, reinvigorating antitrust vigilance and enforcement, investing heavily in human capital accumulation, and strengthening social safety nets all warrant prioritization. Globally, renegotiating intellectual property rights regimes, stabilizing migration policies, intensifying capacity-building efforts for low-income states, alleviating crushing debt loads, and calibrating trade arrangements for more inclusive outcomes will all be pivotal. 

Moreover, a crucial determinant of success will be grassroots movements demanding more equitable sociopolitical orders. History's underclasses have never freely received the full fruits of equity – these laurels must be seized through collective action, civic mobilization, and sustained campaigns to remake the structural foundations of national and global orders. From Solidarność to the Arab Spring, impassioned mass movements have catalyzed seismic shifts for greater egalitarianism.

Reining in inequalities is both an ethical and strategic developmental imperative – excessive inequities calcify into institutionalized injustice, threaten sociopolitical stability, hollow out economic dynamism, and impose staggering human costs. By contrast, more equitable societies tend to be more productive, vibrant, cohesive, secure, and prosperous over the long-term. Advancing SDG 10 thus represents nothing less than a struggle to rekindle faith in the quintessential developmental promise – enabling all people, regardless of circumstances of birth, to flourish and achieve their full human potentials.
