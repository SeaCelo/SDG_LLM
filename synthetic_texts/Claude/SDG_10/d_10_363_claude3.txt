As the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, our commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is unwavering, and we recognize the critical importance of SDG 10: Reducing Inequalities. This goal lies at the heart of our mission to foster inclusive and sustainable economic growth across our regions of operation.

Despite the remarkable progress made in recent decades, global inequality remains a persistent and multifaceted challenge. Economic disparities, social exclusion, and unequal access to opportunities continue to hinder human development and undermine societal cohesion. Addressing these inequalities is not only a moral imperative but also a strategic necessity for ensuring long-term economic prosperity and social stability.

Our analysis reveals a complex interplay of factors contributing to inequality within and across nations. Income inequality, driven by unequal distributions of wealth, wages, and access to productive assets, remains a significant barrier to shared prosperity. However, inequality extends beyond economic dimensions, manifesting in disparities in education, health, and access to essential services, often exacerbated by gender, ethnicity, disability, and other markers of social stratification.

Furthermore, the rise of the digital economy and technological advancements have brought both opportunities and challenges. While digital technologies have the potential to democratize access to information and services, the digital divide risks further exacerbating existing inequalities, leaving marginalized communities behind in an increasingly digitalized world.

Climate change and environmental degradation also disproportionately impact vulnerable populations, exacerbating existing inequalities and creating new challenges for sustainable development. The consequences of climate-related events, such as natural disasters, droughts, and resource scarcity, often hit the poorest and most marginalized communities the hardest, perpetuating cycles of poverty and vulnerability.

To address these multifaceted challenges, we must adopt a comprehensive and multidimensional approach that recognizes the interconnectedness of various forms of inequality. Our strategy focuses on three key pillars: promoting inclusive economic growth, fostering social inclusion, and strengthening institutional capacity.

Inclusive economic growth is essential for reducing income inequality and creating opportunities for all. We support policies and investments that promote decent work, entrepreneurship, and access to productive resources, particularly for marginalized groups. Our initiatives focus on enhancing access to finance, improving infrastructure, and fostering skills development to empower individuals and communities to participate fully in economic activities.

Social inclusion is critical for addressing non-economic dimensions of inequality. We prioritize investments in inclusive and equitable quality education, accessible healthcare, and sustainable housing solutions. By breaking down barriers to essential services and promoting equal opportunities, we aim to combat discrimination, empower disadvantaged groups, and foster social cohesion.

Strengthening institutional capacity is vital for ensuring the effective implementation and sustainability of inequality reduction measures. We collaborate with governments, civil society organizations, and private sector partners to enhance governance frameworks, promote transparency and accountability, and build resilient and inclusive institutions. This includes supporting legislative reforms, capacity-building initiatives, and data collection efforts to inform evidence-based policymaking.

Our approach is guided by a commitment to leave no one behind, ensuring that our interventions reach the most vulnerable and marginalized populations. We recognize the intersectionality of inequalities and tailor our strategies to address the unique challenges faced by different groups, such as women, youth, persons with disabilities, and indigenous communities.

Moreover, we emphasize the importance of participatory processes and stakeholder engagement, ensuring that the voices of marginalized groups are heard and their perspectives inform our decision-making. By fostering inclusive dialogue and collaboration, we aim to build ownership, enhance accountability, and strengthen the sustainability of our interventions.

In our pursuit of SDG 10, we acknowledge the complex and interconnected nature of inequalities and the need for collaborative and coordinated efforts. We actively engage with international organizations, civil society, and the private sector to leverage synergies, share knowledge, and catalyze collective action towards reducing inequalities within and across countries.

As we navigate the challenges ahead, we remain steadfast in our commitment to promoting inclusive and sustainable development. By addressing inequalities in their multidimensional forms, we pave the way for more resilient, prosperous, and just societies, where no one is left behind.
