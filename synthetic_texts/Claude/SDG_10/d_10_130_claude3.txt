Here is a detailed academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities) written from the perspective of Matthew Parris, the British journalist and former conservative politician:

Inequality - The Rot at the Core of the Development Agenda

By Matthew Parris

The great moral failing of the human race in our age is our inability - no, our unwillingness - to grapple honestly with inequalities of income and opportunity, both within nations and between them. We parade our concerns for the poor, the dispossessed and the disadvantaged, but in reality we jealously guard the advantages that accrue to us by accident of birth. Our declared goals of "leaving no one behind" are hollow shams, betraying the reality that even among those professing concerns for human progress, only a small minority are prepared to pursue the thorough-going equalization that true ethics demands.

The 10th Sustainable Development Goal speaks to "reduced inequalities" but accepts the perpetuation of an unjust global order by calling merely for "facilitating orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration", rather than opening borders entirely. Its targets for empowering the disadvantaged are vague and unenforceable. There are no hard deadlines or transfer mechanisms to reduce disparities to acceptable levels.  

The SDGs overall, shaped by political compromises between wealthy and developing nations, perpetuate the primacy of the nation-state and the protection of elite privileges within each country. By striving only for relative poverty reduction rather than equity across borders, the SDGs condemn billions to preventable disadvantage for the sake of the comforts and entrenched supremacy of a rapacious global elite.

If we are to take the concept of human rights seriously, arbitrary inequalities become indefensible in principle. The claim that sacrificing privilege is too high a price for ensuring all newborn infants enter the world with similar life chances is nothing more than philosophical evasion wrapped in shallow utilitarianism.

The Rawlsian philosophical injunction to make social policy as if one had entered the world with a random reassignment of status is the only ethical stance truly compatible with respect for universal human dignity.  Anything less perpetuates a global system of arbitrarily-assigned victors and losers based on immutable characteristics of birth.

We may avert our gaze, but principles of moral philosophy are clear. Either we embrace equal human dignity and reorganize society to reflect that truth, or we consign billions to injustice. Tinkering around the margins through halfhearted development policies is an exercise in self-delusion that serves primarily to assuage the liberal conscience.

Serious thinkers of the Enlightenment understood this conundrum and many flirted with elaborating theoretical schemes of global economic and political integration under which all would be assured equal basic rights. Figures as diverse as Immanuel Kant, the Marquis de Condorcet and (on his daysgodless optimism) even the perpetually dissatisfiedJean-Jacques Rousseau grasped the necessity of universality in ethics. What they lacked were the technological and economic means to realize their expansive ideals.

We possess those means today but lack the moral courage and political will to implement them. It is a crime against human conscience that with agriculture, medicine, digital communications and automated production capacities that could banish scarcity forever, we instead acquiesce to mindless perpetuation of disparities.

True sustainable development is impossible without a complete rethinking and restructuring of systems of human organization to equalize opportunities across the artifice of national borders.  The rising tide of reactionary nationalisms merely highlights the desperation with which entrenched power elites cling to their prerogatives.

We stand at a philosophical crossroads. Either we will take seriously the maxim that "all men are created equal" as a self-evident truth to translate into action, or we will cement the divisions and inequities of history to create a world of mindless Orwellian perpetuity of injustice. 

Those voices calling for incrementalism and small, voluntary steps to modestly reduce disparities betray the moral urgency of the moment. Anything less than a rigorous, enforceable framework for the total redistribution of resources is unacceptable, no matter how discomfiting the upheaval.

The Sustainable Development Goals represent a failure of moral vision and tenacity. Their milquetoast provisions will accomplish incremental nothings while deferring the urgencies of ethical action into a nebulous future of continued indignity for the world's most vulnerable. We can and must do better. Posterity will not forgive our self-indulgent moral capitulations.
