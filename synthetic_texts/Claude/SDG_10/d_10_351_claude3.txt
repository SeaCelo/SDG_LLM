Thailand International Cooperation Agency (TICA) recognizes the intrinsic link between reducing inequalities and sustainable development, as outlined in the Sustainable Development Goal 10 (SDG 10). Our analysis highlights the multifaceted nature of inequalities, encompassing income disparities, social exclusion, and unequal access to resources and opportunities within and among countries.

At the global level, the persistent and widening gap between the richest and poorest nations remains a significant challenge. Despite concerted efforts, the income inequality ratio for developing countries has increased, indicating a disproportionate concentration of wealth and resources. This disparity not only undermines economic growth but also hinders social cohesion and exacerbates conflicts.

Within Thailand, we observe disparities in income distribution, with the top 20% of the population accounting for a substantial share of the national income. This inequality is exacerbated by regional disparities, with urban centers experiencing higher levels of economic development and access to services compared to rural areas. Additionally, certain demographic groups, including women, ethnic minorities, and persons with disabilities, face systemic barriers to equal opportunities in education, employment, and political representation.

TICA acknowledges the critical role of inclusive and equitable policies in addressing these inequalities. Our initiatives prioritize the empowerment of marginalized communities through targeted interventions, such as skill development programs, access to microfinance, and capacity-building for small and medium enterprises. We collaborate with local governments and civil society organizations to ensure that these efforts are tailored to the specific needs and contexts of each community.

Furthermore, TICA recognizes the importance of promoting inclusive and equitable trade policies, as well as facilitating safe and regular migration channels. By supporting fair labor practices and protecting the rights of migrant workers, we aim to reduce economic inequalities and promote decent work opportunities for all.

In the realm of fiscal and social policies, TICA advocates for progressive taxation systems and effective redistribution mechanisms to ensure a more equitable distribution of wealth and resources. We also prioritize investments in quality education, healthcare, and social protection programs, enabling equal access to essential services and empowering individuals to break the cycle of poverty.

Additionally, TICA emphasizes the need for inclusive governance and decision-making processes. By promoting participatory mechanisms and ensuring the representation of marginalized groups in policymaking, we strive to address the root causes of inequalities and foster sustainable and equitable development.

Addressing inequalities is a multifaceted endeavor that requires concerted efforts across various sectors and stakeholders. TICA remains committed to fostering partnerships and collaborations with government agencies, civil society organizations, and the private sector, both domestically and internationally, to accelerate progress towards the achievement of SDG 10 and the broader Sustainable Development Agenda.
