Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities) as if written by economist John List:

Inequality is one of the most pressing challenges facing the modern world. As we advance technologically and economically, the gaps between the haves and have-nots only seem to widen. This fissure represents more than just a moral failing - it is a threat to global stability, prosperity and human welfare. The 10th Sustainable Development Goal laid out by the United Nations seeks to "reduce inequality within and among countries." Achieving this goal is both an economic imperative and an ethical calling.  

My research has shown that inequality can act as a drag on economic growth and development. When a society's resources are concentrated among a small elite class, it constrains overall economic output and productivity. Human capital goes underutilized, as talented individuals lack the opportunities to apply their skills. Consumer demand remains suppressed due to limited purchasing power among the masses. And investment capital pools in the hands of a few, rather than being deployed more broadly to fund innovation and new industry creation.

Beyond these economic impacts, inequality also breeds social unrest, crime, political instability and conflict. A populace that sees no path to prosperity and dignity will inevitably begin to question the legitimacy of the system and ruling powers. As inequality reaches extremes, revolutionary conditions can take hold. From the French Revolution to the Russian Revolution to the Arab Spring, history is littered with examples of popular uprisings triggered by disparities in wealth, rights and influence. Keeping inequalities in check is key to maintaining social cohesion.

To get a grip on the scale of this challenge, consider that the 26 richest individuals in the world currently possess as much wealth as the poorest 50% of the global population combined. This is not a sustainable state of affairs. It represents a gross injustice, a squandering of human potential, and a recipe for upheaval if allowed to persist.  

Making progress on SDG 10 will require a multi-faceted effort targeting inequality through smarter policies and committed global partnerships. Concrete steps should include:

Improving access to education and skills training, especially for underrepresented groups like women, minorities and the rural poor. Human capital is the most powerful engine for social mobility.

Implementing more progressive tax policies to redistribute wealth and funding for public services. Marginal tax rates on the highest incomes should rise.

Strengthening social safety nets and supportive services like childcare to provide ladders out of poverty.

Promoting organized labor and strengthening worker rights to combat the disproportionate gains made by owners of capital over labor. 

Advancing economic diversification in developing economies to create a broader distribution of employment opportunities.

Leveraging foreign aid and development assistance more strategically to focus on inequality reduction in recipient nations.

These are just some of the levers we must pull in service of SDG 10. But beyond policy prescriptions, we also need a broader ideological shift to reframe society's ethos around the values of equity, inclusion and shared prosperity. Greed and unchecked self-interest have been allowed to become the sine qua non of modern capitalism. We require a moral reawakening to the primacy of human dignity and the common good.

The path will not be easy, as entrenched wealth and power always fight ardently to preserve their privileges. But the economic and social costs of allowing inequality to fester are simply too severe to be ignored. Aspiring to shared prosperity and rejecting extreme material divides is both ethical economics and realpolitik. It is a matter of protecting the sustainability of our way of life.

SDG 10 must become a clarion call for our era. Reducing inequality is not just a noble humanitarian ideal - it is an existential necessity if we hope to cultivate a more just, stable and prosperous world. The work starts here, and it starts now.
