Reducing Inequality Within and Among Countries: An Examination of the Sustainable Development Goal 10 through the Lens of Accounting and Economics

The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 10, which aims to "reduce inequality within and among countries," has far-reaching implications for the field of accounting and economics. This goal recognizes that persistent and increasing inequalities pose a significant threat to sustainable development, economic growth, and social cohesion. As such, it is imperative to examine the role of accounting and economic practices in perpetuating or mitigating these disparities.

At the heart of SDG 10 lies the recognition that inequality manifests itself in various forms, including income, wealth, opportunities, and access to resources. These disparities are often exacerbated by structural barriers, discriminatory practices, and ineffective policies and regulations. The accounting and economic disciplines play a crucial role in shaping the distribution of resources, wealth, and income, making their scrutiny and reform a fundamental component of achieving this goal.

One area of focus for accounting and economics is the measurement and reporting of inequality. Traditional metrics, such as the Gini coefficient and income quintile ratios, have long been used to quantify income inequality. However, these measures often fail to capture the multidimensional nature of inequality, including disparities in wealth, access to education, healthcare, and other essential services. There is a need for more comprehensive and nuanced indicators that reflect the complex and intersectional nature of inequality, enabling policymakers and stakeholders to develop targeted interventions.

Moreover, accounting practices play a pivotal role in shaping the distribution of corporate profits, taxation, and the allocation of resources. The application of Transfer Pricing principles, for instance, can have significant implications for the distribution of income and wealth among countries, potentially exacerbating global inequalities. Similarly, the adoption of aggressive tax avoidance strategies by multinational corporations can erode the tax base of developing nations, undermining their ability to invest in public services and infrastructure that are essential for reducing inequalities.

Economic policies and theories also have a profound impact on inequality. Neoclassical economic models, which often assume perfect competition and the efficient allocation of resources, may overlook the structural barriers and market failures that perpetuate inequalities. Alternative economic paradigms, such as inclusive growth and heterodox theories, offer valuable perspectives on addressing the root causes of inequality, including power imbalances, market concentration, and the uneven distribution of resources.

Furthermore, the integration of environmental and social considerations into accounting and economic decision-making processes is crucial for achieving SDG 10. The pursuit of narrow economic objectives, without regard for their broader societal impacts, can exacerbate inequalities and undermine sustainable development. Accounting frameworks that incorporate environmental and social externalities, such as natural capital accounting and integrated reporting, can help align economic activities with broader societal goals and promote more equitable outcomes.

In conclusion, the Sustainable Development Goal 10 represents a clarion call for the accounting and economics disciplines to critically examine their roles in perpetuating or mitigating inequalities. By embracing innovative measurement approaches, reforming corporate practices, and integrating broader societal considerations into decision-making processes, these fields can contribute significantly to reducing inequalities within and among countries. Ultimately, achieving this goal requires a paradigm shift that prioritizes inclusive growth, sustainable development, and the equitable distribution of resources and opportunities across societies.
