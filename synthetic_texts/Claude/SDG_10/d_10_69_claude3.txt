Here is a detailed, comprehensive academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities), written from the perspective of Heather Mallick:

Inequalities Entrenched: An Intersectional Critique of SDG 10 and Neoliberal Development Paradigms

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has rightly identified rising inequalities as one of the greatest challenges facing our turbulent world. Sustainable Development Goal 10 laudably calls for reducing inequalities within and among countries. Yet this facially progressive objective is fundamentally undermined by the United Nations' continued deference to the neoliberal economic orthodoxy promoted by wealthy nations and corporate interests.

At its core, SDG 10 represents an attempt to ameliorate the most egregious manifestations of inequality while leaving the structural roots intact. The goal's associated targets include promoting inclusive social, economic and political policies; facilitating orderly migration; and empowering developing countries through greater representation in global governance institutions. While worthwhile in isolation, these limited remedies fail to wrestle with neoliberalism's innate propensity to concentrate wealth and power.

The dominant development model imposed by the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and corporate globalization has systematically stripped developing nations of economic sovereignty. Harsh austerity programs and market fundamentalism have eviscerated the social safety nets required to uplift the world's most vulnerable populations. Rampant privatization of public goods and services has rendered them inaccessible to those mired in poverty. Deregulation has emboldened multinational corporations to engage in rapacious resource extraction, labor exploitation, and environmental degradation with impunity.

This insidious paradigm perpetuates the vicious cycle of underdevelopment while securing a steady influx of cheap labor and resources for the enrichment of the global North. Far from uplifting the world's poor through the rising tide of unrestrained capitalism, neoliberal policies have constructed intricate systems of oppression that exacerbate inequalities across every conceivable axis.

An intersectional analytical lens reveals how inequalities are experienced and compounded at the confluence of race, gender, class, disability status, sexuality, and other dimensions of identity and systemic disadvantage. Indigenous populations face existential threats by defending their sovereign lands against corporate land grabs facilitated by neoliberal market reforms. Women in the developing world are brutalized by income inequality, gender discrimination, lack of access to education and healthcare, and vulnerability to poverty and violence. The LGBTQ+ community endures criminalization, social stigma, and exclusion from economic opportunities in many nations. Working class movements resisting austerity and privatization are met with violent repression.

SDG 10 remains hamstrung by its reluctance to challenge this entrenched system of oppression. Widespread ratification of International Labor Organization conventions, enforcing a binding UN convention against corporate human rights abuses, and rejecting the indefensible Investor-State Dispute Settlement system would represent initial positive steps. However, a truly transformative vision of sustainable, equitable development requires the democratization of global economic governance and a paradigm shift away from neoliberal capitalism.

The current world order has constructed a rigid hierarchy based on white, Western, wealthy nation-state hegemony and corporate domination. Uplifting the world's most oppressed and marginalized populations necessitates dismantling these power structures and epistemic foundations in solidarity with the Global South. Decolonizing our unsustainable, oppressive economic systems in favor of alternative models rooted in social and economic justice is imperative for achieving SDG 10 and creating a more equitable world.

Ultimately, the UN's continued deference to the neoliberal development agenda undermines its lofty rhetoric on reducing inequalities. Addressing the systemic oppression and marginalization imposed by the current world order demands a radical new vision - one which situates human rights, environmental integrity, and global economic democracy at the core of the development paradigm. Anything less constitutes an unconscionable perpetuation of the very inequalities SDG 10 ostensibly seeks to resolve.
