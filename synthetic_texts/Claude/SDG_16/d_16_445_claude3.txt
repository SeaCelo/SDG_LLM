As the Sustainable Sanitation Alliance, an expert-led coalition dedicated to promoting sustainable and equitable sanitation solutions globally, we present this analytical report on the current state of Sustainable Development Goal 16 (SDG 16): "Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels."

SDG 16 serves as a critical foundation for the entire 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, recognizing that without peace, justice, and effective governance, sustainable development cannot be achieved. The intrinsic linkages between sanitation, human rights, and the rule of law underscore the pivotal role of this goal in our collective efforts.

Despite notable progress in some regions, the global landscape remains concerning. Conflict, insecurity, and fragility continue to afflict numerous countries, exacerbating vulnerabilities and impeding development efforts. According to the latest data, an estimated 1.1 billion people live in countries affected by protracted crises, with children disproportionately impacted. The COVID-19 pandemic has further compounded these challenges, threatening to reverse hard-won gains and exacerbating existing inequalities.

Access to justice remains a significant barrier, with an estimated 1.5 billion people lacking legally recognized proof of identity, a fundamental prerequisite for accessing basic services, including sanitation. Furthermore, corruption continues to undermine institutional integrity and public trust, diverting resources from essential services and perpetuating cycles of poverty and marginalization.

In fragile and conflict-affected settings, the breakdown of governance structures and the erosion of the rule of law have dire implications for sanitation infrastructure, maintenance, and service delivery. Destruction or neglect of sanitation facilities, coupled with displacement and limited access to water resources, heightens the risk of disease outbreaks and environmental degradation, further compounding humanitarian crises.

Notably, the global sanitation crisis disproportionately affects marginalized communities, including women, children, and persons with disabilities. Inadequate access to safe and dignified sanitation facilities not only compromises health and well-being but also exacerbates vulnerabilities, perpetuating gender-based violence, school dropout rates, and social exclusion.

To address these multifaceted challenges, a comprehensive and coordinated approach is imperative. Sustainable sanitation solutions must be anchored in principles of inclusivity, participatory decision-making, and respect for human rights. Strengthening governance frameworks, enhancing institutional capacities, and fostering transparent and accountable systems are critical to ensuring equitable access to sanitation services.

Collaborative efforts among governments, civil society organizations, and the private sector are essential to mobilize resources, leverage innovative technologies, and promote context-specific, culturally sensitive solutions. Empowering local communities, particularly those most marginalized, is crucial to fostering ownership, sustainability, and resilience.

Investing in conflict prevention, peacebuilding efforts, and the promotion of the rule of law must be prioritized to create an enabling environment for sustainable development. Addressing root causes of fragility, such as inequalities, exclusion, and lack of access to essential services, is paramount to breaking the vicious cycle of conflict and underdevelopment.

Furthermore, robust monitoring and evaluation frameworks, coupled with disaggregated data collection, are imperative to track progress, identify gaps, and inform evidence-based policymaking. Integrating sanitation indicators into broader governance and human rights monitoring mechanisms can enhance accountability and catalyze transformative action.

As the Sustainable Sanitation Alliance, we remain committed to advocating for sustainable and equitable sanitation solutions that uphold human dignity, promote social cohesion, and contribute to the realization of SDG 16. Through collaborative partnerships, innovative approaches, and a steadfast commitment to human rights and the rule of law, we can pave the way for a more peaceful, just, and sustainable future for all.
