A World Without Violence or Corruption: Achieving SDG 16 is Key to a Prosperous Future

By the Forbes Editorial Board

When the United Nations launched the Sustainable Development Goals in 2015, perhaps no objective resonated more strongly in the business community than SDG 16 - the promotion of peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, access to justice for all, and building effective, accountable institutions at all levels. It's an ambitious and multifaceted goal, tackling issues like corruption, bribery, human trafficking, and protecting fundamental freedoms. But achieving SDG 16 may be the critical linchpin to catalyzing progress across all 17 SDGs.

Why does SDG 16 matter so much to the private sector? Simply put, commerce cannot thrive amid violence, human rights abuses, and captured institutions. Businesses need safe operating environments, reliable rule of law, and transparent governance to make investments, delivery goods and services, and conduct transactions. Rampant crime, civil unrest, and graft raise risks and costs, diverting resources that could otherwise flow into innovation, job creation, and economic growth.  

According to the UN, countries impacted by high levels of violence lose an estimated $13.6 trillion per year in economic activity and acquisitions - nearly 11% of global GDP. Criminal rackets like human trafficking generate around $150 billion annually for nefarious actors. Corruption enables insiders to siphon off an astounding 25% of global investment flows. Countries marred by profound injustice, lawlessness, and malfeasance struggle to attract foreign direct investment, top talent, and growth-oriented industries.

Conversely, nations with low corruption and high institutional integrity see substantial growth tailwinds. The World Economic Forum estimates that boosting integrity in emerging markets could unlock $2.6 trillion - equivalent to the entire GDP of France. The UN Global Compact has identified trillions more in potential economic value from advancing SDG 16 across three domains: governance, business integrity, and civic engagement.

From an commercial perspective, SDG 16 equates to de-risking the global operating environment and injecting potent economic stimuli through stronger institutions and rule of law. It promises a tectonic power shift - diverting resources away from criminals, authoritarians, and rent-seekers, toward productive enterprise and ethical actors in the private sector.

Of course, SDG 16 poses immense challenges, requiring robust anti-corruption measures, independent watchdogs, judicial reforms, and accountability mechanisms to dismantle the entrenched interests and power structures enabling violence and graft to persist. It will necessitate embedding principles like public integrity, transparency, and freedom of information into the core operating models of businesses and governments alike.

But the scope of the potential rewards is staggering. Imagine economic zones where property rights are secure, fair competition prevails, conflicts get resolved equitably, and everyone operates on a level playing field - the ideal climate for business formation and expansion. This is the promise of SDG 16: Prosperity through justice, integrity, and inclusion.

Increasingly, companies recognize their self-interest is aligned with advancing peace and rooting out corruption. A 2020 PwC survey found that upwards of 75% of global CEOs believe inaction on SDG 16 will negatively impact their business revenue and viability. Meanwhile, businesses that embrace anti-corruption and responsible growth models enhancing social stability and institutional legitimacy will be positioned as ethical leaders.

For the United Nations and its public and private sector partners committed to the 2030 Agenda, SDG 16 must be prioritized as a potential game-changer - a governance revolution poised to unlock trillions in sustainable growth, security, and prosperity. While the goal is fraught with political complexities and vested opposition, success could yield rewards of generational significance. Positioning ethical business as the prime beneficiary provides a powerful catalyst for making SDG 16 a reality.
