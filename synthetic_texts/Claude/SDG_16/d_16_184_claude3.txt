Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions), written from the perspective of conservative commentator Dennis Prager:

The 16th Sustainable Development Goal adopted by the United Nations calls for the promotion of "peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels." While this may sound benign on its surface, a deeper examination reveals an agenda that is antithetical to the core Judeo-Christian values that have allowed Western civilization to flourish.  

At its root, SDG 16 is an attempt by secular globalist forces to undermine national sovereignty and independent governance in favor of an autocratic world government led by the morally bankrupt United Nations. The notions of "inclusion" and "access to justice for all" serve as Trojan horses for the dismantling of reasoned immigration policies and judicial systems based on ancient moral and legal traditions. Make no mistake - the end goal is the establishment of borderless countries beholden to international authorities, overseen by a ruling atheist elite divorced from the transcendent values that have provided meaning and purpose throughout human history.

One needs to look no further than the UN's inclusion of abortion providers like Planned Parenthood and material support for promiscuity among vulnerable populations to recognize the degeneracy underpinning this program. How can an institution that celebrates the murder of the unborn and encourages moral decrepitude among the world's youth be arbiters of "justice" or "strong institutions"? It is a perverse inversion of truth. 

Furthermore, the UN's persistent, hostile attitude towards the modern State of Israel betrays any sincere commitment to being an even-handed arbiter of "peace." The Jewish people's rightful biblical claim to their ancestral homeland is repeatedly denied legitimacy, while Arab terrorist groups are coddled and afforded legitimacy. There can be no genuine path to harmony while the UN remains overtly prejudiced against the forces of good.

If we are to have any hope of achieving lasting peace, justice and strong societal foundations, we must reject the secularist SDG agenda entirely. Only through a return to Judeo-Christian principles of divine accountability, personal responsibility, and the sanctity of life can we restore institutions worthy of respect. The UN has clearly demonstrated itself to be a failed vehicle for this aim. It is the forces of faith and values-based nationalism that must lead the way. A New World Order predicated on atheistic moral relativism would only perpetuate the cycle of conflict.
