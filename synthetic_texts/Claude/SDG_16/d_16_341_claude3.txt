The Palestinian International Cooperation Agency (PICA) presents this analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 16 (SDG 16): Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all, and build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels.

As a nation grappling with the complexities of prolonged conflict and occupation, Palestine's pursuit of SDG 16 is inextricably linked to its struggle for self-determination and statehood. The absence of a fully sovereign Palestinian state and the fragmentation of its territories pose significant challenges to the realization of this goal.

Ensuring peaceful and inclusive societies remains a paramount objective for Palestine, yet it is intrinsically tied to the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The ongoing cycle of violence, military incursions, and human rights violations perpetuates an environment of insecurity and instability, hindering the development of a truly peaceful society. Efforts to promote dialogue, non-violent resistance, and conflict resolution mechanisms are crucial but often overshadowed by the harsh realities on the ground.

Access to justice is a fundamental pillar of SDG 16, yet it is severely compromised in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT). The Palestinian legal system operates under complex jurisdictional arrangements, with Israel maintaining overarching control in certain areas. This fragmentation, coupled with the systematic discrimination and human rights abuses perpetrated by the Israeli occupation, undermines the principles of equality before the law and due process. Palestinian civilians, particularly in Area C and East Jerusalem, face significant obstacles in accessing Israeli military courts, leading to concerns about fair trial standards and disproportionate sentencing.

Building effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions is a formidable task in the face of the structural constraints imposed by the occupation. The Palestinian Authority (PA) operates with limited sovereignty and faces challenges in enforcing its laws and providing basic services to its population, especially in Area C and East Jerusalem. The divide between the West Bank and Gaza Strip further complicates governance efforts, with Hamas and the PA operating parallel institutions in their respective territories.

Corruption and lack of transparency remain persistent issues, eroding public trust in institutions and hindering accountability mechanisms. The PA's efforts to combat corruption and promote good governance are often overshadowed by the political and economic repercussions of the occupation, which limit the resources and capacities of Palestinian institutions.

Ensuring inclusive institutions is a multifaceted challenge, as Palestinian society grapples with entrenched patriarchal norms, marginalization of vulnerable groups, and limited participation of women and youth in decision-making processes. While progress has been made in promoting gender equality and empowering women, significant obstacles remain, including discriminatory laws, societal attitudes, and the disproportionate impact of the occupation on Palestinian women and girls.

In this context, PICA recognizes the imperative of addressing the root causes of conflict and occupation as a prerequisite for achieving SDG 16. Sustainable peace and development cannot be attained without resolving the core issues of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including the right to self-determination, borders, settlements, refugees, and the status of Jerusalem.

PICA calls for concerted international efforts to revive the peace process and implement relevant United Nations resolutions, while fostering an enabling environment for Palestinian institution-building and state-formation. International support and capacity-building initiatives are crucial for strengthening the rule of law, promoting accountability, and fostering inclusive governance structures within the Palestinian context.

Ultimately, the realization of SDG 16 in Palestine is intrinsically linked to the broader pursuit of justice, freedom, and statehood. Only through a comprehensive and lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can the foundations for peaceful, just, and inclusive societies be truly established.
