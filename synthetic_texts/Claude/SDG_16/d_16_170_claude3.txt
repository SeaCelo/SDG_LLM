Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions), written from the perspective of economist Paul Krugman:

We live in an era of heightened global interdependence, where events on one side of the world can rapidly propagate shockwaves that destabilize economies and societies on the other side of the planet. Against this backdrop, achieving the lofty aspirations of Sustainable Development Goal 16 – promoting peaceful and inclusive societies, ensuring access to justice, and building effective, accountable institutions – has become an economic imperative as much as a moral one.

At its core, SDG 16 recognizes that human development cannot be nourished in an environment riven by conflict, corruption, and frayed social contracts. Violence, insecurity, and injustice erode the foundations for productive economic activity and stifle the human capital accumulation that underpins long-term growth. A mounting empirical literature affirms that countries blighted by fragility, violence, and weak rule of law experience severe drags on development progress.

Consider the pervasive efficiency losses stemming from institutional frailty. Where property rights are insecure, investment horizons shrink as economic actors become reluctant to make long-term commitments. Where corruption is endemic, allocative distortions arise as resources are diverted from their highest-value uses. Where judiciaries lack independence, the sanctity of contracts is imperiled – heightening risks and transactions costs. And where civic engagement is suppressed, the feedback loops that enhance policy accountability are severed.

These dynamics breed vicious cycles in which institutional infirmities beget economic stagnation, fueling alienation that further corrodes institutional legitimacy. We have seen this unfold with tragic consequences in fragile states like Yemen and South Sudan, where simmering grievances ultimately boiled over into open conflict – immiserating their populations and destabilizing entire regions.

Some may regard SDG 16 as an agenda focused primarily on low-income and conflict-affected states. But even the world's most advanced economies are not immune to the risks of fraying social fabrics and institutional decay. The United States, for instance, has experienced an erosion of judicial independence, a hollowing out of crucial governance capabilities, and a precarious unraveling of democratic norms that enabled the January 6th insurrection – shaking national and global confidence in its institutional resilience. Other OECD countries have experienced analogous strains amid spiking inequality, populist backlashes, and institutional drift.

Ultimately, robust and impartial institutions provide a critical buffer – at all stages of development – against shocks and centrifugal forces that could otherwise trigger vicious spirals of instability. They offer a resilient base for managing existential threats ranging from climate change to pandemics to cyber insecurity. Advancing SDG 16 is thus a generational undertaking to shore up the foundations for sustainable, inclusive development worldwide.

This agenda necessitates far-reaching reforms and overcoming profound collective action challenges. Key priorities include: fortifying the rule of law and enabling environments for civic participation; enhancing transparency and accountability in public resource management; bolstering mechanisms to defuse tensions and resolve disputes non-violently; building capable public institutions that can equitably deliver services and manage centrifugal pressures. 

Critically, solutions cannot simply be imported or imposed from the outside. Resilient institutions must be cultivated domestically – embedded in societal context and reinforced by robust state-society relations. As Rwanda's experience reminds us, transformative progress is possible even after immense trauma when accountable leadership purposefully rebuilds the institutional bedrock.

These are not siloed challenges but part of an integrated ecosystem; advances across the SDG 16 targets must go hand-in-hand to be catalytic and self-sustaining. And success hinges on nurturing inclusive, institutionalized arenas where states and societal groups can collaboratively forge durable, nationally-owned solutions.  

This generational endeavor demands ambitious financing that regards investments in peaceful societies and legitimate governance not as discretionary expenditures, but as vital productivity-enhancing infrastructure. Given the staggering costs societies bear from violence, instability, and institutional erosion, such investments can yield high social returns by unlocking larger economic dividends and stability.

As we navigate an era of deepening complexity marked by protracted asymmetric conflicts, rapidly evolving technologies, intensifying climate impacts, and other systemic risks – SDG 16's agenda of channeling constructive institution-building has become an existential economic priority. Strong, nationally-rooted institutions provide the resilient scaffolding not only for prosperity, but for societies' very survival. This monumental challenge demands sustained ambition backed by political will and innovative global partnerships. The alternative is a bleak future of dystopian instability and squandered human potential.
