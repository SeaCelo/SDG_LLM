Here is a draft academic article about SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions), written from the perspective of economist Lawrence J. Christiano:

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development laid out an ambitious set of 17 global goals aimed at creating a more prosperous, equitable and environmentally secure world. Among these Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), SDG 16 stands out as being particularly critical for undergirding progress across the entire agenda. Formally titled "Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions," this multifaceted objective is fundamentally about good governance - establishing the rule of law, ensuring equal access to justice, combating corruption and bribery, developing accountable and transparent institutions, and safeguarding fundamental rights and freedoms.  

From an economic perspective, the importance of SDG 16 cannot be overstated. There is a vast body of empirical evidence demonstrating that weak governance is inimical to economic development and growth. Countries beset by violence, rights abuses, endemic corruption and lack of judicial recourse for commercial disputes invariably suffer severe constraints on investment, productivity and human capital accumulation. In essence, SDG 16 establishes the institutional foundations required for macroeconomic and financial stability.

The relationship between governance quality and economic performance can be analyzed through the lens of my academic research on sources of business cycles. A core insight is that inefficient economic fluctuations are often propagated and amplified by nominal rigidities - firms' inability to fully adjust prices and wages in response to shocks. Corruption, policy uncertainty, lack of contract enforcement and macroeconomic volatility itself represent forms of implicit tax on firms that increase real rigidities and persistence of inefficient responses. Conversely, transparent rule-based policymaking in a society with robust checks and balances helps anchor inflation expectations and facilitates efficient relative price adjustments.

Peace and security, a central tenet of SDG 16, are also prerequisites for the cross-border flows of goods, services, capital and labor that lubricate the global economy. Armed conflicts, terrorism, refugee crises and other sources of regional instability inflict massive economic disruption both locally and internationally via trade linkages and capital flight. Even advanced economies are not immune - escalating military tensions and geopolitical brinkmanship can quickly rattle financial markets and undermine business and consumer confidence worldwide.

Another economic angle relates to sustainable natural resource management and environmental protection. Widespread corruption often enables rapacious over-exploitation of forests, fisheries, minerals and other resources in the absence of independent oversight and judicial deterrents. Moreover, weak governance frequently correlates with failure to enforce anti-pollution laws or uphold commitments under global climate accords. Illegal mining, wildlife trafficking and other black market activities can proliferate when monitoring is lax. Such "tragedy of the commons" outcomes erode a nation's stock of natural capital and exacerbate long-run growth constraints.

While some may view SDG 16 as primarily concerned with political ideals, I would argue that this goal is equally crucial for economic prosperity, financial stability and intergenerational equity in the utilization of environmental assets. Furthermore, its targets relating to non-discriminatory laws, participatory decision-making and public access to information can directly facilitate more inclusive, broad-based economic development over time.

Of course, governance reform and anti-corruption efforts represent monumental challenges in many countries, as entrenched elites often bitterly oppose threats to their power and illicit rent streams. Sustained progress will require multi-stakeholder cooperation encompassing governments, the private sector, civil society organizations and engaged citizens. Developed nations can help catalyze positive momentum by providing technical assistance, reducing global money laundering channels, demanding greater extractive industry transparency, and ensuring their own corporations uphold ethical business conduct abroad.

In summary, SDG 16 occupies a central and cross-cutting position within the 2030 Agenda by tackling root causes of economic underperformance, financial fragility, environmental degradation and sociopolitical instability. While difficult to implement, strengthening peace, justice and governance institutions could unlock tremendous untapped economic potential worldwide while helping safeguard planetary boundaries. It represents an investment in raising sustainable long-run growth trajectories for current and future generations alike. Harnessing macroeconomic and microeconomic analyses can yield powerful quantitative evidence to motivate concerted action on this pivotal sustainable development objective.
