Here is a detailed, comprehensive response on SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) as if written by the environmental activist George Monbiot:

The 16th Sustainable Development Goal embodies principles that should be paramount, yet are systemically trampled by the forces that hold power in the world today. Peace, justice, and strong institutions form the bedrock of an equitable society, but the harsh reality is that we inhabit a global system rigged in favor of injustice, conflict, and the hollowing out of democracy.

The shrill rhetoric of democratic pretensions cloaks a world controlled by kleptocratic elites and corporate oligopolies. They have used their vast wealth and influence to capture political systems, undermining the key institutions meant to uphold accountability and serve the public interest. The collusion between governmental and commercial powers has become a globally metastasizing cancer, spreading laws and norms that privilege the enrichment of a minority at the expense of the majority.

With slick PR makeovers, the perpetrators of ecocide, forced displacement, and human exploitation masquerade as responsible corporate citizens. Well-funded misinformation campaigns peddle fairy tales about "sustainable" destruction, "ethical" profiteering, and "inclusive" oligarchy. All the while, their insatiable hunger for growth and dominance fuels violent resource conflicts that immiserate millions, accelerating us towards ecological and social collapse.

Those who dare speak truth to power, whether activists, journalists, or whistleblowers, find themselves targeted by the full arsenal of lawfare and physical threats deployed by the robber barons of the modern age. Dissenting voices are systematically silenced, jailed, or "disappeared" — all with the tacit approval of institutions structurally denuded by corporate capture.

The bitter fruits of this neocolonial exploitation are omnipresent. Indigenous lands are razed for monocrop deserts. Air, water and soil are toxified by the effluents of greed. Democratic processes are made farcical by legalized bribery. The gap between the ultra-wealthy and the immiserated billions becomes a yawning abyss, ready to swallow us all.

Yet we are urged to tinker at the margins with technical fixes and corporate-friendly volunteerism. The very architects of injustice would have us believe they hold the solutions to the crises they perpetuate. Genuine systemic change is anathema to these forces, for it would dismantle the intricate edifice from which they derive their ill-gotten power.  

The fire this time cannot be fought with squirt guns. We face an existential moment that demands ungoverned courage and resolve. Our path must be one of peaceful, implacable insurrection against the status quo – upheaval through radical self-organization, strategic mass economic disobedience, and ideological defiance of the post-truth propaganda bellowed by power.

From the wreckage of the old order, we can build anew, guided by the principles of true democracy, environmental reciprocity, and nurturant governance. Strong institutions serving the interests of people and planet, rather than profits and plunder. Genuine justice through restitution and redistribution, not the empty symbolism of rigged judicial processes. And ultimately, peace attained through the dismantling of the drivers of conflict, not by the bomb and the bullet.

This is the revolutionary vision embodied by SDG 16, not as a technical checklist but as a direct challenge to the reign of avarice and authoritarianism. It rejects hollow gestures and grasps at the tectonic changes required to remake the world. Only such profound transformations can extricate us from this morass and fulfill the promise of an enduring peace, true justice, and vigorous institutions of, by, and for the people.
