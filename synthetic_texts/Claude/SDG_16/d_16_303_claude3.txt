Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) as if written by economist Raj Chetty:

Achieving the ambitious targets of Sustainable Development Goal 16 - promoting peaceful and inclusive societies, providing access to justice, and building effective, accountable institutions - is pivotal to catalyzing progress across the entire 2030 Agenda. However, our current understanding of how to tangibly realize these multifaceted aims remains inadequate. Leveraging insights from the emerging literature on equality of opportunity and drawing upon novel linked datasets, this article illuminates key barriers and facilitators to fulfilling SDG 16.

A foundational premise is that intergenerational mobility serves as a crucial pathway toward more peaceful, just societies underpinned by legitimate institutions. Where children's life prospects remain constrained by circumstances outside their control - such as race, gender, parental resources or birthplace - grievances inevitably fester. Perceived inequities and lack of faith in societal fairness can foster alienation, lack of civic engagement and susceptibility to radical ideologies or illicit economic activity. Conversely, societies exhibiting higher relative mobility engender greater social cohesion and commitment to established legal orders.

Extensive evidence reveals stark disparities in mobility across racial and socioeconomic lines within the United States. For instance, utilizing longitudinal data following 20 million individuals from childhood to their adult outcomes, we find that just 2.5% of children born to parents in the bottom quintile of the household income distribution manage to reach the top quintile as adults. In contrast, nearly 70% of children born to top-quintile parents remain institutionally advantaged across generations. These patterns are even more pronounced along racial lines, with Black Americans exhibiting virtually no intergenerational income mobility on average compared to their White peers in neighborhoods with similar poverty rates.

Critically, such mobility gaps arise not solely from differences in household resources, but also due to systemic inequities in environmental factors like school quality, neighborhood conditions and exposure to mentors and social networks. Tax and social policy reforms that level these playing fields hold immense potential to promote mobility and fulfill SDG 16's call for "equal access to justice for all" while countering root drivers of societal fragmentation, criminality and conflict.

For instance, insights from the Opportunity Atlas reveal that every year of childhood exposure to a higher-opportunity neighborhood elevates a child's household earnings and incarceration rates. Quasi-experimental analyses of housing mobility programs conclusively demonstrate that enabling children to grow up in more resourced communities dramatically improves their long-term outcomes across myriad dimensions, from educational attainment to neighborhood safety.  

Expanding affordable housing access and residential integration in opportunity-enriched areas could be complemented by reforms targeting inequities in school quality and incarceration policies that disproportionately handicap marginalized groups. Evidence on curtailing racial bias in criminal sentencing guidelines, expunging records for minor offenses, and reinvesting funds from mass incarceration toward community development would align powerfully with SDG 16's emphasis on "building effective, accountable institutions."

Even seemingly mundane factors like municipal policies around accessing minor municipal records like traffic violations can undermine economic mobility and degrade trust in legal institutions. My work demonstrates that automatically clearing fees and fines prevents millions from being forced into poverty, reducing financial scarcity and associated negative behaviors that undermine personal and civic wellbeing.

Core components of SDG 16 - protecting fundamental freedoms, curbing violence and exploitation, ensuring responsive and inclusive governance - remain tightly coupled to the intractable challenge of enhancing equality of opportunity worldwide. Substantial government revenues and foreign aid flows could be strategically channeled toward evidence-based interventions that dismantle systemic barriers to economic mobility. Doing so would catalyze mutually reinforcing progress toward more peaceful,inclusive communities and effective, representative institutions.

Longitudinal data infrastructures merging administrative datasets hold powerful potential to identify causal pathways and rigorously evaluate policy innovations aimed at fulfilling SDG 16. Strengthening these capabilities globally, expanding research-policy partnerships, and promoting interdisciplinary collaboration on topics spanning economics, criminology and social psychology will be essential to accelerate momentum.  Successfully fostering environments where all children can access pathways toward economic security and self-actualization is both a moral imperative and instrumental catalyst for realizing just, peaceful societies envisioned by this pivotal sustainable development objective.
