The pursuit of Sustainable Development Goal 16 – Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions – has been a pivotal endeavor for the Development Bank of Latin America and the Caribbean (CAF). In our region, the intricate interplay between governance, security, and socio-economic development has been a longstanding challenge, one that demands multifaceted interventions and unwavering commitment.

Addressing the pervasive issue of corruption has been a focal point for CAF's initiatives. Corruption not only undermines public trust and erodes the foundations of democratic institutions but also acts as a significant barrier to equitable development and resource allocation. Through targeted capacity-building programs and robust anti-corruption frameworks, we have sought to strengthen transparency, accountability, and integrity mechanisms across various sectors and levels of governance.

However, our efforts extend far beyond the mere implementation of policies and regulations. We recognize that sustainable peace and justice hinge on fostering inclusive and participatory decision-making processes. By actively engaging civil society organizations, marginalized communities, and indigenous populations, we strive to amplify their voices and ensure their perspectives are integrated into the policymaking discourse.

Furthermore, CAF has placed particular emphasis on enhancing access to justice, a cornerstone of resilient institutions. Through investments in judicial infrastructure, legal aid initiatives, and digital platforms for case management, we aim to bridge the gap between citizens and the justice system, empowering individuals to seek redress and uphold their fundamental rights.

Notably, our interventions are not confined to the realm of governance alone. We acknowledge the multidimensional nature of peace and stability, recognizing the inextricable links between security, socio-economic development, and environmental sustainability. Consequently, our endeavors encompass a holistic approach that addresses the root causes of conflicts, such as poverty, inequality, and natural resource scarcity.

One illustrative example is our collaboration with the governments of Colombia and Ecuador, where we have supported initiatives aimed at promoting economic opportunities and social cohesion in border regions affected by armed conflicts and illicit activities. By fostering sustainable livelihoods, enhancing access to basic services, and strengthening community resilience, we aim to create an enabling environment for durable peace and stability.

Moreover, CAF has been at the forefront of promoting regional integration and cooperation, recognizing that transnational challenges require collective action and shared responsibility. Through platforms for dialogue, knowledge exchange, and capacity-building, we facilitate collaboration among member countries, fostering a sense of unity and shared purpose in addressing common threats and upholding regional security.

As we look to the future, CAF remains committed to driving transformative change and fostering resilient, just, and inclusive societies across Latin America and the Caribbean. We acknowledge that progress towards SDG 16 is a long-term endeavor, one that requires sustained efforts, adaptability, and a continuous process of learning and innovation.
