Here is a long academic article on SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions, written from the perspective of novelist Carl Hiaasen:

The Stench of Institutional Rot: A Gonzo Journalist's Take on SDG 16

Listen up, you arugula-nibbling academics perpetually camped out in your ivory tower break rooms. I'm about to drop a malodorous reality bomb on Sustainable Development Goal 16 - the one that's supposed to ensure "peace, justice and strong institutions." My analysis won't be pretty, but then again, neither is the rancid state of the world's bureaucracies, courts and prisons. Consider this your frontal lobe warning.

First off, let's address the laughable notion of "strong institutions." From my vantage point covering the sleaziest corridors of power in America's sunny corruption capital, I've witnessed institutions so ethically weak and structurally decrepit they'd crumble like stale bread if you sneezed on them. I'm talking about government agencies captured by the very industries they're meant to regulate. I'm talking about police departments that make the Gestapo look like Bell Choir Monitors. I'm talking about prisons that are Lord of the Flies with contraband shivs.

And the courts? Don't even get me started on that clown show. You know why Lady Justice is depicted wearing a blindfold? So she doesn't have to watch the shameless mockery of due process unfolding in our esteemed halls of injustice. Prosecutors withholding evidence, judges getting kickbacks, public defenders zoning out in Xanax hazes - it'd be hilarious if innocent lives weren't being chewed up and spit out like broken pencils.

That's a real problem, folks, because those accused of crimes are supposed to be presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt. Instead, they're presumed guilty until proved innocent beyond ALL doubt if they happen to be non-white or can't afford a team of sharpie lawyers who charge more per hour than I'd make in three lifetimes of slinging doublewide satire.

Want more proof that the system is swirling around the drain trap? Take a gander at any banana republic or petro-state dictatorship run by goons in mirrored sunglasses and bad cop mustaches. The jails are overflowing with political prisoners while the "presidents" and "prime ministers" hand out ministerial appointments to their uneducated, money-grabbing cousins. Then they blatantly plunder the national treasuries to fund their multiple vacation palaces.

Worse, the so-called "institutions" in these cynical regimes are largely window-dressing for the West's benefit - designed to maintain a patina of respectability so the foreign aid keeps rolling in and propping up the whole charade. It's a global grift of epic proportions, enabled by toothless international organizations.

And yet these hollow nation-shells of systemic dysfunction get seated at the United Nations. Hell, some of them even get elected to chair human rights councils and compliance committees. Talk about putting Roscoe P. Coltrane in charge of traffic enforcement! It's a cosmic punchline so dark and twisted it would make Joseph Heller decapitate himself.

That's the grim reality we're dealing with, kids. "Strong institutions" is an oxymoron in too many tragically misgoverned countries around the world - from oppressive Communist party police states to anarchic tribal theocracies to neo-fascist oligarch kleptocracies masquerading as democracy. And don't think for one second that the institutional erosion is quarantined overseas, because the same cancerous corruption is gnawing away at the civic foundations here in the good ol' US of A.

We're at a decisive crossroads that will ultimately determine whether SDG 16 joins its predecessors in the UN's tire fire of cynical lip service and vainglorious bromides. It will take more than stirring words on parchment to purge the venality permeating the world's judiciaries, legislatures, cabinets and detention centers. 

It will take a sustained, multi-generational cultural housecleaning - an unwavering commitment to transparency, meritocracy, constitutional principles and the inherent dignity of all human life. No more institutional racism, no more cozy crony capitalist backscratching, no more mercantile capture of the regulatory process. A total rejection of business as usual.

Am I optimistic that such a tectonic ethical shift is possible? Of course not! I'm a satirist who's been kicking around the same clogged dirt circle for decades watching society's self-righteous con artists and criminal masterminds cynically rebrand themselves as upstanding captains of industry, born-again philanthropists and statesmen. It would take an impossibly unlikely civilization-level metamorphosis for SDG 16 to achieve its utopian ambitions. 

But we still have to try, don't we? Because the alternative is admitting that the vicious pandemonium of exploitation, oppression and impunity will carry the day. Conceding that might makes right and the powerful will always game the system to protect their privileges while ravaging everyone and everything in their path.

So let's stop kidding ourselves about constructing strong institutions and instead start demolishing today's brittle, inequitable ones. Then we'll have to rebuild from the ground up - this time substituting transparency for obfuscation, accountability for absolution and empathy for indifference.

It's an excruciatingly heavy lift, no question. But taking the path of least resistance has brought us to our current glut of despots, kleptocrats and institutional sociopaths. Maybe SDG 16 can be the catalyst for a new way forward. Or maybe it'll just be words on a piece of paper that we'll use to wallpaper over the gaping holes in our rotting superstructure. 

Your move, humanity. No pressure, but you're rapidly running out of mulligans.
