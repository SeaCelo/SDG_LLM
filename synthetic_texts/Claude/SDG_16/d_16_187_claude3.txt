Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions), written from the perspective of Eugene Robinson:

Ensuring Lasting Peace Through Justice and Strong Institutions: A Moral Imperative

By Eugene Robinson

The world today faces a paradox. Despite remarkable progress in reducing global poverty and raising living standards for millions, far too many people remain trapped in cycles of violence, insecurity, and injustice that undermine human dignity and human rights. The adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals by the United Nations, with SDG 16 specifically calling for promoting peaceful and inclusive societies founded on the rule of law, is a bold acknowledgment that development can never be fully realized in the absence of peace and good governance.

At its core, SDG 16 recognizes that freedom from fear, freedom from want, and freedom to live in dignity are indivisible and foundational to human progress. We cannot feed the hungry if the storehouse is looted by corrupt officials. We cannot educate a generation if teachers and students are killed in wars between armed militias. We cannot build democracy if authoritarian regimes routinely jail dissenters and deny their citizens the right to speak freely.  

Sustainable development depends on capable institutions that can impartially administer the law, deliver essential public services, and earn the trust of the people they are meant to serve and protect. When the social contract shatters, when the institutions of governance cease functioning, society descends into chaos. Look no further than nations being torn apart by sectarian strife, criminal violence, and civil war to see the awful human toll caused by weak governance and absent the rule of law.

Sadly, the injustices and indignities enabled by fragile states and failing institutions are often disproportionately borne by the world's most vulnerable and marginalized - women, minorities, indigenous peoples, refugees. Those with meager means and little political voice too frequently suffer exploitation, discrimination, and human rights violations without any legal recourse. The desperately poor are easy prey for human traffickers, unscrupulous employers, and corrupt officials who extort bribes for basic services.

That is why striving for the worthy goals encapsulated in SDG 16 strikes me as not just desirable but morally urgent. Consider its targets: reducing all forms of violence, ending human trafficking and torture, promoting the rule of law at all levels, sharply curtailing corruption and bribery, developing accountable and transparent institutions, and ensuring public participation and representative decision-making. In essence, SDG 16 demands that we replace injustice with justice, recrimination with reconciliation, exclusion with empowerment.

Achieving such an ambitious agenda will be enormously difficult. Rebuilding trust, reforming failed institutions, restoring societal cohesion - these are generational challenges that require sustained effort and commitment. Peacebuilding is painstaking and the road is long, but the alternatives of perpetual violence, oppression, and instability are morally unacceptable and unsustainable. We have a responsibility to our children and grandchildren to bequeath them societies governed humanely, ethically, and legally.

Some may dismiss SDG 16 as overly idealistic, but I believe its vision represents our moral imperative in the 21st century. From America's inner cities to the most remote regions of failed states, we must work to end cultures of impunity that enable violence, exploitation and dehumanization. We must invest in accountable institutions staffed by professionalized civil services that deliver for all citizens. We must uphold human rights and the rule of law not just as legal constructs but as bulwarks protecting human dignity.  

Our fates as a human family are intertwined. The insecurity and injustice that reign in one part of the world ultimately endanger prosperity and freedom elsewhere as afflictions like terrorism, trafficking, and lawless mass migration spread across porous borders. Forging an enduring peace thus requires redressing inequities, bridging divides, replacing discord with justice - and grounding it all in capable, inclusive governance that uplifts the entire "nation" of humanity. It is an awesome challenge, but one we economists simply must meet.
