Peace, justice and strong institutions – the 16th Sustainable Development Goal – might seem at first glance like a grab bag of lofty, pious aspirations. But it's more than that. SDG 16 is the keystone that allows the entire 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to cohere and function. Without meaningful progress on this goal, the others will remain perpetually out of reach.

Consider the cold logic of violence, exploitation and lawlessness. How can we realistically expect countries riven by armed conflict, criminal governance and human rights abuses to make headway on poverty, education, health care or environmental protection? The chaos and oppression perpetuated by fragile states serves as a tourniquet, strangling all hopes of development.

This isn't mere liberal hand-wringing. There's a hardheaded economic case as well. The planetary cost of violence was estimated at $14.76 trillion in 2022 alone, according to the Institute for Economics and Peace. That's 10.9% of global GDP down the drain thanks to conflict's gruesome tolls and spillover effects. Grim math indeed.

SDG 16 tackles this existential knot through an admirably comprehensive framework. Reducing violence of all forms, from armed conflict to domestic abuse, is front and center. But it goes further, calling for the rule of law, access to justice, accountable institutions, inclusive decision-making and public access to information. It recognizes that injustice, corruption and opacity are the shadowy enablers of violence and underdevelopment.

Some concrete wins have been notched: 116 countries now have national human rights institutions. But the overall picture is still grim. The world remains stuck in a morass of authoritarianism, with 83% of the global population living in countries becoming more closed and repressive. Attacks on human rights defenders are rising. And after a steady post-Cold War decline, armed conflicts have rebounded since the mid-2010s, taking a brutal human toll.

Resolving these crises won't be easy. But we have examples of what meaningful progress looks like. Look at how violence plummeted in Latin America as democratization and judicial reforms took hold through the 1990s and 2000s. Or the post-apartheid transformation of South Africa into (however imperfect) a rights-respecting democracy. 

There are no guarantees, of course. As last year's coup in Burkina Faso showed, even established democracies can slide backwards. Authoritarian capitalist powers like China have their own development models to peddle.

But the essential logic remains: Sustainable development depends on replacing the fetters of violence, corruption and injustice with the liberating force of the rule of law. Peace, accountability and empowerment aren't lofty add-ons. They're the bedrock civilized governance thats allows real progress to be built and reinforced. That's the under-appreciated wisdom of SDG 16 that we ignore at our peril.
