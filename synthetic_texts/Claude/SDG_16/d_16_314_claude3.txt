The Chilean Agency for International Cooperation presents a comprehensive analysis of the current state of Sustainable Development Goal 16 (SDG 16), focused on promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, providing access to justice for all, and building effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels.

Global Context
The global outlook for SDG 16 is concerning. Recent data shows an 8% increase in armed conflicts between 2018 and 2019, leading to a significant rise in the number of internally displaced persons and refugees. These populations often face severe human rights violations and lack access to effective justice mechanisms.

Corruption remains a persistent challenge, undermining trust in public institutions and depriving millions of access to basic services. According to Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index, more than two-thirds of countries scored below 50 on a scale of 0 to 100, highlighting worrying levels of corruption.

Public safety is another critical issue. Homicide rates remain alarmingly high in several regions, with Latin America and the Caribbean topping the list as the most violent regions globally. This violence has a devastating impact on economic, social, and human development, perpetuating cycles of poverty and marginalization.

Progress and Challenges
In Chile, there have been encouraging trends in reducing homicide rates, thanks to comprehensive violence prevention and control policies. Reforms in the judiciary and measures to strengthen transparency and accountability have also helped improve public trust in institutions.

However, significant challenges persist. Access to justice remains unequal, with vulnerable groups such as women, children, persons with disabilities, and Indigenous peoples facing disproportionate barriers to effective redress mechanisms. The protection of human rights defenders and journalists remains a critical concern, as they often face threats and attacks for their advocacy and transparency efforts.

Key Actions for Progress
Addressing these challenges requires a multidimensional approach involving governments, civil society, the private sector, and international organizations. Key measures include:

Strengthening Conflict Prevention and Resolution Mechanisms: Promote inclusive dialogue, mediation, and peacebuilding at the community level.
Implementing Structural Reforms to Combat Corruption: Enhance transparency, accountability, and institutional integrity.
Investing in Justice Systems: Ensure equitable access to justice and the protection of human rights.
Fostering Citizen Participation: Include vulnerable groups in decision-making processes to build trust in institutions and social cohesion.
Developing Comprehensive Violence Prevention Strategies: Address underlying causes such as poverty, inequality, and social exclusion.
Conclusion
Achieving SDG 16 is fundamental to ensuring sustainable development and building more peaceful, just, and inclusive societies. It will require concerted and sustained efforts from all stakeholders, along with an unwavering commitment to transparency, accountability, and respect for human rights. The Chilean Agency for International Cooperation remains steadfast in its dedication to contributing to this critical goal through its international cooperation initiatives and programs.
