As the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, I am deeply committed to addressing the pressing challenges related to Sustainable Development Goal 16 (SDG 16), which aims to "promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all, and build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels."

The pursuit of SDG 16 is inextricably linked to the plight of refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) around the world. Conflict, violence, and human rights violations are among the primary drivers of forced displacement, with millions of people fleeing their homes each year in search of safety and protection. Conversely, the lack of access to justice, weak rule of law, and ineffective governance structures can exacerbate existing conflicts and create conditions that breed further instability and displacement.

One of the most pressing challenges we face is the widespread impunity for crimes committed against refugees and IDPs, including gender-based violence, human trafficking, and other grave human rights violations. Too often, perpetrators go unpunished, and victims are denied access to justice, perpetuating a cycle of violence and trauma. Addressing this issue requires a multifaceted approach that strengthens legal systems, enhances capacity-building for law enforcement and judicial institutions, and empowers refugee communities to seek redress and participate in decision-making processes.

Furthermore, the lack of effective and inclusive governance structures in many regions plagued by conflict and displacement poses significant obstacles to achieving SDG 16. Refugees and IDPs are often excluded from political processes, deprived of their rights, and left vulnerable to exploitation and marginalization. Building inclusive and accountable institutions that respect the rights of all individuals, including refugees and IDPs, is crucial for fostering sustainable peace and development.

To illustrate the challenges at hand, let us consider the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where protracted conflicts and widespread violence have displaced millions of people both within the country and across borders. Despite ongoing efforts by the international community, access to justice remains elusive for many victims, and impunity for human rights violations persists. The weakness of state institutions and the lack of accountability mechanisms have contributed to a climate of insecurity and instability, hindering efforts to achieve sustainable development and durable solutions for displaced populations.

Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive and coordinated approach that involves a range of stakeholders, including national governments, civil society organizations, and the international community. Strengthening the rule of law, promoting transparency and accountability, and fostering inclusive and participatory governance structures are essential steps towards achieving SDG 16 and ensuring that the rights and dignity of refugees and IDPs are upheld.

Additionally, we must recognize the intrinsic link between SDG 16 and other Sustainable Development Goals, such as SDG 5 (Gender Equality), SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals). Promoting gender equality and empowering women and girls, who are disproportionately affected by displacement and violence, is crucial for building inclusive and peaceful societies. Addressing inequalities and ensuring equal access to justice and political participation for marginalized groups, including refugees and IDPs, is essential for achieving sustainable development.

Ultimately, the successful implementation of SDG 16 hinges on robust partnerships and collaboration among various stakeholders, including national governments, international organizations, civil society, and refugee communities themselves. By leveraging our collective expertise, resources, and commitment, we can create an enabling environment for peaceful and inclusive societies, where the rights and dignity of all individuals, including refugees and IDPs, are respected and upheld.
