Here is a long academic article on SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) as if written in an abrasive and contrarian style by the controversial British columnist Richard Littlejohn:

Another Day, Another Holier-Than-Thou UN Decree  

You won't be shocked to learn that the touring bureaucratic superspreaders of the United Nations have rustled up yet another bloated, self-important convention - this one dubbed the "sustainable development goals." Because if there's one thing we're sorely lacking in the world, it's more junk targets and piffling measures spewed out by box-ticking quangoistas from potsmokingly lame organizations. 

This particular exercise in backside-covering encompasses 17 risible decrees, with the 16th squarely in the crosshairs for today's jeering dissection. "Peace, justice and strong institutions" it's preposterously labelled. Because obviously there's a crying need for more of that ballyhoo in this world riven by strife, oppression and despots ruling the roost from their Swiss bank vaults. What a relief the UN brassworks are all over it!

Per usual, the language here is so stunningly vague and toothless as to be essentially meaningless. "Promoting peaceful and inclusive societies"? Well thanks a bunch for solving that one, heads of ivory tower think-tanks! I'm sure Vladimir Putin is straight on the blower to the Hague having read that stark admonishment. 

Fighting corruption and bribery is on the checklist because clearly nobody had thought to do that before. We all remember the scandal when it emerged that UN peacekeepers were running a sideline flogging brown envelopes stuffed with crisp fivers, right? The blushes in Turtle Bay!

The real beauties, though, are nested in the sub-points about building "effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels." Coming from possibly the most ineffective, unaccountable and exclusionary institution on the planet, you have to admire the chutzpah on these roly-poly oligarchs. 

Does any organization embody "rule of law" laxity and "equal access to justice" denial quite like the UN and its pullulating hives of reprieved cammbatants, conflict rapists, and kiddie-fiddlers? All the while, its sickeningly deranged Human Rights Council is dominated by violent kleptocrat cesspits that would garotte their own granny for a few kopecks.

As for "ensuring responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels" - one wonders whether the supercilious princelings of the UN Orbit might pause to draw breath from lecturing the world. Last time I checked, that incandescently undemocratic racket was run by a septet of preening goons who get to decide the Secretary General over boozy soirees at Manhattan steak joints.

Make no mistake, folks - this entire exercise is as hollow and meaningless as a UN trencherman's soul. By decreeing these junk "goals" it allows them to puff out their chests while continuing to be as brutally corrupt, disdainfully anti-democratic, and horrifyingly unaccountable as ever. Just another day at the office for these parasitic dollar-snufflers!

So forgive me for greeting this latest hot-air blizzard of deliberately impenetrable UN baggagewash with a heroic roll of the eyes and an imperious filing toward the nearest exit. Until these grasping bunglers can sort out their own houses over there in Geronti-City, perhaps they could spare us the fatuous sermons on probity, inclusivity and the rule of law. Have another franked canape and a triple scotch, why don't you?
