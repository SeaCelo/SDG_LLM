Here is a detailed academic article about the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 16 on peace, justice and strong institutions, written from the perspective of conservative commentator Mark Steyn:

The Sustainable Dismantling of the Nation State: How the UN's 'Peace' Agenda Codifies a Borderless World 

By the esteemed Mark Steyn

The United Nations was founded in the ashes of World War II with lofty goals of maintaining international peace and security. Or so they claim. Beneath the veneer of its trite slogans lies a more insidious agenda - the de facto dissolution of the sovereign nation state.

Consider the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 16, which calls for the promotion of "peaceful and inclusive societies" and "effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels." On the surface, it sounds benign enough. Peace, justice, good governance - what's not to like? But examine the subversive language more closely. 

"Inclusive" societies and institutions necessarily require open borders and the free movement of peoples. After all, it would be exclusionary for sovereign nations to restrict immigration only to citizens and legal residents. Under the SDG 16 framework, every human being on the planet is entitled to equal access and membership.

But a world of open borders, untrammeled migration, and de facto global citizenship is the antithesis of the nation state. How can any cohesive society maintain a unique national identity, culture, and values if it is perpetually reshaped by endless waves of newcomers bearing different identities, cultures, and values? The very essence of a nation - its people's shared traditions, language, ethnicity and beliefs shaped over centuries - is increasingly denigrated as "xenophobic."

Worse, the UN's justice agenda under SDG 16 amounts to a borderless world effectively governed by unaccountable international laws and tribunals. The goal speaks of promoting "rule of law at the national and international levels," a verbose euphemism for the subjugation of domestic legal codes to a tyrannical global jurisdiction.

Such overarching international laws would render meaningless whatever rights and liberties your nation still retains. The U.S. Constitution and its government of, by and for the American people? Nullified by statutes from peripatetic UN kleptocrats who view national sovereignty as an obstruction.

Under this frightening schema, the American justice system must submit to the diktats of the UN Human Rights Committee, whose members include stellar human rights advocates like the Democratic Republic of Congo, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Your God-given freedoms, now subject to the scorn of aliens who have never experienced, nor desire, the liberties that we were bequeathed.

Our Judeo-Christian moral foundations? Too exclusive for the UN's ecumenical dogma. Our commitment to economic liberty and property rights? They'll be "redistributed" to favored identity groups, along with your hard-earned wealth.  

What about "effective, accountable institutions"? That's UN-speak for bureaucratic bloat and institutional decay. Just look at their dysfunctional subsidiary, the European Union, with its perpetual democratic deficits, moribund economics, and social ructions from unplanned migration.

So the UN's much-ballyhooed Goal 16 is really about dismantling the intrinsic rights and liberties of the world's free peoples under the auspices of delivering some hazily-defined greater good. It's Remapping Of The World into one featureless, deracinated morass.

In its place, we are offered an ironic facsimile of peace - the coerced stasis of obedient citizens rendered inert to their disposession. They call it "sustainable development." I call it paved with malign intentions, no matter how florid their saccharine rhetoric.

If we wish to avoid being engulfed by their utopian fantasy, we must forcefully reclaim our birthright of national sovereignty - the right of a people to govern themselves through democratic consent and the rule of law within secure borders. A borderless world is a rootless existence without meaning.

So push back against the SDG deceivers. Because in their perverse New World Order, that most elemental of human aspirations - the freedom to pursue life, liberty and happiness - will only be sustainable for a rootless, cosmopolitan elite luxuriating in their unaccountability. For the rest of us...not so much.
