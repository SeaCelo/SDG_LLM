Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions), written from the perspective of Victor Davis Hanson:

The establishment of peaceful and inclusive societies based on justice, accountability and effective institutions at all levels is foundational to any flourishing civilization. The post-colonial world of the 20th century witnessed the systematic dismantling of colonial rule, rightly so in most cases as alien dominance was shed from indigenous populations yearning to breathe free. However, the abrupt transition to self-rule has not been seamless, often leaving a perilous vacuum of governance and state fragility in its wake.

In the present age, we find too many nations of the world still mired in cycles of violence, corruption, lawlessness and oppression - the very opposite of SDG 16's noble mandate. The forces of globalized criminality, terrorist extremism, unchecked migration, sectarian conflict and illiberalism have thrown great strains upon public order and human rights observances. We would do well to take guidance from the classical wisdom of the ancients in rebuilding sturdy foundations.

The ancient Greek concept of "isonomia" - equality under the law as the cornerstone principle of a free society - is particularly instructive. In the 5th century B.C. "golden age" of Athens, democratic reforms codified transparent laws and fostered independent institutions to fairly adjudicate disputes, however imperfectly these ideals were ultimately realized. The great historians Thucydides and Xenophon chronicled the indispensability of civic courage and stable government in maintaining security and justice amidst unending conflict. From Rome we inherit advanced notions of citizenship, jurisprudence and robust political institutions capable of effective administration over vast imperial dominions.  

In our present era, the United Nations has boldly undertaken SDG 16's challenging mandate. However, its record of enforcement in crisis zones has been uneven and undermined by the countervailing interventions of rogue state and non-state actors. How much more effective might UN peace-keeping deployments be with enhanced deterrent capability and reciprocal accountability from transgressor nations? Likewise, global anti-corruption monitoring remains inadequate and beholden to the self-interests of illiberal regimes enabling illicit outflows.

Perhaps the most vexing obstacle to SDG 16 is the crisis of public trust eroding the perceived legitimacy of institutions in developed nations - a crisis exacerbated by elite aloofness, uncontrolled immigration and polarization stemming from identitarian tribalism. If justice, accountability and the rule of law become mere polymorphic pawns of special interests and ideology, then universal equal application before the law inevitably breaks down.

Noble intentions and lofty rhetoric alone are insufficient for realizing SDG 16's promise. Contemporary statesmen, civil society and global institutions must rediscover the eternal verities of muscular leadership, inviolable sovereignty and civic unity that built the rule of law and social cohesion in prior civilizations. Nurturing legitimacy, deterrence and transparency within modernized frameworks is the daunting imperative for securing peace, justice and accountable governance in our age. As the ancient poet Archilochus wrote: "The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing." Let SDG 16 be our singular, preeminent focus for tackling violence, exploitation and lawlessness - one unwavering step at a time.
