Promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, providing access to justice for all, and building effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels – these are the ambitious objectives enshrined in SDG 16. As a macroeconomist and scholar of monetary economics, I find this goal particularly fascinating as it delves into the institutional foundations that underpin economic development and societal well-being.

A core tenet of my research has been the recognition that market economies are inherently afflicted by imperfections and frictions arising from issues such as imperfect information, incomplete contracts, and limited commitment. These frictions can severely constrain the ability of markets to function efficiently and equitably, leading to suboptimal outcomes from a social perspective. Institutions – the formal and informal "rules of the game" that govern economic interactions – play a pivotal role in mitigating these frictions and promoting more efficient and equitable allocation of resources.

Effective institutions that uphold the rule of law, protect property rights, and enforce contracts are essential for facilitating productive economic activity, fostering investment and innovation, and promoting broad-based economic growth. Conversely, institutional weaknesses characterized by corruption, lack of transparency, and unequal access to justice can breed economic inefficiencies, exacerbate inequality, and undermine social cohesion.

The 2007-2009 global financial crisis, which I studied extensively, provided a stark illustration of the profound economic and social consequences of institutional failures. The crisis exposed deep-seated flaws in the regulatory and supervisory frameworks governing financial markets, as well as a lack of accountability and transparency in the financial sector. The resulting economic dislocations and hardships disproportionately affected vulnerable segments of society, exacerbating inequality and eroding trust in institutions.

In the aftermath of the crisis, there has been a renewed focus on strengthening institutional frameworks to promote financial stability and inclusive growth. However, as the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated, institutional resilience is not confined to the financial sector alone. The pandemic has highlighted the critical importance of strong and effective institutions in areas such as public health, social safety nets, and governance structures for managing crises and ensuring accountability.

Achieving the objectives of SDG 16 requires a multifaceted approach that addresses institutional weaknesses at various levels – local, national, and global. At the national level, efforts must focus on strengthening the rule of law, combating corruption, and promoting transparency and accountability in governance structures. This may involve measures such as judicial reforms, anti-corruption initiatives, and mechanisms for protecting whistleblowers and promoting freedom of information.

Additionally, inclusive and participatory decision-making processes are crucial for ensuring that institutions are responsive to the needs and aspirations of all segments of society, particularly marginalized groups. Mechanisms for stakeholder engagement, community participation, and civil society involvement can help foster a sense of ownership and legitimacy in institutional frameworks.

At the global level, there is a need for enhanced international cooperation and coordination to address cross-border challenges such as organized crime, illicit financial flows, and human trafficking. Strengthening global governance structures, promoting adherence to international norms and standards, and facilitating the sharing of best practices can play a pivotal role in bolstering institutional capacities across countries.

Ultimately, the success of SDG 16 hinges on a recognition that institutions are not mere abstract constructs but rather the foundational pillars that shape the incentives, behavior, and outcomes of economic and social interactions. By fostering strong, accountable, and inclusive institutions, we can create an enabling environment that promotes sustainable development, ensures access to justice, and upholds the principles of peace and shared prosperity.
