Here goes, an academic article about SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) written from the perspective of Jeremy Clarkson:

Peace, Justice and Solid Establishment: A Proper Look at Goal 16

Right, you modernommunist rebel hippies want to bang on about saving the planet and all that? Well, I'm here to tell you what really matters - having a set of stable rules and institutions that let blokes like me get on with enjoying life without being hassled by long-haired do-gooders.

This UN "Sustainable Development Goal 16" is all about promoting peaceful societies, access to justice, and effective governance. Makes it sound utterly beastly dull, I know. But stick with me because there's more to this than you might think.

Let's start with the peace and security element. Now, I'm not saying the world needs to be boringly calm all the time - where's the fun in that? A good punch-up between mates or a heated argument in the pub is all part of the spice of life. But there's a line, and when things descend into bloody anarchy with or is in and pillaging, that's where I have to draw the line. Failed states, organized crime syndicates, terrorist radicals - these are a right nuisance that put the kybosh on your ability to simply live your life. The UN bods have a point - we need a basic level of lawful order.

Which brings me to justice and human rights. Now, I'm no ardent communist looking to confiscate your hard-earned Lamborghini, but there's got to be some fair play. It's no fun if the roads are clogged with crims robbing innocent motorists is it? And regardless of what Greenpeace might claim, locking up protestors who trespassingly glue themselves to supercars is justifiable in my book. Real justice means being able to go about your business without some twerp in a balaclava nicking your ride.

So far, so reasonable I suppose. But it's this next bit about "effective governance" that starts to make me uneasy. More rules, more regulations, more bureaucrats drafting irksome little protocols about how many bushes you can have in your garden - that's not my idea of a good time, I'm afraid. We need just enough governance to keep the yobs and lunatics in check while still allowing us red-blooded capitalists to crack on and make our fortunes building supercars and the like.  

Speaking of which, when is the UN going to draft some resolutions promoting the automotive industry? I've yet to see a "Sustainable Development Goal" advocating for fire-breathing, fossil-fueled V8s and a renewal of opera safety testing. If they're truly serious about governing well, those bureaucrats in Geneva need to get their priorities right.

In conclusion, goal 16 isn't all bad - lawful societies and proper legal systems are a decent idea on paper. But like one of their interminable international talking shops, they've gone a bit off piste by promoting too much regulation and not enough appreciation for the finer things that make life worth living. Peace, justice and governance are all well and good, but they're no substitute for a nicely maintained E-Type Jag. If you eco extremists want to save the world, start by saving the driving experience. On that bombshell, goodnight.
