Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions), written in the style of renowned author and journalist Gene Weingarten:

Of the 17 lofty and aspirational Sustainable Development Goals laid out by the United Nations, one stands apart as being particularly thorny, multifaceted and absolutely fundamental to the success of the entire 2030 Agenda. SDG 16 - Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions - is a doozy. It aims to "promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels." In other words, it wants to fix humankind.

This is no mere tertiary goal to be passively endorsed, like "don't litter" or "be nice to your grandmother." No, SDG 16 demands vigorous institutional reform and a reordering of societal priorities on a global scale. It calls for an assault on corruption, crime and human rights violations while strengthening the rule of law, increasing transparency and building public trust in governments. It's like being asked to subdue a growling rottweiler using only a frosted cupcake as an inducement.

The audacity of the goal is both breathtaking and, to cynics, laughable. After all, violence, exploitation and poor governance have been woven into the fabric of civilization since its dawning. As a humanoid species, we've managed to turn the hunting and subjugation of our own kind into an existential tradition rivaling the harvest festival. So forgive me for finding SDG 16's ambitions more than a tad quixotic.

And yet, we persist in this sanity-defying campaign to make the planet safer, more ethical and less of a powderkeg. Why? Perhaps it's mere self-preservation; an understanding that failing to address corruption, violence and frayed civil institutions will only breed greater instability. A char-broiled world with no rule of law doesn't sound like a savory prospect.

There's also an economic argument for SDG 16's initiatives. According to the UN, the global cost of armed conflict over the last two decades exceeds $14 trillion. Fraud and dishonest business practices cost at least 5% of global GDP annually. And the diversion of funds through corrupt channels makes the noble goal of poverty reduction incredibly arduous.

So despite the Sisyphean nature of the challenge, the UN has outlined a raft of metrics and interim targets for measuring progress under SDG 16 by 2030. These include reducing all forms of violence and associated death rates, ending human trafficking and sexual exploitation, promoting the rule of law and access to justice, combating organized crime, reducing illicit financial flows and arms trafficking, and increasing transparent institutions and public participation in decision-making.

The good news is there are already some modest bright spots illuminating the path. Battle deaths from conflict are down globally since peaking in the 1950s. Discriminatory laws and policies have been dismantled in many countries. And technologies like blockchain are enabling greater transparency in transactions and supply chains.

However, the overall picture remains rather bleak. Armed conflict still rages in regions cynically dubbed the "blood diamond latitudes." Human trafficking generates estimated annual profits of $150 billion for international mafias. And staggering corruption is still deeply entrenched in public and private sectors worldwide, facilitated by shadowy illicit financial flows.

Righting these manifold wrongs will require concerted action on many fronts - from strengthening judicial systems to greater civic engagement, from bolstering free press freedoms to confronting socioeconomic inequalities that breed discontent. It will necessitate a level of international cooperation and coordination arguably unprecedented in human affairs.  

Will we succeed in achieving SDG 16's sweeping aspirations by 2030 or some future date? Your guess is as good as mine. But I do know one thing - the attempt alone is a magnificent act of self-delusional hubris that makes me proud to be human. We may be bent, but we're also beautifully bent.
