Here is a detailed academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions), written from the perspective of renowned author and commentator Shobhaa De:

The Mirage of Peace in Our Fractured World

As I sip my morning cuppa on the bougainvillea-draped verandah of my colonial-era bungalow, the morning papers are awash with fresh horrors from conflict zones around the world. Shocking images of bombed out cities, weeping refugees, and shrouded bodies litter the pages like macabre modern art. How is it that in the 21st century, an era where human ingenuity has scaled dizzying heights of technological and scientific brilliance, we remain shackled by the basest of human flaws - greed, hatred, and the unquenchable thirst for power? 

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations are a noble, if naive, attempt to solve the world's most pressing problems through a series of targets and indicators. SDG 16 in particular - Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions - seems almost farcical in today's realpolitik of authoritarianism, escalating military tensions, and resurgent ethnic animosities worldwide.

Inclusive societies and access to justice for all? In lands where religious and ethnic minorities are systematically oppressed, dissent is brutally crushed, and egregious human rights abuses are the norm rather than the exception, such lofty ideals ring hollow. From the persecuted Uighurs of China's Xinjiang province to the Rohingya refugees haunting the squalid camps of Cox's Bazaar, the promise of justice remains a chimera.

Reduce corruption and bribery? One only has to witness the brazen VIP culture thriving in the swishing convoys of the power elite in the national capitals, or the opulent reserves and privations enjoyed by the ruling classes, to know that transparency and accountability remain distant dreams. The tentacles of the crooked corporate-bureaucrat-politician nexus are ubiquitous and unrelenting.

Strengthen participation in governance? Even in the world's loudly trumpeted democracies, the voices of the poor, the marginalized and the dispossessed remain muted and powerless against the forces of crony capitalism, religious nationalism, and vested interests peddling divisive and regressive agendas.     

Peace and security? With conflicts raging on multiple fronts - from Russia's revanchist ambitions in Ukraine to the intractable quagmires in Yemen, Syria and across the swaths of Africa's failed states - it seems the pestilence of war shall remain an ineradicable aspect of the human condition. Billions are spent annually on fueling the blood-soaked machinery of death and destruction, even as children go hungry and the planet burns.

On my writing desk lies a fading black and white photograph from my childhood - a vignette of an idyllic time when the world seemed full of promise and the path to peace through development an achievable dream. That photo captures a moment when humanity dared to dream of a more just, equitable and harmonious future. A naive fantasy, one might say in today's weltanchauung of curdled cynicism and race-to-the-bottom realpolitik.  

Yet, underneath the weariness and resignation, a flicker of hope still burns within me, much like the tea lights that bravely flicker amidst the evening shadows cast by the raucous bamboo thickets fringing my verandah. For the arc of the moral universe may be long, as the wise ones say, but it bends towards justice. And on that slender reed of faith rests humanity's best, perhaps only, chance at creating a truly inclusive, peaceful and sustainable world order - one where the letter and spirit of SDG 16 is made manifest.
