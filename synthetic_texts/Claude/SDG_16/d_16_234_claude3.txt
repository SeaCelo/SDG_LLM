The following is an article on Sustainable Development Goal 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) from the perspective of renowned economist Barry Eichengreen:

Achieving lasting peace, promoting inclusive societies grounded in justice, and building effective, accountable institutions are prerequisites for sustainable development. Yet, these remain elusive goals for far too many nations around the world. Conflict, insecurity, weak governance, and systemic corruption continue to plague societies and undermine economic and social progress.

The 2008 global financial crisis laid bare the consequences of institutional failures and regulatory lapses. The crisis originated in advanced economies with sophisticated legal systems and purportedly strong institutions. If long-established democracies could not inoculate themselves against such destabilizing events, what hope is there for nations still struggling to entrench the rule of law and cultivate resilient institutions?

In the wake of the crisis, I was struck by how rapidly social unrest and civic distrust metastasized, even in societies with deep traditions of democratic pluralism and government accountability. Populist demagogues rapidly gained traction by scapegoating migrants and ethnic minorities. From the British campaign for Brexit, to Trump's anti-immigrant populism, to the racist diatribes of European far-right agitators â€“ all were manifestations of eroding institutional legitimacy and civic cohesion.

Sustainable Development Goal 16 is a clarion call to renew our commitment to participatory governance, inclusive decision-making, access to justice, and building effective national and international institutions. Prioritizing peace, security, and respect for human rights is not just a moral imperative, but an economic one. By the World Bank's estimates, armed conflict costs the global economy upwards of $14.5 trillion per year in attendance economic losses.  

Endemic corruption is equally corrosive, diverting resources from productive investment, undermining the delivery of vital public services, and perpetuating inequities that ultimately fuel grievance and instability. Each year, businesses and individuals pay over $1 trillion in bribes globally. These illicit outflows deprive developing countries of indispensable capital for infrastructure, education, and healthcare.

For the international community to make lasting progress on the 2030 Agenda, we must treat Goal 16 as the binding constraint. Peaceful, just, and inclusive societies are the bedrock upon which all other development objectives are constructed. It is imperative that we mobilize collaborative strategies to reduce violence, enhance transparency, combat corruption, and cultivate robust institutions capable of delivering public goods and services equitably.

The World Bank, regional development banks, UN agencies and international donors have essential roles to play in assisting national reformers and civil society groups in governance reforms and anti-corruption initiatives. But equal emphasis must be placed on conflict prevention, citizen security programs, and strengthening the rule of law. From security sector reform to bolstering judicial independence, a holistic approach is needed.

In fragile and conflict-affected states, the international community must thoughtfully sequence governance interventions to align with local contexts and conflict dynamics. Simplistic formulas importing foreign institutional templates have repeatedly failed due to lack of national ownership and perceived legitimacy deficits.

There are no easy solutions, but enhanced international cooperation, reformed global governance, and renewed commitments to multilateralism are prerequisites. Pooling resources, knowledge, and capabilities through innovative multi-stakeholder partnerships will be vital for making substantive progress on SDG16. The threats of rising populism, democratic backsliding, authoritarianism, climate insecurity, and cross-border organized crime demand concerted global responses.

If the bold vision embedded in the SDGs is to be realized, we must lay sturdy institutional foundations. Our aspirations for eliminating poverty and safeguarding human welfare are contingent upon first establishing peaceful and inclusive societies underpinned by transparent, accountable, and effective governance. There are no shortcuts - strengthening institutions and the rule of law must be the international community's highest priority.
