Ensuring peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, providing access to justice for all, and building effective, accountable institutions at all levels are the ambitious aims enshrined in Sustainable Development Goal 16. As a development economist with expertise in program evaluation and causal inference, I believe rigorous empirical analysis is crucial for understanding the challenges in achieving SDG 16 and devising evidence-based policies to address them.

One of the key barriers to fostering peaceful societies is the prevalence of violence, conflict, and insecurity in many parts of the world. Estimating the causal impacts of conflict exposure on socioeconomic outcomes is an important line of research. Leveraging quasi-experimental variation and applying state-of-the-art econometric techniques, scholars have documented the detrimental effects of violence on human capital accumulation, employment, and subjective well-being. However, identifying the mechanisms through which conflict erodes development is crucial for policy design. Does exposure to violence directly impact preferences and decision-making, or does it operate through indirect channels such as the destruction of infrastructure and disruption of markets? Understanding these pathways can inform targeted interventions aimed at mitigating the consequences of conflict.

Access to justice is another critical dimension of SDG 16, yet significant disparities persist across and within countries. Conducting randomized control trials (RCTs) that evaluate interventions to improve access to legal services, enhance public awareness of rights, and strengthen institutional capacity can yield valuable insights. For instance, an RCT in Liberia found that providing information and cash to cover incidental fees increased the utilization of public services among marginalized groups. However, the external validity of such findings and the potential for scaling up successful pilots remain open questions that require careful examination.

Strengthening accountable and transparent institutions is a complex endeavor, as institutional quality is shaped by a multitude of factors, including political economy considerations, cultural norms, and historical legacies. Instrumental variable strategies that exploit plausibly exogenous sources of variation in institutional features can shed light on their causal impacts on development outcomes. For example, recent studies have leveraged colonial origins and historical epidemiological events as instruments to examine the effects of contemporary institutions on economic growth and public goods provision.

Moreover, understanding the determinants of institutional quality itself is a fruitful area of inquiry. Exploiting natural experiments, such as shifts in political leadership or sudden resource windfalls, can help identify the factors that contribute to or undermine institutional accountability and effectiveness. RCTs that evaluate interventions aimed at reducing corruption, improving bureaucratic performance, or enhancing citizen engagement can also provide valuable insights.

Ultimately, achieving SDG 16 requires a multi-pronged approach that combines rigorous empirical research with innovative policy design and effective implementation. As development economists, we must harness the power of causal inference methodologies to disentangle the complex relationships between peace, justice, and strong institutions, while remaining cognizant of the unique socio-political contexts in which interventions unfold. Only through a commitment to evidence-based policymaking can we hope to realize the transformative potential of SDG 16.
