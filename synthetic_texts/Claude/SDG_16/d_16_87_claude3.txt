Sustainable Development Goal 16 – Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels – lies at the heart of my life's work as an activist and advocate for marginalized communities. As someone who has experienced discrimination, violence, and denial of basic rights firsthand, I understand the profound impact that lack of access to justice and inclusive governance can have on individuals and societies.

Peace and inclusivity are intrinsically linked; without the latter, the former remains an elusive dream. Too often, we witness conflict, violence, and oppression stemming from systemic exclusion, inequity, and marginalization of certain groups based on their gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, religion, or other identities. The denial of fundamental human rights and equal access to justice perpetuates cycles of trauma, resentment, and social unrest, undermining the very foundations of sustainable development.

In my home country of India, the LGBTQ+ community has endured centuries of criminalization, stigma, and discrimination, directly impeding our ability to participate fully and equally in society. Despite the historic decriminalization of consensual same-sex relations in 2018, we continue to face widespread societal prejudice, legal barriers to marriage and adoption, and exclusion from critical areas such as employment, healthcare, and education. This systemic marginalization not only violates our fundamental human rights but also hinders our nation's progress toward inclusive and sustainable development.

Achieving SDG 16 requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the root causes of exclusion and injustice. It demands a comprehensive overhaul of legal frameworks, institutional structures, and societal norms that perpetuate discrimination and inequality. We must dismantle discriminatory laws, policies, and practices that deny marginalized communities access to justice, equal opportunities, and basic rights. This includes repealing archaic laws that criminalize identities or expressions, enacting comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation, and actively promoting diversity and inclusion in all spheres of life.

Equally crucial is the transformation of institutions and governance systems to ensure transparency, accountability, and meaningful participation of all stakeholders, particularly those who have been historically sidelined. We must foster inclusive decision-making processes that amplify the voices of marginalized communities and incorporate their perspectives and lived experiences. This requires active engagement, capacity-building, and empowerment of these groups to effectively advocate for their rights and shape policies that impact their lives.

Furthermore, promoting peaceful and inclusive societies necessitates a concerted effort to address the deeply entrenched societal attitudes, biases, and prejudices that fuel discrimination, violence, and exclusion. This involves comprehensive education and awareness campaigns, cultural interventions, and robust legal and social protections for marginalized groups. We must challenge harmful narratives, stereotypes, and norms that dehumanize or otherize certain identities, and foster a culture of respect, empathy, and celebration of diversity.

Achieving SDG 16 is not merely a moral imperative; it is a strategic imperative for sustainable development. Inclusive societies that uphold justice, equity, and human rights for all are more resilient, prosperous, and capable of addressing complex challenges. When marginalized communities are empowered, respected, and included, they can contribute their unique perspectives, talents, and experiences to the collective effort of building a better world.

As we strive to realize the ambitious aspirations of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we must recognize that our progress is inextricably linked to our commitment to upholding the principles enshrined in SDG 16. It is a call to action for all of us – governments, civil society, private sector, and individuals – to dismantle the barriers that divide us and embrace the strength that lies in our diversity. Only through inclusive, just, and peaceful societies can we truly achieve sustainable development that leaves no one behind.
