The pursuit of peace, justice, and inclusive societies lies at the heart of Sustainable Development Goal 16, an imperative that the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) recognizes as inextricably linked to its mandate of eradicating hunger, malnutrition, and poverty worldwide. The intricate nexus between food security, conflict, and governance cannot be overstated, as evidenced by the sobering reality that conflict-affected countries account for a staggering 24% of the world's undernourished population, despite comprising a mere 8% of the global populace.

In the face of escalating climate change impacts, environmental degradation, and resource scarcity, the risk of conflict over dwindling natural resources continues to mount, particularly in fragile regions grappling with weak governance structures and deep-rooted societal rifts. The FAO's engagement in conflict prevention, mitigation, and resolution has become an increasingly pivotal aspect of our work, as we strive to bolster resilient agricultural systems and promote inclusive, equitable access to productive resources.

One emblematic initiative that encapsulates our holistic approach is the Sustainable Livelihoods and Peacebuilding program, currently operational in the volatile regions of the Central African Republic, Mali, and South Sudan. Through this program, we engage diverse stakeholders, including government entities, civil society organizations, and local communities, in a concerted effort to address the root causes of conflict, foster social cohesion, and rebuild shattered livelihoods.

A cornerstone of our approach is the promotion of inclusive and participatory decision-making processes, empowering traditionally marginalized groups, such as women, youth, and indigenous communities, to actively participate in the governance of natural resources and the formulation of policies that affect their lives. By providing platforms for dialogue, mediation, and conflict resolution, we aim to defuse tensions and cultivate an environment conducive to sustainable development.

Furthermore, we recognize the inextricable link between access to productive resources, such as land and water, and the potential for conflict. Through initiatives like the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure, we provide a framework for equitable and transparent land tenure systems, mitigating disputes and promoting inclusive economic growth.

Capacity building and institutional strengthening are also critical components of our efforts, as we work to enhance the governance capabilities of national and local authorities, enabling them to effectively manage natural resources, uphold the rule of law, and combat corruption â€“ a pervasive scourge that undermines sustainable development efforts and erodes public trust.

However, our efforts extend far beyond the realms of conflict prevention and resolution. We recognize that the establishment of lasting peace and justice is contingent upon addressing the multifaceted drivers of instability, including food insecurity, poverty, and environmental degradation. To this end, we collaborate closely with partners across various sectors, promoting sustainable agricultural practices, enhancing market access for smallholder farmers, and fostering resilient rural livelihoods.

One such collaborative endeavor is the Global Alliance for Climate-Smart Agriculture, a multi-stakeholder platform that seeks to catalyze the adoption of climate-smart practices, fortifying food systems against the mounting pressures of climate change and resource scarcity, while simultaneously mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable land management.

Moreover, we remain steadfast in our commitment to upholding international standards and promoting transparency, accountability, and the rule of law. Through our normative work and capacity-building efforts, we strive to strengthen national and regional governance frameworks, ensuring inclusive, participatory decision-making processes, and fostering an enabling environment for sustainable development to flourish.

As we look toward the future, the inextricable links between SDG 16 and the other Sustainable Development Goals become increasingly apparent. Progress in eradicating poverty (SDG 1), achieving food security and sustainable agriculture (SDG 2), ensuring access to clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), promoting sustainable economic growth and decent work (SDG 8), and combating climate change (SDG 13) will all be contingent upon our collective ability to foster peaceful, just, and inclusive societies.

In this interconnected landscape, the FAO remains committed to leveraging its expertise, partnerships, and global reach to address the multifaceted challenges that impede the realization of SDG 16. Through innovative approaches, collaborative efforts, and a unwavering dedication to sustainable development, we will continue to strive for a world where peace, justice, and inclusive societies lay the foundation for a food-secure, prosperous, and resilient future for all.
