Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions), written from the perspective of Ben Shapiro:

The 16th Sustainable Development Goal put forth by the United Nations seeks to "promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels." On its face, this appears to be a laudable and essentially uncontroversial goal. Who could be against peace, justice, and good governance? 

However, we must scrutinize the ideological underpinnings and real-world implications of SDG 16. From a classical liberal perspective grounded in Judeo-Christian values and Enlightenment principles, the UN's approach is deeply flawed.

First, the notion of promoting "inclusive societies" is a Trojan horse for the radical left's equity agenda of enforced demographic representation across all societal institutions. True inequality of opportunity must be remedied. But equity—equality of outcomes achieved through discriminatory policies—is a perversion of the founding American principle of equal protection under the law regardless of race or background.

Next, the UN's conception of "justice" is heavily clouded by neo-Marxist critical theory that views human relations through the distorting lenses of power, oppression, and group identities. Justice is reinterpreted as correcting generalized "systemic" biases rather than upholding long-established individual rights and equality under the law. Traditional due process and evidentiary standards are increasingly disregarded in favor of race-conscious "restorative justice" practices more akin to tribal score-settling than the Anglo-American legal tradition.

This intersects with the third major flaw: the explicit institutional goal of centralized, top-down governance to be imposed on all levels of society, from local to national—precisely the sort of bureaucratic overreach the American republic was established to resist. Constitutional republicanism with separated powers was designed to prevent power from accumulating in any single authority that could then be weaponized against the populace. SDG 16 flouts these vital checks and balances.

Finally, the UN's SDGs in general stem from a fundamentally anti-capitalist, anti-western philosophical framework steeped in postmodern social theory. SDG 16 fits neatly into the broader authoritarian schema: by centralizing power and control under one monolithic supranational body, the UN and its intergovernmental apparatus can more seamlessly implement its agenda of global wealth redistribution and governance by unaccountable bureaucratic fiat.

For these reasons, SDG 16 represents not lofty ideals of freedom and human rights, but an ideological bait-and-switch that trades individual sovereignty for coercive statism. True justice and lasting societal peace can only be achieved through Constitutional conservatism that upholds liberty, due process, and equality under the law for citizens of all backgrounds. The UN's radical, neo-Marxist vision of "sustainability" must be firmly rejected in favor of advancing human rights, limited government, and free-market prosperity for all.
