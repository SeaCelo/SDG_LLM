The Center for Victims of Torture (CVT) is deeply committed to the realization of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16, which aims to "promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all, and build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels." As an organization that works tirelessly to heal the wounds of torture on individuals, their families, and communities, we recognize the intrinsic link between the prevention of torture, the promotion of human rights, and the achievement of sustainable peace and development.

Torture is a deliberate and systematic attack on the human dignity and integrity of individuals, often employed as a means of oppression, subjugation, and intimidation by authoritarian regimes, non-state armed groups, and other perpetrators of violence. Its consequences are far-reaching, extending beyond the physical and psychological trauma inflicted on survivors. Torture undermines the very foundations of just and inclusive societies, eroding the rule of law, weakening democratic institutions, and fostering an environment of fear, mistrust, and impunity.

To effectively address this scourge, a comprehensive and multifaceted approach is required, one that tackles the root causes of torture and builds resilient systems that protect human rights and uphold the principles of justice and accountability. SDG 16 provides a powerful framework for this endeavor, recognizing that sustainable development cannot be achieved without the establishment of peaceful, just, and inclusive societies.

One of the key targets of SDG 16 is the reduction of all forms of violence and related death rates (Target 16.1). This is a critical objective in the context of torture, as it calls for concerted efforts to prevent and combat this heinous practice, while also addressing the underlying drivers of conflict, oppression, and human rights violations that often precipitate torture. To achieve this, robust legal frameworks, effective law enforcement, and credible mechanisms for accountability and redress must be put in place.

In this regard, the Center for Victims of Torture commends the efforts of countries and organizations that have taken concrete steps to criminalize torture, establish independent monitoring bodies, and provide access to justice and reparations for survivors. However, we must acknowledge that much work remains to be done, particularly in regions plagued by protracted conflicts, authoritarian rule, and weak governance structures.

Another crucial aspect of SDG 16 is the promotion of the rule of law and equal access to justice for all (Target 16.3). Torture thrives in environments where the rule of law is weak or non-existent, and where impunity reigns supreme. By strengthening legal and judicial systems, empowering civil society organizations, and fostering a culture of accountability, we can create an environment that is inhospitable to torture and other human rights violations.

The Center for Victims of Torture has witnessed firsthand the transformative power of justice and accountability in the healing process of survivors. When perpetrators are brought to account, and when survivors are afforded the opportunity to seek redress, it not only validates their suffering but also reinforces the fundamental principles of human rights and the inherent dignity of all individuals.

Furthermore, SDG 16 recognizes the importance of building effective, accountable, and transparent institutions at all levels (Target 16.6). Torture often thrives in opaque and unaccountable systems, where power is concentrated in the hands of a few, and where checks and balances are non-existent or ineffective. By promoting good governance, fostering transparency, and ensuring the participation of all stakeholders, including civil society organizations and survivors themselves, we can create institutions that are resilient to corruption, abuse, and the erosion of human rights.

The Center for Victims of Torture has long advocated for the inclusion of survivors' voices in the formulation of policies and programs aimed at preventing torture and promoting healing and reconciliation. Their lived experiences and insights are invaluable in informing effective strategies and ensuring that interventions are culturally sensitive and responsive to the unique needs of diverse communities.

Moreover, SDG 16 emphasizes the importance of promoting and protecting fundamental freedoms, in accordance with international human rights law (Target 16.10). Torture is often used as a means to silence dissent, repress political opposition, and stifle the free expression of ideas and beliefs. By safeguarding fundamental freedoms, we create an environment where individuals can participate freely in the political, economic, and social spheres, without fear of reprisal or persecution.

In conclusion, the achievement of SDG 16 is intrinsically linked to the eradication of torture and the promotion of human rights. As the Center for Victims of Torture, we recognize the multifaceted nature of this challenge and the need for a holistic approach that addresses the root causes of torture, strengthens legal and institutional frameworks, promotes accountability and access to justice, and empowers survivors and civil society organizations.
