Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 16 on peace, justice and strong institutions, written from the perspective of Peter Hitchens:

The Mirage of Sustainable Development Goal 16

By Peter Hitchens

The modern era's obsession with utopian visions knows no bounds. Despite centuries of evidence that human nature remains immutable and man's facility for conflict inextinguishable, the idealistic wheelers and dealers of the United Nations have conjured yet another quixotic campaign to rid the world of its imperfections. This one masquerades as the deceptively plausible "Sustainable Development Goal 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions." On its face, who could object to such lofty aims? But peel back the layers and a more sinister agenda emerges – one rooted in the dangerous progressive conceits that have unleashed such devastation.

At its core, SDG 16 is a flamboyant exercise in statist aggrandizement. The very first target calls for reducing "all forms of violence and related death rates everywhere." A noble thought, but what contortions of liberty might Leviathan justify to achieve this end? Any serious student of history understands that the state's monopoly on violence has accounted for exponentially more bloodshed than private criminality. With chilling regularity, governments of every ideological bent have turned against their own citizens in spasms of mass murder and oppressive brutality. 

The Soviet killing fields, Maoist purges, Rwandan genocide – all were precisely enabled by the existence of "strong institutions" in service of totalitarian regimes. Indeed, the very notion that peace can be centrally administered by unaccountable organizations like the UN is the epitome of arrogant folly. Peace is the natural condition that arises when human rights are protected and noxious concentrations of power are prevented. True justice stems from moral order, not bureaucratic diktat.

Which brings us to the statist fantasy of a "rule-based order," encapsulated in Target 16.3 to "promote the rule of law at the national and international levels." Hidden in this opaque jargon is a blueprint for global governance that erodes democratic sovereignty. We've seen this game before – a cabal of self-appointed transnational elites weaving a labyrinth of regulations, policies, and judicial fiats to override national prerogatives. It's the European Union model extended to planetary scale, enthralling domestic legal systems to unelected and unaccountable Star Chambers.

This governance schema leans hard on amorphous bromides like "access to justice for all" and "effective, accountable and transparent institutions." But who defines these malleable terms? And what constraints will be imposed on free peoples under such a presumptively enlightened but inevitably corruptible power structure? Make no mistake – the true aim is to subsume individual rights within a draconian planetary legal order rationalized as sustainable development.

Of course, the UN pooh-bahs can't sell this power grab though blunt authoritarianism. No, it's garbed instead in the pious raiment of lofty ideals and focus-grouped jargon like "responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels." But what sane person truly believes decisions impacting billions can be effectively centralized on a global scale? Incompetence, graft and calcified bureaucracy are inevitable consequences when vision outstrips the constraints of human capacity.

At a more fundamental level, Goal 16 exposes the modern bien pensant religion of historical determinism – that man is somehow inevitably evolving toward an earthly nirvana through the application of correct policies and systems. It's the religious faith of our age, promising a materialist's Eden if only we accept the divine wisdom of anointed technocrat archons. 

Yet like all such dogmatic creeds, it collides with the realities of man's immutable nature. Just observe the descent into nepotism, profiteering and authoritarian excess that attends every utopian campaign, however ostensibly virtuous its original aims. Without external accountability, unchecked power inevitably accrues to insiders claiming possession of absolute truth. A more prudent, conservative path recognizes that justice and peace are precarious daily achievements, hard-won through individual moral striving rather than worldly scheme-crafting. 

The Sustainable Development Goals are grand exercises in self-delusion, academic thought experiments masquerading as action plans. In their zeal to transcend the eternal human predicament, they peddle false hope that systems and bureaucracies can somehow immanentize the eschaton. Reality is far less seductive – our world remains irreducibly flawed, conflict indelibly etched into the fabric of divided societies and imperfect natures. Responsible stewards accept this friction rather than chase deliriums of perfectibility.
