Here is a fictional academic article on SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions, written from the perspective of the renowned author and humorist Russell Baker:

A Society Worthy of the Name: Examining SDG 16 Through a Satirical Lens

As the great American philosopher Larry Wilcox once proclaimed, "Justice, like plasma TV screens and hot fudge sundaes, is something we want everybody to have but nobody to get more of than anybody else." Seldom have truer words been spoken about the challenges inherent in Sustainable Development Goal 16 – that deceptively simple call for peaceful, just societies and capable institutions to serve them. 

After all, who could object to such lofty ambitions? Peace and justice rank right up there with adorable puppies and ice cream as human universals embraced across cultures. Yet as any casual observer of the modern world can attest, the path to realizing these ideals globally resembles one of Dante's corkscrew descents into Inferno more than an amble along Elysian Fields.

Even in ostensibly peaceful nations with sturdy judicial systems, grave injustices persist. The United States judicial branch, traditionally regarded as a model of impartiality, has seen its credibility rattled recently amid claims of partisan trifling and shockingly poor judgment by esteemed jurists who somehow overlooked the impropriety of accepting lavish gifts and hospitality from wealthy benefactors.

But simple venality represents only one hurdle in erecting judicial systems worthy of citizens' trust. More intractable are cultural foundations of prejudice and inequity which predispose societies against impartial administration of justice. Consider the mockeries of due process which persist in many nations where religious or ethnic minorities are systematically victimized, or where antiquated patriarchal biases deprive women and girls of basic rights.

Entrenched kleptocracies and their attendant cultures of corruption and graft present another formidable obstacle to SDG 16's pursuit of transparent, accountable public institutions capable of upholding the rule of law. From nepotistic nightmares like the administration which recently presided over South Sudan's descent into famine and civil war, to wealthy nations where monied elites have bent legislative bodies to serve their narrow interests through campaign finance chicanery, self-serving governance imperils justice just as surely as ideological zealotry or ethnic chauvinism.

As we survey this dispiriting global landscape, despair may beckon. But to surrender to cynicism on SDG 16 is to forsake our very essence as rational beings capable of progress. For what separates humans from the beasts, other than ill-advised fashion choices and insatiable sweet tooths, if not our ability to construct societal systems of cooperation – however imperfect – in collective pursuit of justice, peace and good governance?

Furthermore, even seemingly incremental strides toward these goals can catalyze cascading benefits across multiple fronts of sustainable development. Bolstering institutional capacities for anti-corruption and transparent resource management, for instance, serves not only to uphold human rights but to protect the environment by impeding the sort of rapacious over-exploitation which has befouled vast regions. Inclusive, impartial judicial systems foster economic opportunity by providing fair redress against monopolistic practices and empowering entrepreneurs to pursue commercial visions without fear of expropriation.

In many developing nations, SDG 16's targets of reducing illicit arms flows, combatting organized crime, and fostering independent anti-corruption agencies represent critical first steps – daunting though they may be – toward creating climates conducive to broader progress. Building effective public service institutions staffed by merit-based professionals rather than cronyistic patronage appointees offers another foundational prerequisite.

More broadly, pursuing SDG 16's sweeping agenda will require evolving our very mindsets about what constitutes effective governance. Antiquated "might makes right" power paradigms which codify injustice and inflame conflicts must ultimately yield to more enlightened frameworks recognizing all humanity's shared, fundamental rights and universal human dignity.

It's an ambitious agenda to be sure, this SDG clarion call for justice, durable institutions and peaceful co-existence across all nations and peoples. But then ambition has never been something our species has lacked. From dreaming up those inaugural sundaes smothered in molten chocolate to conceiving ever-larger screen TVs to gaze at from our La-Z-Boy thrones, we humans possess a remarkable proclivity for concocting new pinnacles of achievement to scale.

Here's hoping we apply that dogged aspiration toward constructing more perfect societal systems of good governance as well...if only to ensure future generations can enjoy those hot fudge toppings and plasma viewing experiences without autocrats or extremists spoiling the party.
