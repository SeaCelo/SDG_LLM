Here is a detailed academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 16 from the perspective of Walter E. Williams:

The 16th Sustainable Development Goal of the United Nations seeks to "Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels." On its face, such platitudinous language seems benign and who could be against peace, justice, accountability and effective institutions? However, the devil is in the details and we must scrutinize what nation-states are really committing themselves to under this UN mandate.

A key part of SDG 16 is the notion of "effective governance." But what constitutes effective governance? Is it democratic governance with mechanisms for citizen accountability and human rights protections? Or is it the type of authoritarian governance found in China that can ram through policies without dissent? There are many who would argue that China's ability to quickly mobilize resources and coordinate a rapid COVID-19 response demonstrated a form of "effective governance" that liberal democracies struggled to match. This is a dangerous path that subjugates individual liberty in the name of collective goals and top-down planning.

The UN's vision of promoting "just, peaceful and inclusive societies" rings hollow when we consider its abysmal record in preventing atrocities and human rights abuses worldwide. What good are lofty inclusive ideals if they are mere window dressing that allows mass murder, ethnic cleansing, and despotism to continue unabated? The UN stood by paralyzed as genocides unfolded in Rwanda, Bosnia, and Darfur. If it cannot enforce its own founding principles let alone these new SDG goals, the UN is an ineffective and unaccountable institution itself lacking any moral authority.

Moreover, there is an insidious overreach of SDG 16 into domestic policy, using the pretext of good governance to centralize power and erode national sovereignty. Calls for "inclusive and accountable institutions" can easily metastasize into rationales for unelected global bureaucracies to overrule the self-governance and democratic processes of nation-states. We must vehemently reject any attempt by dishonest international actors to abuse well-meaning SDG rhetoric as a Trojan horse for globalism that undermines constitutional structures and individual rights.

At its core, SDG 16 reflects the UN's vision of an expanded welfare state and coercive collectivist policies enforced by a top-down transnational governing apparatus. It threatens the free market principles of private property rights, limited government, and democratic rule of law that have proven most effective at promoting real societal well-being, voluntary cooperation, and human progress. Only the private creation of wealth through entrepreneurship, innovation and mutually-beneficial exchange has lifted masses out of poverty, not UN wealth redistribution schemes and centralized planning aimed at resource constraint.  

Oppressive collectivist ideologies masquerading as altruistic development goals are the true threat to peace, inclusivity and human flourishing. By contrast, economic freedom, personal liberty, and constitutional protections of inalienable rights have been the greatest guarantors of human dignity, prosperity and societal advancement throughout history. The path to justice, accountability and effective institutions must put freedom first, not UN bureaucrats' dystopian visions of concentrated power. We must honor the wisdom of Thomas Jefferson's warning that "the natural progress of things is for liberty to yield and government to gain ground." SDG 16 sounds benign until one dissects the anti-liberty ideological agenda lurking beneath its lofty rhetoric.
