The Sustainable Development Goal 16, which aims to "promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels," remains a pivotal endeavor for nations across the globe. As the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), we recognize the intrinsic link between sustainable development and the establishment of robust, transparent, and equitable governance structures.

In our analysis, we have observed a concerning trend of democratic backsliding in several countries within our operational sphere. This regression manifests itself in various forms, including the erosion of checks and balances, the concentration of power, and the curtailment of civil liberties. Such developments pose a significant threat to the achievement of SDG 16, as they undermine the very foundations upon which peaceful and inclusive societies are built.

Furthermore, the persistence of corruption, both at the institutional and individual levels, continues to impede progress towards the attainment of this goal. Corrupt practices not only distort the allocation of resources and hinder economic growth but also breed public mistrust in governance structures, thereby exacerbating social tensions and fueling instability.

Addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses legislative reforms, institutional capacity building, and the empowerment of civil society organizations. We must prioritize the strengthening of independent judicial systems, ensuring that access to justice is not merely a theoretical construct but a tangible reality for all citizens, regardless of their socioeconomic status or political affiliations.

Effective accountability mechanisms are paramount in this endeavor. By fostering transparency and subjecting decision-makers to public scrutiny, we can enhance the responsiveness and legitimacy of institutions, thereby fostering greater trust and collaboration between the governed and those who govern.

Moreover, we must recognize the inextricable link between SDG 16 and other Sustainable Development Goals. Poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation can act as catalysts for social unrest and conflict, eroding the foundations of peaceful and inclusive societies. Conversely, the achievement of SDG 16 can serve as a powerful enabler for progress across the entire 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

In this context, we must embrace a holistic approach that addresses the root causes of instability and promotes sustainable, equitable, and inclusive development. This may involve investing in education and capacity-building programs, fostering economic opportunities, and promoting environmental sustainability â€“ all of which contribute to the creation of resilient, cohesive societies.

It is imperative to acknowledge that the path towards achieving SDG 16 is not a linear one. Setbacks and obstacles are inevitable, and we must remain vigilant and adaptable in our strategies. By fostering international cooperation, sharing best practices, and leveraging the collective expertise of various stakeholders, we can navigate these challenges more effectively.

The EBRD remains committed to supporting our partner countries in their pursuit of SDG 16. Through targeted investments, policy dialogue, and technical assistance, we aim to catalyze transformative change and nurture an environment conducive to the flourishing of peaceful, just, and inclusive societies.
