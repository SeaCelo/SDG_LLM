The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) recognizes Sustainable Development Goal 16 (SDG 16) as a critical enabler for sustainable development, underpinning the achievement of all other goals. This report offers an in-depth analysis of the progress, challenges, and opportunities associated with promoting peaceful and inclusive societies, providing access to justice, and building effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels.

Over the past decade, substantial progress has been made in several areas, including the reduction of violence and conflict-related deaths, efforts to combat corruption, and the promotion of fundamental freedoms. However, persistent challenges remain, particularly in fragile and conflict-affected states, where weak governance, insecurity, and human rights violations continue to undermine sustainable development efforts.

The OECD recognizes the inextricable link between peace, justice, and inclusive institutions, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive and integrated approach to addressing these interrelated issues. Effective governance structures, the rule of law, and access to justice are essential for ensuring accountability, protecting human rights, and fostering an enabling environment for sustainable development.

Corruption remains a pervasive global challenge, undermining trust in institutions, diverting resources from essential services, and exacerbating inequality and poverty. The OECD has been at the forefront of efforts to combat corruption, promoting transparency, integrity, and accountability through various initiatives, such as the Anti-Bribery Convention and the Recommendation on Public Integrity.

However, addressing corruption requires a multifaceted approach that goes beyond legal frameworks and enforcement mechanisms. It necessitates a fundamental shift in societal norms, values, and behaviors, fostering a culture of integrity at all levels of society. The OECD emphasizes the importance of engaging key stakeholders, including civil society, the private sector, and marginalized communities, in the fight against corruption.

Access to justice remains a significant challenge, particularly for vulnerable and marginalized groups, including women, children, minorities, and individuals living in poverty. Barriers to justice, such as legal complexity, procedural hurdles, and limited access to legal representation, perpetuate cycles of inequality and impede the realization of human rights.

The OECD recognizes the critical role of independent and impartial judicial systems in upholding the rule of law and ensuring equal access to justice. Initiatives such as the OECD's Judicial Integrity Framework and the ongoing work on legal empowerment aim to strengthen judicial institutions, promote transparency, and enhance access to justice for all.

Furthermore, the OECD emphasizes the importance of inclusive and participatory decision-making processes, recognizing that effective and accountable institutions must be responsive to the needs and aspirations of all citizens. Inclusive governance structures, coupled with robust mechanisms for public participation and stakeholder engagement, are vital for fostering trust, ensuring accountability, and promoting sustainable development.

In fragile and conflict-affected contexts, the OECD acknowledges the complex challenges posed by insecurity, weak governance, and human rights violations. Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive and context-specific approach that prioritizes conflict prevention, peacebuilding efforts, and the promotion of inclusive and participatory governance structures.

The OECD's commitment to SDG 16 is evident in its ongoing efforts to promote good governance, combat corruption, enhance access to justice, and foster inclusive and participatory decision-making processes. Through its policy guidance, peer reviews, and technical assistance, the OECD aims to support member and partner countries in their efforts to achieve the targets set forth under SDG 16, ultimately contributing to the overarching goal of sustainable development.
