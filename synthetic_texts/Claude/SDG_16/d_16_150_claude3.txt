The Crucial Quest for Peace, Justice and Governance: An Uncompromising Look at SDG 16

By Mona Charen

While the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals rightly aim to uplift humanity through ambitious targets for health, education, gender equality and more, none may be as fundamental as SDG 16 - the promotion of peaceful and inclusive societies, access to justice, and accountable institutions. Without a bedrock of law, order, and just governance, all other development objectives are imperiled.  

We've seen the bitter fruits of anarchy, tribalism, and failed states played out tragically in regions plagued by warlords, militias, narco-traffickers and terrorists. The displacement of innocents, collapse of social orders, and metastasizing violence and oppression are inevitable when institutions break down. Civilized society depends utterly on a robust legal framework and legitimate monopoly on force. Transnational threats like extremism, human trafficking, weapons proliferation and cyber-attacks demand capable, ethical law enforcement and intelligence services.  

The rule of law is a rampart against those malign forces – not just a noble idea, but the foundation of human rights and economic progress. It's no accident that the freest, wealthiest, healthiest nations rank highest on indices of good governance and transparent, democratic institutions. Property rights, freedom of speech and religion, racial and gender equality – none can be secured without clear rule of law and procedures for peaceful transfers of power. Economic investment, business formation, and entrepreneurship require assurance that contracts will be enforced and property protected.

Corruption is the polar opposite – the thief of human potential. When officials can be bribed, malign actors enriched, and the public trust broken, the entire social fabric shatters. At best, nations descend into cronyism and graft. At worst, bloodshed and conflict erupt over power vacuums and inequality. That's why enhancing transparency, enacting strong anti-corruption measures, and fortifying judicial independence are such vital components of SDG 16.

Of course, long-suffering populations do not have the luxury of awaiting gradual reforms. Brutal regimes like those in North Korea, Syria, Myanmar and too many others cling to power through brute force, operating gulags, persecuting minorities and dissidents, and flattening all checks and balances. In such cases, it falls to the broader international community to marshal sanctions, provide aid to civil society groups, document atrocities, and create safe harbors. Accountability, not impunity, must become the global norm.

SDG 16 also challenges nations to reduce all forms of violence, prevent arms flows into unstable zones, counter terrorist financing, and ensure legal identity and birth registration for all people – no small tasks. But if humanity hopes to bend the long arc toward justice and lasting peace, strong democratic institutions and effective rule of law are prerequisites. Lawless regions become ungoverned incubators of transnational crime, conflict, and even pandemics. Stability is a global public good.

Naturally, SDG 16's embrace of "inclusive societies" must apply within nations too. Marginalized groups like indigenous peoples, migrants, LGBTQ individuals and other vulnerable populations must have access to justice, political voice, and freedom from discrimination if nations hope to remain cohesive and prosperous. Diversity may enrich a society, but only if a spirit of mutual tolerance and equal rights is zealously cultivated – and enforced.

There will always be anti-democratic malcontents who equate pluralism with disorder. But tyrannical governments quickly reveal their true nature through human rights abuses, rigged elections, censorship of speech, tampering with judiciaries, and demonization of minorities. More subtly, illiberal creep manifests in consolidation of power, repression of civil society, and perversions of rule of law. Both overt and insidious assaults on inclusive societies must be resisted with moral clarity.  

Despite disheartening conflict hotspots and crises of governance in too many nations, the global trajectory has been toward greater freedom, rule of law, and democratic institutions over recent decades. Non-governmental organizations, journalists, and citizens have leveraged technology to shed light on abuses, marshal activism, and demand accountability. Standing athwart this positive historical current are resurgent authoritarians and ethno-nationalists who propagate bigoted tribalism over universal rights. They are the enemies of peace, justice, and strong institutions that SDG 16 enshrines.

Those inclined toward democratic norms and the primacy of human rights must not waver in defense of pluralistic, law-abiding societies with robust constraints on power. The United Nations' SDG 16 reminds us that this bedrock civilizational principle remains a work in constant progress – one requiring sustained courage and commitment against the ever-present forces of chaos, repression, and mankind's basest impulses. Freedom, equality before the law, and just governance may be ideals, but they are ideals worth fighting to advance in every nation under heaven.
