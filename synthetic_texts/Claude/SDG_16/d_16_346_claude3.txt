The Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID) has centered its efforts on Sustainable Development Goal 16 (SDG 16), which focuses on promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, providing access to justice for all, and building effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels. This goal is fundamental for advancing the other SDGs, as genuine sustainable development is unattainable without peace, stability, human rights, and strong institutions.

In recent years, AECID has closely collaborated with partner countries in various regions, particularly those affected by armed conflicts, political instability, and institutional fragility. Our efforts have focused on strengthening judicial and security institutions, fostering citizen participation in decision-making processes, promoting transparency and accountability, and protecting the human rights of the most vulnerable groups.

Regional Highlights
Central America
AECID has worked with local organizations to combat violence related to gangs and drug trafficking, providing support to victims and promoting social reintegration programs for at-risk youth. Additionally, we have contributed to strengthening the judicial system in the region, training judges, prosecutors, and lawyers in areas such as due process, anti-corruption efforts, and the protection of Indigenous peoples' rights.

The Sahel
In this region plagued by violent extremism and interethnic conflicts, AECID has collaborated with local authorities and United Nations peace missions to promote intercommunity dialogue and peaceful dispute resolution. We have also supported rural development and women's economic empowerment initiatives, recognizing that marginalization and lack of opportunities fuel radicalization and instability.

Governance in Latin America and the Caribbean
AECID has worked closely with public institutions to improve transparency and accountability. We have provided technical assistance for implementing public information access laws, digitizing government services, and training officials in ethics and anti-corruption practices.

Persistent Challenges
Despite notable progress, numerous challenges remain in achieving SDG 16. Armed conflicts, terrorism, organized crime, and endemic corruption continue to undermine peace, justice, and institutions in many parts of the world. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated inequalities and tested the resilience of judicial and security systems.

AECIDâ€™s Multidimensional Approach
To address these challenges, AECID has adopted a multidimensional approach combining technical assistance, financial cooperation, and political dialogue. We recognize that building peaceful and inclusive societies requires not only institutional strengthening but also addressing the root causes of violence, injustice, and inequality.

Key priorities include:

Rural Development, Education, and Youth Opportunities: Investing in these areas to prevent conflict and foster social cohesion.
Civil Society Participation: Promoting meaningful involvement of civil society, including women's organizations and Indigenous peoples, in decision-making processes and peacebuilding efforts.
Collaboration with International Actors: Strengthening partnerships with the United Nations, the European Union, and other international cooperation agencies to deliver coordinated and coherent responses to global challenges.
AECID's Contributions to Global Peace Efforts
AECID has enhanced its collaboration with UN peacekeeping missions and operations, supporting areas such as demining, security sector reform, and civilian protection. We are also engaged in addressing the socio-economic drivers of conflict by fostering dialogue, inclusive policies, and development-oriented solutions.

Conclusion
SDG 16 is a strategic priority for AECID. Our efforts focus on promoting peaceful, just, and inclusive societies in regions most affected by conflict, instability, and institutional fragility. Through a combination of technical assistance, financial cooperation, and political dialogue, we are contributing to institutional strengthening, peace promotion, and human rights protection. However, we recognize that these are long-term and complex challenges requiring sustained commitment and innovative approaches to address the underlying causes of violence and injustice.
