Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions), written from the perspective of Niki Savva, an Australian political commentator and author:

When it comes to Sustainable Development Goal 16 - promoting peaceful and inclusive societies, providing access to justice, and building effective, accountable institutions - Australia has a patchy record at best. As a nation that prides itself on its stable democracy and adherence to the rule of law, we like to think we're setting a good example on the global stage. But the reality is that our political argy-bargy and frequent leadership spills have made us an international laughingstock in recent years.  

Take our cavalier attitude toward human rights and the treatment of asylum seekers, for instance. Keeping refugees locked up indefinitely in offshore detention centers on Manus Island and Nauru, with credible reports of abuses and appalling conditions, makes a mockery of our commitment to justice and international humanitarian law. When the UN raised concerns, our politicians basically told them to butt out. Much like the US with Guantanamo Bay, we seem to think such human rights violations are justifiable in the name of "border security." It's the kind of authoritarian overreach you'd expect from corrupt, unaccountable regimes - not a modern democracy.

And what about indigenous incarceration rates that are among the highest in the world? The malignant racism and systemic disadvantage facing Aboriginal communities is itself a tragic indictment of our failure to provide equal access to justice and opportunity for all citizens. Political rhetoric around "closing the gap" has been just that - all rhetoric, no action. We remain a nation where the original inhabitants still struggle to have their basic rights and dignity recognized by arrogant policymakers stuck in the colonial era.

Even putting aside our domestic shortcomings, Australia's international policy choices have frequently undermined the vital SDG 16 targets around peace, rule of law, and transparency. Our unquestioning military support for the US invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq - which violated international law and destabilized entire regions - was deeply misguided. Not to mention our leading role in spying on Pacific neighbors like Timor-Leste to gain commercial advantages during negotiations. Hardly the actions of a nation committed to peaceful and ethical resolution of disputes.    

And let's not forget "The Canberra Bubble" itself - the toxic workplace culture in our national parliament that has enabled sexual harassment, misogyny, and abuse of power to fester unchecked for decades. The mind-boggling revelations of bad behavior by cabinet ministers, staffers, and party powerbrokers read like a tawdry airport novel about dysfunctional institutions run by reckless "Machomen." Hardly the accountable, transparent, and inclusive governance that SDG 16 envisions.

In many ways, our political elite is too often populated by narcissistic personalities focused on internal power games, ideological tribalism, and self-preservation - not ethics, justice, or service to the people. Too many pollies see accountability and anti-corruption measures as mere impediments to their grubby ambitions rather than pillars of good governance. 

It will take a seismic shift in priorities and attitudes to bring Australia's domestic laws and foreign policy agenda into genuine alignment with SDG 16. A renewed commitment to human rights, social equity, transparency, and placing the national interest ahead of partisan squabbles. Abolishing archaic parliamentary conventions that shelter bad behavior. And perhaps most critically, overhauling our rancorous political culture to elevate integrity, ethics, and principled service above the endless tactical game-playing.

Only then can we credibly claim to be helping "promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels."  Until then, SDG 16 remains an embarrassing reminder of how far we still have to go.
