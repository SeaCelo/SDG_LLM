Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) written from the perspective of Clarence Page, the nationally syndicated columnist:

"We hold these truths to be self-evident," wrote Thomas Jefferson, "that all men are created equal." Those ringing words from the Declaration of Independence helped to inspire revolutions across the world in the name of human rights, democracy and the rule of law. Yet more than 240 years later, Jefferson's noble sentiments remain tragically unrealized for far too many.

That sobering reality is one of the driving forces behind the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 16 - to "promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels."

The imperative for peace and justice could not be more urgent. Around the globe, authoritarian regimes brutally repress their citizens, violent extremists spread terror through barbaric acts, and corrupt leaders enrich themselves at the expense of their nations' development. Even long-established democracies struggle with systemic racial injustice, economic inequality, political polarization and threats to electoral integrity.  

In such a volatile climate, SDG 16 is not just an aspirational target, but an existential necessity if we hope to create a more equitable and sustainable world for all of humanity. At its core, this goal reflects the hard-won lessons that peace and development are inextricably linked - and that neither can exist without strong institutions that uphold the rule of law and protect human rights.

Consider the strife-torn nations where lawless warlords reign and sectarian militias ravage entire regions with impunity. Economic development withers while billions are squandered on arms and conflict. Schools, hospitals and infrastructure crumble from neglect amidst the constant hail of mortars and gunfire. With no faith in their discredited institutions, desperate citizens flee by the millions as refugees.  

By contrast, where the rule of law and democratic norms prevail - however imperfectly - nations have the stability to attract investment, educate their workforces, build modern infrastructure and establish social safety nets. Critically, they also empower citizens as stakeholders with voice and agency over their communities and futures.

The interconnected targets under SDG 16 cut to the heart of this vision: reducing all forms of violence, battling corruption and organized crime, protecting fundamental rights, strengthening participatory institutions and ensuring access to justice. Each of these is an indispensable pillar for sustaining peace, unlocking human potential and enabling economic progress.

Of course, such a sweeping agenda will require unprecedented global cooperation across NGOs, multilateral institutions, civil society and national governments. In that spirit, SDG 16 specifically calls for bolstering partnerships to achieve its ambitious targets by 2030.  

The roadblocks are daunting - from authoritarian backlashes and rising ethno-nationalism to rampant misinformation that corrodes public trust. In response, proponents champion multi-stakeholder coalitions to independently monitor progress, share best practices and exert accountability.

Skeptics dismiss the goal as a utopian fantasy, noting that not even so-called "liberal democracies" have fully upheld these ideals in practice. It's a fair critique - and one that underscores the vital importance of this unfinished work. 

For as the United States wrestles with its own shortcomings on voting rights, policing, judicial equity and more, we are reminded that no nation is immune to the forces of injustice, oppression and democratic backsliding. SDG 16 is a clarion call to rededicate ourselves to this eternal struggle - society's never-ending journey toward achieving the universal human yearning for peace, dignity and rights.

If the 20th century was shaped by the Cold War's dueling ideologies, the 21st may well be defined by this existential battle for democracy itself against the authoritarian tide. With consensus fraying even among Western allies, reaffirming the international rule of law has taken on piquant urgency.

In that sense, SDG 16 represents much more than an aspirational compact. It stands as a provocative rebuke to an age of resurgent nationalism, cynical power politics and the erosion of democratic norms. 

A half-century ago, the Civil Rights Movement's heroic struggles helped to redeem America's national creed and advance human rights worldwide. Today, our caustic polarities and battered civic strengths have frayed those hard-won gains. Rejuvenating the principles of SDG 16 - both at home and abroad - could mark a worthy inheritors' cause for the 21st century's justice journey.

For as the world's diverse cultures and religions affirm in their own enduring truths, the most meaningful human quests are bound to the moral arc that bends eternal toward justice. SGD 16 aspires to nothing less than hastening that arc's journey for all humanity. It is an ambition to which we should rededicate ourselves.
