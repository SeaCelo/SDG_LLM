Here is a draft newspaper article about SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) as if written for Fast Company magazine:

Breaking the Cycle of Injustice: The Visionary Path to Sustainable Peace and Prosperity

By Jennifer Graham, Contributing Editor

The world is at a tipping point. From simmering civil conflicts to human rights abuses, weak governance to corrosive corruption - the cycle of injustice is stifling progress on a global scale. But a revolution is stirring, one that leverages the transformative power of sustainable development to upend the status quo. At its heart? SDG 16 - the deceptively simple yet profoundly ambitious goal of promoting just, peaceful and inclusive societies.

Make no mistake, this is no idealistic pipe dream. It's a strategic economic and ethical imperative backed by cold, hard numbers. The annual cost of armed conflict? A staggering $14.3 trillion and rising. Public sector corruption bleeds $1.26 trillion from developing nations each year, crippling growth and undermining essential services. Worldwide, one in three workers experience workplace harassment or violence - a scourge that impedes productivity and talent retention.  

Inversely, the economic dividends of peace are exponential. Every $1 invested in prevention reaps a $16 return by averting conflict costs. Unshackling the restraints of violence and insecurity could unleash an estimated $7.1 trillion in new global economic activity. The SDG 16 blueprint is simple yet revolutionary: disrupt the perpetual cycles of violence, graft and oppression by strengthening governance, upholding human rights, and hardwiring justice and accountability into all institutions - public and private.  

At the vanguard of this transformation? A bold coalition of innovative thinkers, visionary leaders and activist entrepreneurs dead-set on hacking the broken systems that breed conflict, corruption and inequity. Take The Elders, where iconic changemakers like Mary Robinson and Ban Ki-moon leverage their moral authority to resolve conflicts, share wisdom and catalyze peace worldwide. Or Accountability Lab, an impact startup catalyzing a new generation of accountability efforts by empowering local communities to battle corruption. From El Salvador to Mongolia, their creative initiatives like corruption 'street theaters' and accountability incubators are hardwiring integrity into governance.

Buttressing these efforts, cutting-edge technologies are also disrupting the injustice status quo. Mobile games like Lauchinpoly are immunizing youth against corruption by simulating the ethical dilemmas they'll face. Geospatial data is being weaponized in Kenya and Paraguay to map justice deserts and redeploy law enforcement to the most underserved areas. And in conflict zones, social media forensics and smartphone videos are preserving evidence of human rights atrocities to uphold accountability.

Of course, monumental challenges remain - from ending police brutality to deterring dictatorships and environmental exploitation. But the convergence of committed changemakers, digital innovation and shifting mindsets is unleashing powerful momentum behind SDG 16's rallying cry for an equitable, just and peaceful world.  

It's a vision unimagined before the SDG era, yet now within reach: An end to the stranglehold of corruption, conflict and exclusion. A world where all can safely walk the streets, access fair justice and raise their voice without fear of reprisal. A global renaissance of human dignity, fueled by ethical governance and grounded in inalienable rights. It's an audacious dream - but thanks to SDG 16's catalyzing agenda, it's fast becoming reality. The cycle of injustice is poised to shatter once and for all, ushering in a prosperous new era of sustainable peace.
