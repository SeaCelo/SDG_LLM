Here is a detailed academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 16 from the perspective of Bj√∏rn Lomborg:

Establishing Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions: A Pragmatic Critique of SDG 16

Sustainable Development Goal 16 sets out the noble aim of "promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, providing access to justice for all and building effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels." While the underlying moral imperative is laudable, a sober cost-benefit analysis reveals some deeply problematic assumptions and unrealistic targets underlying this goal. 

From a pure economic perspective, one could argue that conflict, corruption and weak governance are actually positive drivers of global GDP growth in the short-term. The military-industrial complexes and sprawling networks of bribery and graft keep billions of dollars flowing through the world economy. Resources are constantly being reallocated to the highest bidder, irrespective of ethics. Does this grease the wheels of capitalism more efficiently than bureaucratic red tape and legal niceties? Conflict has hastened technological innovation throughout history as civilizations raced to develop superior weapons. Perhaps some level of instability and violence is a necessary catalyst for human progress.

That said, such a morally bankrupt worldview is simply untenable in the long run. The immense human suffering caused by violence, oppression and institutional failure imposes catastrophic social and economic costs that inevitably outweigh any ephemeral gains. Just look at the statistics - the World Bank estimates that the average cost of a civil war is equivalent to 60 years of GDP growth for a developing country. Chronic conflict reversers hard-won development achievements, decimating infrastructure, disrupting markets, decimating human capital and capital investment. High levels of corruption and opacity destroy public trust, hamstringing efforts to build prosperous, high-trust societies. Durable peace and inclusive, transparent governance are fundamental prerequisites for sustainable, multidimensional progress.

Yet the targets under SDG 16 exemplify the UN's tendency toward perfunctory idealism detached from empirical realities. Ending all forms of violence everywhere by 2030? Eradicating corruption and bribery in all their manifestations? Developing effective, transparent institutions at all levels? These goals are so extravagantly utopian as to be farcical in their unbridled ambition. They fail to reckon with the harsh realities of incentive structures, asymmetric power dynamics, and the sheer complexity of governance reform. Policymakers are given no practical guidance on how to priori prioritize and sequence interventions to maximize peace dividends. It's one thing to espouse high-minded ideals; it's quite another to craft technically sound policies that can credibly mitigate violence and instability worldwide in just 15 years.

Does anyone genuinely believe the Taliban's repressive Islamist tyranny will be vanquished by 2030? That kaleidoscopic criminal syndicates like MS-13 and the Yakuza will dismantle their empires out of altruism? That Afghanistan, Somalia and Yemen will spontaneously generate robust, transparent institutions after decades of chaos? Of course not. This entire goal reeks of a stunning naivete completely divorced from the nuances of diplomacy, geopolitics and statebuilding. It betrays the UN's chronic struggle to grapple with nonlinear challenges that do not yield to simplistic, one-size-fits-all remedies. The entrenched drivers of conflict and institutional failure are multifaceted, varying wildly across contexts and causalities. Blanket solutions often prove worse than ineffectual.

A more judicious policy agenda would organize targets and interventions according to a robust evidence-based framework centered on levels of fragility and prioritizing urgent need. Some countries like Switzerland simply require marginal improvements in transparency and access to justice. Others like Iraq are existentially afflicted by cascading violence and infrastructure decimation requiring focused security and governance assistance. A triage system of fragility clusters could better allocate resources to maximize harm reduction and stabilization impact. For severely blighted states, development policy may need to triage essential services and institutions rather than shooting for the moon with lofty whole-of-government reforms.

Where SDG 16 does merit qualified praise is its recognition that sustainable development is impeded in the absence of peaceful, just societies with trustworthy institutions. The goal rightly enshrines this critical principle. But its unwavering utopianism in the face of stubborn complexities ultimately undermines its functional relevance and credibility. Lofty ideals must be weighed against viability. As with any intervention, policymakers must rigorously identify contextual constraints and apply potent but pragmatic solutions. SDG 16 epitomizes the pitfalls of prioritizing inspirational rhetoric over evidence-based realpolitik. In failing to grapple with the granular mechanics of neutralizing violence and fortifying institutions worldwide, it risks being an empty vessel devoid of constructive value. For a world cleaved by entrenched instability and institutional rot, that's an immense missed opportunity.
