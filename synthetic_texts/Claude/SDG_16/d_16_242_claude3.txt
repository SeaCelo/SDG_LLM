Promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, providing access to justice for all, and building effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels – Goal 16 of the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – is a complex and multifaceted challenge that demands rigorous empirical analysis. As an economist and econometrician, I approach this goal through the lens of causal inference, seeking to disentangle the intricate web of factors that contribute to or impede progress on this front.

At the heart of Goal 16 lies the notion of good governance, which encompasses a wide range of institutional and societal elements, from the rule of law and control of corruption to the promotion of fundamental freedoms and participatory decision-making processes. While the importance of good governance for economic development and societal well-being has long been recognized, establishing causal relationships and identifying effective policy interventions has proven to be a formidable challenge.

One of the key obstacles in this domain is the endogeneity of governance indicators, as they are often inextricably linked to a myriad of other factors, such as economic development, education levels, and cultural norms. Disentangling these complex relationships requires innovative identification strategies and the leveraging of exogenous sources of variation, such as natural experiments or instrumental variables.

For instance, in a seminal study on the economic consequences of corruption, my colleagues and I exploited the variation in institutional quality across countries due to their colonial origins as a source of exogenous variation. By instrumenting for contemporary corruption levels using historical settler mortality rates, we were able to establish a causal link between corruption and long-run economic performance. This approach, while not without its limitations, exemplifies the importance of rigorous empirical methods in uncovering the causal mechanisms underlying the SDGs.

Another crucial aspect of Goal 16 is the promotion of inclusive societies and the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms. Here, too, the application of modern econometric techniques can shed light on the complex interplay between institutional quality, social cohesion, and economic outcomes. For example, researchers have employed regression discontinuity designs to assess the impact of electoral outcomes on the provision of public goods and the distribution of resources across different ethnic or socioeconomic groups.

Moreover, the growing availability of high-quality micro-level data, such as survey data and administrative records, has opened new avenues for investigating the determinants and consequences of institutional quality at the local level. By leveraging these rich data sources and employing cutting-edge econometric techniques, researchers can uncover granular insights into the mechanisms through which governance structures shape individual and community-level outcomes.

It is important to recognize, however, that the pursuit of Goal 16 extends beyond the realm of quantitative analysis. Qualitative and mixed-methods approaches are also essential for capturing the nuances of societal dynamics, cultural factors, and the lived experiences of marginalized and vulnerable populations. By combining rigorous econometric analyses with in-depth ethnographic studies and participatory research methods, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the challenges and opportunities associated with building inclusive, peaceful, and just societies.

Ultimately, the achievement of Goal 16 requires a multidisciplinary and collaborative effort, bringing together researchers, policymakers, civil society organizations, and local communities. As an economist and empirical researcher, my contribution lies in leveraging the power of causal inference and rigorous empirical methods to inform evidence-based policymaking and foster a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between institutions, governance, and sustainable development.
