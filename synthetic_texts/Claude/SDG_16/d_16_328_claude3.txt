The Italian Development Cooperation Programme, under the auspices of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has prioritized Sustainable Development Goal 16 (SDG 16) – Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions – as a cornerstone of its international development efforts. This strategic focus recognizes the fundamental role of good governance, the rule of law, and robust institutions in catalyzing sustainable development and fostering resilient societies.

Italy's approach to SDG 16 is multifaceted, reflecting the complexity of the goal's targets and the intricate interplay between peace, justice, and institutional strength. Central to our efforts is the promotion of inclusive, participatory, and representative decision-making processes at all levels. We actively support initiatives that enhance transparency, accountability, and access to information, empowering citizens to hold their governments accountable and participate meaningfully in the democratic process.

In conflict-affected regions, Italy is committed to supporting peacebuilding and conflict prevention efforts. Our programs prioritize strengthening national and local capacities for conflict resolution, mediation, and dialogue, recognizing that sustainable peace requires addressing the root causes of violence and fostering inclusive societies. We collaborate closely with local communities, civil society organizations, and international partners to promote reconciliation, social cohesion, and the protection of human rights.

The rule of law is a critical pillar of SDG 16, and Italy is actively engaged in supporting legal and judicial reforms in partner countries. Our initiatives aim to enhance access to justice, particularly for marginalized and vulnerable groups, by strengthening the independence, efficiency, and accountability of judicial systems. We provide technical assistance and capacity-building programs for legal professionals, law enforcement agencies, and criminal justice institutions, ensuring they operate in accordance with international human rights standards and best practices.

Combating corruption is a cross-cutting priority in our efforts to achieve SDG 16. Italy recognizes the detrimental impact of corruption on economic growth, service delivery, and public trust in institutions. Our programs focus on promoting transparency, enhancing anti-corruption measures, and strengthening the capacity of oversight bodies and civil society organizations to monitor and address corruption effectively.

Critically, Italy's approach to SDG 16 acknowledges the nexus between good governance, peace, and sustainable development. We support initiatives that foster effective, accountable, and transparent institutions at all levels, recognizing that robust institutions are essential for delivering public services, safeguarding human rights, and promoting economic growth. Our capacity-building programs target core government functions, such as public financial management, public administration reform, and decentralization processes, ensuring that institutions are equipped to respond to the needs of their citizens.

Furthermore, Italy recognizes the importance of data and evidence-based policymaking in achieving SDG 16. We support partner countries in strengthening their statistical capacities, enabling them to collect, analyze, and utilize data for informed decision-making and monitoring progress towards the goal's targets.

Throughout our efforts, Italy emphasizes the principles of national ownership, inclusive partnerships, and context-specific approaches. We engage with a diverse range of stakeholders, including government agencies, civil society organizations, the private sector, and local communities, to ensure that our interventions are tailored to the unique challenges and opportunities of each context. Additionally, we prioritize the meaningful participation of women, youth, and marginalized groups, recognizing their crucial role in building sustainable peace and resilient institutions.

By leveraging its expertise, resources, and partnerships, the Italian Development Cooperation Programme remains steadfast in its commitment to achieving SDG 16. We recognize that progress towards this goal is not only an end in itself but also a crucial enabler for the realization of the entire 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
