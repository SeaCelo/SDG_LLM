Here's a long academic article about SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) written in the satirical style of Dave Barry:

"Greetings, fellow humans! Today we're going to explore the wild, woolly world of SDG 16 - the one about peace, justice, and making sure our institutions don't devolve into a Snickers-fueled Lord of the Flies scenario.

Now, you might be thinking "Dave, why are we talking about this boring UN stuff when we could be discussing important topics like why doughnut boxes are always precisely two doughnuts too small?" Fair point, but stick with me because this SDG has the potential for pure comedy gold.

Let's start with the peace part. The UN wants to "significantly reduce all forms of violence and related death rates everywhere." Everywhere? Even in your typical Hollywood action movie where people get blown up more frequently than Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade balloons? I'm picturing Jack Bauer trying to negotiate a peace treaty with the bad guys: "Look, Sergei, we've had some differences over this nuclear warhead situation, but can't we settle this dispute through an exchange of backrubs and stress balls?"

But hey, I'm on board with reducing violence in real life. Although I do have questions about Section 16.1, which aims to "significantly reduce all forms of violence including torture of children." Does this mean we have to take away all those cool G.I. Joe action figures with the "Agonizing Twist" accessories? That seems a bit extreme.

Moving on to justice, the UN wants to "promote the rule of law at national and international levels." This sounds dangerously close to supporting those Ivy League referees who call technical fouls during your kid's U8 soccer game because little Timmy wasn't properly maintaining possession during his disgusting open-mouth sneeze on the ball. Maybe we could have the World Court arbitrate whether or not that was truly a foul.

As for strong institutions, the UN hopes to build "effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels." In other words, they want governments to be more like the cable company's customer service department: bogged down by endless loops of phone trees, indecipherable written policies, and employees who couldn't care less about your inconvenient impatience. Fun times!

But my favorite part has to be the UN's plan for "responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels." That sounds an awful lot like your typical middle school student council, where even voting on what color the dance decorations should be leads to tear-stained betrayals, ended friendships, and at least one counselor quitting to pursue a paper route career.

Look, I'm all for world peace, but maybe we should start small. Like getting my neighbors to stop throwing egg salad sandwich innards onto my driveway every Tuesday at 3am. If we can accomplish that modest goal, perhaps the UN can move on to bigger issues. Until then, I'm stocking up on Nerf and doughnut delivery services. You know, the essentials."
