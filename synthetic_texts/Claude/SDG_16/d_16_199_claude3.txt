Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions), written from the perspective of the late economist Walter E. Williams:

Over the course of my career as an economist and academic, I have seen many well-intentioned policies and initiatives aimed at fostering progress and improving people's lives. However, more often than not, these top-down efforts fail to appreciate the true drivers of societal advancement: individual liberty and respect for private property rights. The 16th Sustainable Development Goal exemplifies this misguided approach.

At its core, SDG 16 seeks to "promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels." A noble ambition, to be sure. But as is so often the case, the devil lies in the details – and the implicit suppositions underlying this goal are highly problematic.  

The very notion that "sustainable development" can be centrally planned and implemented through institutional reforms is reminiscent of the failed central planning of the 20th century's socialist and communist regimes. Free people engaging in voluntary exchange in free markets have proven time and again to be the greatest catalyst for economic development and societal progress.

Institutions certainly do matter, but the most important ones are those which safeguard personal and economic freedoms. The rule of law, property rights, and constraints on government power have been the bedrock of the most prosperous and peaceful nations in history. In contrast, international development bureaucracies staffed by elite intellectuals have a dismal track record of delivering on their well-intentioned promises.

Let's examine SDG 16's specific targets more closely. Reducing violence, exploitation, organized crime, and corruption are all laudable goals in theory. But their root causes are inevitably linked to ill-conceived government policies that create lucrative black markets and perverse incentives. The war on drugs is a prime example of how prohibition enriches violent criminal enterprises.

True justice is founded upon objectivity, equality before the law, and due process – not equity based on group identification. And inclusive institutions are meaningless if they lack democratic accountability and protections for individual rights, including property rights. New York's disastrous affordable housing policies illustrate how even well-intentioned schemes can lead to disastrous unintended consequences.

If the global community is genuinely concerned about building more peaceful, inclusive societies with accountable governance, it should look to the ideas of classical liberal thinkers like John Locke, Adam Smith, and Frederick Bastiat. Their insights regarding natural rights, free markets, and constraints on state power have catalyzed development and enriched humanity far more than any UN agenda.

At the end of the day, no expert panel or technocratic policy can instill the cultural values, social norms, and institutional incentives needed for human flourishing as effectively as freedom and voluntary cooperation. The greatest feat of "sustainable development" has been the modern revival of economic liberalism, as imperfect as its application has been.

Those are the hard truths that need to be acknowledged. The antiquated vision of enlightened elites guiding societal progress through international institutions and wealth redistribution has repeatedly failed. It's time to look to alternatives anchored in individual sovereignty, free markets, and strictly limited government – the true wellsprings of human progress.
