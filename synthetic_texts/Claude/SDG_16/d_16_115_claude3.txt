Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions), written from the perspective of Terence Blacker:

The Illusion of Progress: SDG 16 and the Systemic Erosion of Justice 
By Terence Blacker

At the heart of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 16 lies a paradox so stark that it calls into question the very premise upon which the entire SDG framework is built. The goal's lofty ambitions - to "promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels" - are laudable in their idealism. Yet they exist in a world increasingly defined by the forces diametrically opposed to such noble aspirations.

We find ourselves in an age of unraveling, where the foundational pillars of democracy and human rights are being systematically dismantled. A great backsliding is underway, as authoritarian regimes tighten their grip and even long-established democracies fall prey to the insidious forces of nationalism, populism, and anti-institutional fervor. The rule of law, that hallowed construct meant to ensure equality before an impartial justice system, is being contorted to serve the interests of the powerful and well-connected.

In this climate of democratic recession, the notion of "effective, accountable and inclusive institutions" has become a cruel fiction. From the halls of legislative bodies to the marbled corridors of judicial systems, impunity reigns supreme. The rich and influential operate with near-total immunity, flouting laws and norms with casual disregard, while the dispossessed and disenfranchised are subject to the full force of a system stacked against them.

The statistics are as damning as they are unsurprising. In 2022, the World Justice Project's Rule of Law Index found that over a quarter of the world's population lives in countries where civil justice systems are no more than "facade built atop a hollow core." This is no mere academic concern; it represents a tangible threat to the lives and livelihoods of billions. When justice is a commodity to be bought and sold, the path to sustainable development is obstructed at every turn.

Nor is this malaise confined to the developing world. The erosion of judicial independence and the politicization of legal systems have become alarmingly prevalent in Western nations once seen as bulwarks of democratic principles. The United States, that self-proclaimed "shining city on a hill," has seen its courts increasingly polarized along ideological lines, undermining public faith in their impartiality. In the United Kingdom, the very concept of an independent judiciary has come under direct assault from a populist government hellbent on consolidating its own power.

In this bleak landscape, SDG 16's call for "access to justice for all" rings increasingly hollow. Justice, it would seem, is a privilege reserved for the few, while the vast majority are left to navigate a labyrinth of institutional bias, procedural barriers, and systemic discrimination. The most marginalized – the poor, the disenfranchised, the persecuted minorities – bear the brunt of this injustice, their voices silenced and their rights trampled upon.

And yet, the architects of the SDGs would have us believe that real progress is being made. They point to modest statistical improvements in certain metrics, cherry-picking data points that obscure the larger truth: that the very foundations upon which the rule of law is meant to stand are being steadily eroded. It is a cruel sleight of hand, akin to lauding the fresh coat of paint on a house as it crumbles into ruin.

Perhaps most insidious of all is the way in which the language of the SDGs itself has been co-opted and subverted. Authoritarian regimes have proven adept at paying lip service to the ideals of "inclusive institutions" and "access to justice," even as they systematically dismantle those very principles in practice. It is a perverse form of greenwashing, where the rhetoric of sustainability and human rights is wielded as a smokescreen to obscure the inexorable march of oppression.

In this paradoxical world, where the forces of regression masquerade as agents of progress, we must confront an uncomfortable truth: the Sustainable Development Goals, at least in their current form, are ill-equipped to address the systemic challenges that threaten to unravel the very fabric of justice and human rights. Without a fundamental reckoning with the forces that have brought us to this precipice, SDG 16 risks becoming little more than a hollow slogan, a failed promise to billions consigned to lives of institutionalized injustice.

The way forward, if there is one, lies not in incremental tinkering or the celebration of marginal statistical gains. It demands a radical reimagining of the systems and structures that have proven so susceptible to corruption and subversion. It requires a comprehensive assault on the insidious ideologies that have eroded our collective commitment to the rule of law and human rights.

Above all, it necessitates a reckoning with the harsh reality that progress is not a linear path, but a constant struggle against the ever-present forces of regression. The architects of the SDGs would do well to heed the lessons of history, which teach us that the march of civilization is neither inevitable nor irreversible. Justice, peace, and strong institutions are not end states to be achieved, but ideals to be fiercely defended – battlegrounds upon which the forces of enlightenment and reaction wage an eternal struggle.

In this context, SDG 16 stands not as a blueprint for sustainable development, but as a stark reminder of the fragility of the principles it enshrines. It is a call to uncompromising vigilance, a demand that we confront the harsh truths of our age with unflinching clarity. For only in doing so can we hope to forge a path towards a more just and equitable world – a world in which the ideals of the SDGs are not mere rhetorical flourishes, but living, breathing realities for all of humanity.
