Here is a long academic article about SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) as if written by Maureen Dowd:

Lasting Peace Remains an Elusive Quarry 

Let's get real. Despite the idealistic United Nations blathering about peace, justice and strong institutions, the state of the world is a hot mess. Conflict, injustice and failed states are a sobering reality from the Middle East to Central America to parts of Asia and Africa. 

The Arab Spring raised hopes of more democratic and stable governance across a swath of the Muslim world. Instead, it's largely devolved into deadly turmoil in Syria, Libya, Yemen and pockets of upheaval elsewhere. Democracy is as distant a dream as ever in places like Sisi's brutally repressive Egypt. 

Rather than moving the freedom agenda forward, the heady days of the Arab Spring have given way to a forest of a dishearteningly familiar phenomena: tyrannical regimes, sectarian warfare, refugee crises, human rights atrocities and bloody clashes between modernity and fundamentalism.

At the same time, venally self-interested leaders from Putin to Erdogan to Orban pose an increasing threat to democratic norms, human rights and the rule of law in established nations. Alarming numbers of people across the democratic world are also losing faith in democratic institutions and principles, fueling a countervailing tide of nativism, xenophobia and even authoritarianism.  

Against this dystopian backdrop, the UN's pious paeans to "rule of law" and "accountable and transparent institutions" ring increasingly hollow. By their own metrics, progress toward SDG 16 is dispiritingly sluggish or even regressing in many parts of the world.

The human heartbreak tells the real story. Genocide persists, with brutal mass killings of Rohingya in Myanmar and Yazidis by ISIS. Over 68 million people – a record high – have fled their homes as refugees or internally displaced people, including a staggering number of children impacted by armed conflict. Even the most excruciating manifestation of civilizational failure – modern slavery – has shockingly metastasized, with over 40 million people estimated to be trapped in forced labor and sexual exploitation.  

Meanwhile, the UN's own humanitarian workers, peacekeepers and aid workers frequently find themselves in the crosshairs. Despite UN guarantees of protecting civilians, UN peacekeepers have perpetrated a sordid litany of sex abuse scandals and unconscionable acts like allowing massacres to unfold unimpeded.

It's not just unstable or war-torn regions where injustice and dysfunction reign. Even prosperous democracies are wrestling with a crisis of public confidence in government, courts and other institutions. A culture of impunity often prevails, allowing those with wealth and power to escape accountability.

The United States itself faces a reckoning as the world's beacon of democracy has dimmed. Trust in democratic institutions like Congress and the electoral process has plummeted. A malignant tide of hyper-partisanship, disinformation, voter suppression efforts and anti-democratic forces all raise deeply troubling questions about the nation's commitment to justice and governance for all. 

It's that sobering meta-backdrop that casts the UN's lofty SDG 16 aspirations in a harsh light. But to be fair, the architects never promised quick fixes or easy answers. Institution building, battling corruption, upholding human rights, ensuring accountability, reinforcing the rule of law, establishing access to justice – these are multi-generational struggles, not a checklist of expedient policy tweaks.

At a deeper level, SDG 16 amounts to an aspirational blueprint for sustainable human development in its most holistic sense. It's about nurturing the essential societal ingredients for human flourishing – freedom, security, good governance and equitable justice under the rule of law. 

These foundations are vital preconditions for achieving the other SDGs, from eradicating poverty to mitigating climate crises to guaranteeing quality healthcare and education. Sustainable progress across the spectrum of human advancement requires a bedrock of just, peaceful and robust societal infrastructure.

So we remain squarely in the trenches of that arduous work, without the luxury of resting on metaphorical laurels. The road ahead toward realizing the aspirations of SDG 16 remain daunting and strewn with obstacles. Yet the alternative – resigning the world to conflict, oppression and injustice – is an unacceptable surrender.

The only path forward is doubling down on the gritty work of fortifying inclusive, accountable governance and human rights norms while battling corruption, lawlessness and institutionalized discrimination. It's the hard-won project of generations, fraught with setbacks and facing fierce reactionary counter-forces.

No global kumbaya moment looms. For now, lasting peace, justice and strong institutions remain more elusive quarry than established achievement. But that which is worth achieving rarely arrives cheaply or easily. The audacious yet vital pursuit continues, one hard-fought stride at a time.
