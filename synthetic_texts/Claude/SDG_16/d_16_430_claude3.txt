Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) recognizes that the attainment of Sustainable Development Goal 16 – Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions – is intrinsically linked to our capacity to deliver humanitarian aid effectively and sustainably. Our operations span conflict zones, fragile states, and regions afflicted by chronic violence, where the absence of robust governance structures, the rule of law, and accountability mechanisms hinders our ability to provide essential medical care to vulnerable populations.

In the Central African Republic, a country ravaged by prolonged civil unrest, MSF teams have borne witness to the devastating consequences of institutional fragility. The collapse of the judicial system has fostered an environment of impunity, enabling armed groups to commit atrocities with impunity, including targeted attacks on healthcare facilities and personnel. Consequently, access to vital medical services has been severely compromised, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis and perpetuating cycles of violence and displacement.

Similarly, in Yemen, where a complex web of regional and international actors fuels an intractable conflict, the erosion of state authority and the breakdown of rule of law have created a vacuum that has been exploited by non-state armed groups. These groups have engaged in systematic human rights violations, including indiscriminate attacks on civilian populations and the deliberate targeting of medical infrastructure. MSF has been forced to suspend operations in several areas due to the unacceptable risks posed to our staff and beneficiaries.

Conversely, in regions where relatively strong governance structures and institutional frameworks exist, MSF has been better positioned to deliver aid effectively. In Jordan, for instance, the government's commitment to upholding the rule of law and protecting the rights of refugees has facilitated our efforts to provide comprehensive medical care to Syrian refugees and vulnerable host communities.

Undoubtedly, the achievement of SDG 16 is a multifaceted challenge, requiring concerted efforts from various stakeholders, including national governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector. However, from MSF's perspective, several key priorities emerge:

1. Strengthening the capacity of national institutions to uphold the rule of law, combat corruption, and ensure accountability for human rights violations and abuses. This includes bolstering judicial systems, promoting transparency and good governance, and fostering an enabling environment for civil society and independent media to thrive.

2. Enhancing the protection of civilians in armed conflicts, with a particular emphasis on safeguarding healthcare facilities, personnel, and patients. This necessitates robust enforcement mechanisms for international humanitarian law and the development of context-specific strategies to mitigate the risks posed by non-state armed groups.

3. Addressing the root causes of conflict and violence, such as socioeconomic inequalities, resource scarcity, and political marginalization. This requires a holistic approach that integrates peacebuilding, conflict resolution, and sustainable development efforts, while fostering inclusive and participatory decision-making processes.

4. Promoting access to justice and effective remedy for victims of human rights violations, including through the establishment of transitional justice mechanisms and reparation programs.

5. Strengthening global partnerships and multilateral cooperation to combat transnational threats, such as organized crime, human trafficking, and terrorism, which undermine the foundations of peace, justice, and strong institutions.

Ultimately, MSF's ability to fulfill its humanitarian mandate hinges on the realization of SDG 16. As we strive to alleviate suffering and provide life-saving medical care in some of the world's most challenging environments, we remain steadfast in our commitment to advocating for the establishment of effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions that uphold the rule of law and protect the fundamental rights and dignity of all individuals.
