Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions), written from the perspective of political cartoonist and commentator Ted Rall:

The Unbearable Lightness of SDG 16: A Realist's Take on Peace, Justice and Governance

As a cynical satirist who has spent decades lampooning the myopic institutions and corrupt power structures that rig the system, I can't help but scoff at the starry-eyed naivete of the UN's 16th Sustainable Development Goal. Peace, justice and strong institutions? That's about as likely as Donald Trump being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

Let's start with the Call to Action section's first target: "Significantly reduce all forms of violence and related death rates everywhere." Are they serious? Even as the UN was patting itself on the back for this lofty aspiration, terrorist groups like ISIS were broadcasting high-definition snuff videos of captured civilians being burned alive or beheaded with reptilian glee. From the slaughterhouses of Syria to the ethnic cleansing campaigns in Myanmar, violence has become humanity's most boundless and renewable resource.

Then there's the pursuit of justice for all. Sure, why not? We'll get right on that after we've solved other quixotic quests like achieving world peace and putting an end to famine, poverty and disease. I'll believe in justice when I see Wall Street CEOs doing perp walks instead of getting billions in bailouts funded by the very taxpayers they fleeced.

As for strong institutions and accountable governance? That's simply adorable. Maybe someone should pass that memo to the gerrymandering voter suppression squads of the Republican Party. Or to the corporate lobbyists who have a bigger say in legislation than the actual constituents our elected officials are supposed to represent.

Don't get me wrong, I'm all for peace, justice and strong institutions in theory. But the sad reality is that humanity's unbridled capacity for greed, tribalism and moral bankruptcy will never allow for their widespread implementation. The rich and powerful always rig the rules to preserve their own dominance. The poor and powerless get repression, exploitation and a relentless cycle of violence as their birthright.

If we were serious about SDG 16, we'd start by dismantling the United Nations itself - an utterly feckless bureaucracy that has devolved into a impotent talking shop for dictators who flagrantly ignore its principals. We'd abolish the military-industrial complexes that have made warfare so profitably self-perpetuating. And we'd end the institutional oppression of the unjust economic systems that create the very poverty and injustice that breed violence in the first place.

But that's not going to happen anytime soon, not when those benefiting most from the status quo have such an incredibly strong grip on the global order. As an anti-establishment dissenter, I'd love to be proven wrong. But that's about as probable as the current regime of self-serving plutocrats spontaneously deciding to make the world a more peaceful, just and ethical place. Don't hold your breath.

When it comes to SDG 16, the UN is arguably guilty of institutionalizing false hope - offering an illusion of positive change to aneesthize the masses while protecting the unjust power structures that rule the world. But hey, at least we have these SDGs to virtue signal with, right? Let's just paste them on a re-usable tote bag and call it a day.
