Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions), written from the perspective of conservative Australian political commentator Piers Akerman:

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 16 calls for promoting "peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, providing access to justice for all and building effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels." On the surface, these objectives seem innocuous enough. Who could be against peace, justice, and good governance? However, a deeper examination reveals this agenda item to be a Trojan horse for a radical leftist ideology that threatens Western civilization as we know it.

The proponents of SDG 16 couch their aims in lofty rhetoric about human rights, the rule of law, and ending corruption. But make no mistake - their true intent is to undermine national sovereignty and impose an ultra-progressive world order ruled by unelected bureaucrats and activist judges. The vision of "inclusive societies" is code for open borders, allowing unrestricted flows of migrants to overwhelm our cities and suburbs. The call for "effective institutions" translates to empowering globalist organizations like the UN to override and dictate policies to democratically-elected governments.  

We've already seen this play out with mechanisms like the UN Human Rights Council, dominated by repressive regimes yet arrogantly sitting in judgment of liberal democracies. Australia rightly withdrew from this partisan kangaroo court in 2018. Now the UN wants a Sovereign Integrity Unit to "monitor" and enforce its draconian Sustainable Development edicts on member states. This is the very definition of a threat to our national autonomy and institutional integrity.

The rule of law is sacrosanct, but too often it is being perverted by judicial overreach from activist judges reading their own policy preferences into legal interpretations. Just look at how our robust youth defense laws were undermined by unilateral amendments imposed by unelected judges on the pretext of dubious "human rights" considerations. Our robust common law traditions are the real bulwark of justice, not UN bureaucratic scheming.

As for ending corruption, we need look no further than the allegations swirling around the sketchy finances and leadership of the United Nations itself. How can an organization mired in graft and opacity presume to lecture sovereign nations on institutional accountability and transparency? It's the height of hypocrisy.

In essence, SDG 16 is a subversive attempt to smuggle in radical constitutional reformism through the back door under the guise of utterly unexceptional platitudes about justice and governance. The liberal elites know that overt assaults on the liberal democratic order would be roundly rejected, so they resort to deceptive, Gramscian "marching through the institutions" to gradually erode public trust and Nation state legitimacy. 

We cannot let this Marxist wolves parade around in sheep's clothing. While ending conflict, upholding justice, and maintaining institutional integrity are objectively desirable, we must remain vigilant that these principles are not perverted into vehicles for a totalitarian globalist agenda. Enshrining our Westminster constitutional traditions through strict adherence to the central tenets of democracy, freedom of speech, and observance of due process before the law is the only sustainable path to peace and good governance.

The road to governance hell is paved with bien pensant intentions like those espoused in SDG 16. Let us have the wisdom to call out this United Sanctions power grab for the treacherous subterfuge that it is. Our peaceful way of life depends on it.
