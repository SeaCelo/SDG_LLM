Here is a detailed academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions), written from the perspective of Brendan O'Neill, a polemicist known for his contrarian and provocative views:

The UN's Sustainable Development Goal 16 - the promotion of "peaceful and inclusive societies" - seems well-intentioned. Who could object to peace and justice? But beneath the lofty rhetoric lies an insidious agenda to dilute national sovereignty and erode hard-won civil liberties in the name of global governance and utopian social engineering.

The obsession with "strong institutions" is a Trojan horse for the further empowerment of unaccountable, oligarchic supranational bodies over nation-states and their democratically elected governments. The SDGs' architects envision a world order where national policymaking withers under the diktat of bureaucrats in global institutions like the UN. This sidelines voters and neuters democracy itself.

We're told SDG 16 will help sustain "just, peaceful and inclusive societies." But who decides what constitutes justice, peace and inclusivity? Unelected, Eurocratic busybodies? The SDGs use positive language as camouflage for an illiberal vision that undermines freedom of speech, freedom of association, due process and other core civil liberties.

For instance, SDG 16 calls for reducing "corruption and bribery in all their forms." An admirable goal until you realize the UN views free speech as a form of "corruption" that must be restricted to protect the governing class from criticism or dissent. Access to information is viewed as a threat to social stability.

Indeed, the SDGs are haunted by the UN's sordid history of backing authoritarian regimes and dictators so long as they paid lip service to its utopian collectivist ethos. From the USSR to contemporary China, the UN has turned a blind eye to human rights abuses and crackdowns on freedom - the very abuses SDG 16 claims to remedy.  

At its core, SDG 16 is an expression of the elite ideology of globalism - the idea that global problems require global, "internationally coordinated" solutions cooked up by a cosseted clerisy exempt from the democratic demands of the people they govern. It is a recipe for erasing borders, dissolving nations, and replacing vibrant diversity with a grey, soul-sapping homogeneity.

The implicit assumption is that humanity can achieve perfection through adherence to top-down social re-engineering as dictated by the UN and its array ofself-appointed, self-sustaining NGOs. This is deluded and dangerous thinking. We are humans, not robots awaiting "sustainable development" upgrades administered by Planet Earth's self-styled software developers.

SDG 16's invocation of "strong institutions" hints at an unmistakable authoritarian impulse. After all, what institution is stronger than the police state and its apparatus of surveillance, censorship, and coercion cloaked in "the rule of law"? Peace and justice already exist where people's rights are protected from overweening state power. But the UN sees things differently.

The SDGs reflect an outmoded, cynical view of mankind as flawed, ignorant masses incapable of self-government without management and nudging from our caring, ethical betters. This is why global bureaucracies are relentlessly aggrandizing powers once reserved for sovereign states and their citizens. The utopians dream that the world can at last be organized according to "reason" and the principles of sustainable development dogma.

But societies develop most sustainably when the people are free - to think, speak, work, and pursue their own conceptions of the good life without petty legal sanction. Not when they are micromanaged by apparatchik overlords pursuing the latest social experiment issued by Ivory Tower diktats.
