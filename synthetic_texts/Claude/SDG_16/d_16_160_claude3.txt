Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions), written from the perspective of conservative commentator Jonah Goldberg:

The Sustainable Development Goals are a noble effort by the United Nations to establish a "shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet." But when it comes to SDG 16 - Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions - there are some glaring contradictions and blind spots that should concern any classical liberal or conservative.

The overarching goal of "promoting peaceful and inclusive societies" sounds wonderful in theory. Who could be against peace, justice and strong institutions to uphold the rule of law? The problem is in the details, where a progressive, bureaucratic and ultimately illiberal agenda is evident.

Take for example the target to "significantly reduce all forms of violence and related death rates everywhere." An admirable goal to be sure. But the international bodies pushing this ask us to take it as an article of faith that more government intervention, more programs, and more public spending will magically reduce violence. The manifest failures of the War on Poverty, the War on Drugs, and foreign nation-building efforts are conveniently ignored.

There's an implicit assumption that the primary threat to peace comes from non-state actors, when some of the most horrific violence has been perpetrated by governments themselves - communist regimes killed over 100 million of their own citizens in the 20th century. Shouldn't the focus be on strengthening constitutional limits on state power and holding governments accountable for human rights abuses?

The goals for increasing access to justice and building "effective, accountable and inclusive institutions" sound nice, but would concentrate more power in the hands of unaccountable bureaucracies and transnational organizations. There's little appreciation for the diffuse accountability of markets, freedom of association, or the importance of civil society countervailing the power of the state.

SDG 16 calls for "responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels." But what does that mean exactly? It sounds perilously close to the anti-democratic radical participatory politics that has crippled governance in many developing countries. Representative democracy, checks and balances, and defending minority rights are safer pathways, as the Founders understood.

It's also increasingly clear that the UN's vision of rooting out "corruption and bribery in all their forms" exempts internal corruption scandals, the bribes paid by despots to attain membership on the Human Rights Council, or lucrative no-bid contracts handed out to UN-accredited NGOs and preferred donors like China. The double standards are glaring.

There's an entire section on providing "legal identity for all, including birth registration." Constitutional republics are wisely circumspect about allowing the national government unfettered power to determine the bounds of citizenship and legal identity. What if an authoritarian regime uses that power to strip away rights from disfavored minorities?

The overall thrust of SDG 16 seems to be pushing a form of top-down transnational progressivism that prioritizes short-term humanitarian goals over core Enlightenment values of individual liberty, economic freedom, and democratic accountability. 

There's a Panglossian faith that expanding the power of administrators, credentialed experts and bureaucracies will organically birth "peaceful and inclusive societies." But liberty is the true engine of peace and flourishing - creating space for human creativity, ingenuity and spontaneous order to emerge. Ironically, SDG 16 could pose a threat to the liberal democratic foundations that make peace, justice and strong institutions possible.
