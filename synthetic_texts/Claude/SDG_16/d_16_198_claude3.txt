Here is a detailed academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions), written from the perspective of conservative political commentator George Will:

The Pursuit of Just and Peaceful Societies: Unbridled Idealism or Virtuous Pragmatism?

The 16th Sustainable Development Goal, with its lofty aims of promoting peaceful, inclusive societies, access to justice, and effective institutions, presents an intriguing paradox. On one hand, it exemplifies the admirable albeit quixotic aspirations that so often characterize liberal internationalist agendas - grandiose designs to fundamentally reshape humanity through bureaucratic fiats. Yet, stripped of its utopian veneer, Goal 16 also gestures towards certain eternal truths about humankind's innate yearning for order, equity and freedom from oppression that should resonate with even the most hardened conservative realists.

The intellectually-promiscuous would do well to resist the facile polarities that so often cloud judicious analysis of such weighty matters. Rather than the usual ritualistic tongue-lashings traded between the high-minded progressives and the pragmatic nationalists, we would be better served by a dispassionate assessment of both the ideals underpinning Goal 16, as well as the policies proposed to operationalize them.  

Few would contend that the core imperatives of just, peaceful and inclusive societies governed by legitimate and capable institutions are undesirable ends. What rational actor would willfully opt for anarchic oppression, institutional ineptitude or social unrest? The scorched annals of human civilization provide ample evidence that such conditions are ruinous to any nation's long-term prospects for stability and prosperity.

Where legitimate concerns arise, however, is in the specific policy prescriptions advanced under the UN's banner to achieve these laudable goals. One need not be an anti-globalist troglodyte to question whether the UN's historically dubious governance record renders it fit to lecture sovereign nation-states on cultivating capable institutions. This, after all, is the same institution whose own ineptitude was laid bare by the ruinous oil-for-food scandal and perpetual scandals of sexual abuse by peacekeepers.  

Similarly, can we reasonably expect governments to defer to international technocratic diktats on contentious issues like governance, human rights and rule of law when these very precepts are so inextricably shaped by individual national contexts, cultures and traditions? America's conception of democracy and jurisprudence, for example, is a distinct byproduct of its Anglo-Protestant heritage - a tradition quite alien to many other nation-states. To blindly advocate "one-size-fits-all" reform agendas is to court unintended consequences.

None of this, however, should be misconstrued as an outright repudiation of Goal 16's fundamental ideals or the notion of international cooperation to promote peace and effective governance. The unalloyed truth is that in our intrinsically disordered world, the cause of cultivating stable societies regulated by legitimate authority remains a perpetual and utterly vital pursuit for any civilized peoples.

Perhaps the most sagacious approach, therefore, is to soberly embrace Goal 16's laudable principles as overarching ethical lodestar, while allowing nation-states broad latitude to navigate their own paths towards those ideals in accords with their unique customs and contexts. For just as Aristotelian philosophy cautions against the distortions of excessive abstraction, so too should we heed the perils of utopian universalisms divorced from the realpolitik and frictional contingencies of the human condition.

While eternal vigilance must be paid to forestalling descents into chauvinist excesses and arbitrary despotisms, the animating spirit of Goal 16 is ultimately one that any thinking conservative should celebrate - the ceaseless societal endeavor to continuously refine humankind's imperfect strivings towards just, ethical, and well-governed orders amidst the permanent metastases of fragility and darkness. It is an intrinsically conservative pursuit.
