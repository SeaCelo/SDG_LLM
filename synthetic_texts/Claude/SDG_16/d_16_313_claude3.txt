As a signatory to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Canada is committed to promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, providing access to justice for all, and building effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels â€“ the central tenets of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16. The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) recognizes the intrinsic linkages between peace, justice, and inclusive governance, and their pivotal role in catalyzing progress across the entire 2030 Agenda.

CIDA's strategy for advancing SDG 16 is anchored in a multi-pronged approach that encompasses programmatic interventions, policy advocacy, and strategic partnerships. Our programming prioritizes the promotion of human rights, the rule of law, and access to justice, with a particular emphasis on marginalized and vulnerable groups, including women, children, indigenous peoples, and persons with disabilities.

In fragile and conflict-affected contexts, CIDA has been at the forefront of supporting inclusive peace processes, facilitating dialogue among stakeholders, and promoting reconciliation efforts. Our initiatives have focused on strengthening the capacities of local and national institutions, enhancing community-based conflict resolution mechanisms, and fostering grassroots peacebuilding initiatives. Additionally, we have actively supported disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration programs, as well as security sector reforms, to enhance accountability and civilian oversight.

Recognizing the inextricable link between corruption and underdevelopment, CIDA has deployed a multi-faceted anti-corruption strategy. This includes support for robust legal and institutional frameworks, capacity building for oversight bodies and law enforcement agencies, and the promotion of transparency and accountability measures. We have also championed the adoption of open data policies, e-governance initiatives, and the empowerment of civil society organizations to serve as watchdogs.

CIDA's efforts to advance SDG 16 extend beyond traditional development programming. We have actively engaged in policy dialogues and advocacy efforts at global, regional, and national levels to promote the rule of law, access to justice, and effective governance. Our agency has been a vocal proponent of legal empowerment initiatives, aimed at enhancing the knowledge and capacities of marginalized communities to claim their rights and access legal services.

Furthermore, CIDA has forged strategic partnerships with a diverse array of stakeholders, including civil society organizations, academic institutions, and the private sector. These collaborations have enabled us to leverage expertise, resources, and innovative approaches to address complex challenges related to SDG 16. For instance, our partnership with the Canadian Forum on Public Governance has facilitated the exchange of best practices and the development of tailored capacity-building programs for public sector institutions in partner countries.

As we approach the mid-point of the 2030 Agenda, CIDA remains steadfast in its commitment to promoting peaceful, just, and inclusive societies. We recognize that progress on SDG 16 is not only an end in itself but also a critical enabler for achieving the entire sustainable development agenda. Our holistic approach, which combines programmatic interventions, policy advocacy, and strategic partnerships, is designed to catalyze transformative change and build resilient institutions capable of withstanding shocks and stresses.

Looking ahead, CIDA will continue to adapt its strategies and programming to address emerging challenges and leverage innovative solutions. We will prioritize the integration of technology and digital tools to enhance access to justice, promote transparency, and strengthen accountability mechanisms. Additionally, we will intensify our efforts to engage youth and harness their potential as agents of change, recognizing their pivotal role in shaping the future of governance and peacebuilding.
