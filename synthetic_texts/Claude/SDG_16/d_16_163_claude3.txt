Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions), written from the perspective of journalist and author Froma Harrop:

Lasting Peace Requires Inclusive Justice and Resilient Institutions

As a journalist bearing witness to global conflicts and their root causes, I've seen firsthand how elusive the lofty ideals of peace, justice, and capable governance can be. The 16th Sustainable Development Goal represents an ambitious blueprint for building the institutional foundations required for equitable, peaceful societies to take root and thrive. 

At its core, SDG 16 recognizes that positive peace—the absence of not just violence but the fear of violence—necessitates far more than temporary cessations of hostility. Meaningful peace demands that all segments of society enjoy access to impartial justice systems, are represented in decision-making processes, and can voice dissent through legitimate political channels. Where impunity, exclusion, and repression hold sway, resentments inevitably fester and erupt.

Too often, short-term transactional interests have taken priority over systemic reforms to judicial institutions and democratic norms. Deals are cut to buy off militant factions or co-opt regional power brokers, perpetuating cycles of conflict by leaving the underlying injustices unresolved. A tenuous quiet may settle, but in the absence of inclusive governance and legal accountability, it represents merely a lull before the next outbreak of violence.

Effective civilian oversight and robust legislative constraints on executive authority create transparency and prevent abuses. From Eastern Europe to Central America, I've chronicled how unchecked leadership corrodes checks and balances. When rulers can act with impunity—rigging elections, silencing critics, siphoning public funds—it breeds contempt for the rule of law and erodes social cohesion.  

No democracy can be healthy and self-sustaining without a vigorous civil society empowered to organize, advocate, and apply pressure from outside formal power structures. Too frequently, however, civic activists face intimidation, surveillance, and even lethal violence while authorities turn a blind eye.

Indigenous communities have endured historic marginalization at the hands of distant, unrepresentative governance structures. SDG 16 emphasizes the imperative of securing equal rights and meaningful autonomy for these populations—recognizing their traditional lands, promoting their political inclusion, and enabling indigenous self-determination.

Reducing all forms of violence and exploitation must go hand-in-hand with institutional reforms. For women and children, the home is too often the source of profound insecurity. SDG 16 underscores the need for legal protections and responsive law enforcement to create a truly peaceful society within households as well as between nation-states.

Robust financial management infrastructure, from transparent budgeting to anti-corruption safeguards, is pivotal for channeling public resources toward effective, accountable provision of services and public goods. In kleptocratic regimes and regions plagued by graft, promised security and development dividends routinely go undelivered.

Ultimately, SDG 16 speaks to the interdependence of peace, justice, and capable governance—both among and within countries. Sustainable development cannot take root amid instability and oppression. For peace to be lasting and prosperity to be inclusive, it demands universal human rights, equal access to impartial arbitration, representative decision-making, and resilient public institutions firmly grounded in the rule of law.
