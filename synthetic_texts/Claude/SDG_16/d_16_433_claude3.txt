Mercy Corps' analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 16 â€“ Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions:

The pursuit of sustainable development hinges on the establishment of peaceful, just, and inclusive societies underpinned by robust governance frameworks and effective institutions. SDG 16 serves as a catalyst for addressing deeply entrenched systemic challenges that have perpetuated cycles of conflict, insecurity, and human rights violations globally.

In regions grappling with protracted armed conflicts, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, and Yemen, the absence of strong institutions and the breakdown of the rule of law have exacerbated humanitarian crises. Civilian populations bear the brunt of these conflicts, enduring widespread displacement, sexual and gender-based violence, and the disruption of essential services. Mercy Corps' interventions in these contexts prioritize conflict mitigation, community-based protection mechanisms, and capacity-building for local authorities to uphold human rights and ensure access to justice.

Additionally, the scourge of corruption, which impedes sustainable development, remains a formidable obstacle. In countries like Ukraine, Guatemala, and Afghanistan, pervasive corruption has undermined public trust in institutions, hindered economic growth, and diverted resources from critical social services. Mercy Corps' approach emphasizes multi-stakeholder engagement, promoting transparency and accountability measures, and empowering civil society organizations to hold duty-bearers accountable.

The nexus between SDG 16 and other SDGs is undeniable. For instance, the lack of inclusive and participatory decision-making processes perpetuates marginalization and inequality, undermining progress toward SDGs 5 (Gender Equality) and 10 (Reduced Inequalities). Mercy Corps' programming in contexts like Iraq and Syria integrates inclusive governance initiatives, ensuring that diverse voices, particularly those of women and youth, are represented in shaping policies and development priorities.

Furthermore, the destabilizing impact of climate change, highlighted by SDG 13 (Climate Action), poses profound challenges to peace and security. In regions like the Sahel and the Horn of Africa, where climate-induced resource scarcity and environmental degradation exacerbate existing tensions, Mercy Corps adopts a conflict-sensitive approach, promoting sustainable natural resource management and livelihood diversification to mitigate the drivers of conflict.

Leveraging innovative technological solutions is also crucial to realizing SDG 16. Mercy Corps has pioneered the use of digital platforms and mobile applications to enhance access to justice, facilitate secure documentation of human rights violations, and promote transparent and accountable governance processes. For instance, in contexts like Syria and Myanmar, where access to formal justice systems is limited, Mercy Corps has deployed mobile legal aid clinics and virtual legal assistance, bridging the gap between marginalized communities and justice mechanisms.

While progress has been made, significant challenges persist. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing inequalities and strained institutional capacities, disproportionately impacting vulnerable populations. Mercy Corps has adapted its programming to address these emerging challenges, prioritizing the protection of human rights defenders, promoting access to justice during health crises, and supporting the resilience of judicial and governance institutions.

Ultimately, achieving SDG 16 requires a multifaceted and holistic approach that transcends traditional siloed interventions. Mercy Corps' strategy emphasizes cross-sectoral collaboration, leveraging its expertise in areas such as economic development, youth empowerment, and resilience building to address the root causes of conflict, insecurity, and institutional fragility. By fostering inclusive and participatory governance processes, promoting access to justice, and strengthening the capacities of institutions, Mercy Corps contributes to the creation of enabling environments for sustainable development to flourish.
