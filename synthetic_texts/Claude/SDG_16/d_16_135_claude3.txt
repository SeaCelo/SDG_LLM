Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions), written from the perspective of satirist and columnist Mark Steel:

The Quest for Peace, Justice and Functional Governments: An Admittedly Skeptical Yet Supposedly Humorous Take

As a crusty cynic paid to mock the establishment, I must admit to raising a skeptical eyebrow at the very notion of Goal 16. Peace? Justice? Strong institutions led by uncorrupted officials serving the public good? Are the UN goal-setters bloody delusional or simply unacquainted with the human species?

I mean, we're talking about a planet whose past is essentially one long blooper reel of violence, oppression and leaders behaving worse than bickering kindergarteners. From the Punic Wars to the Crusades to those chaps across the Atlantic having a tiff over whose cotton plantations could treat humans as farm equipment, human history is one continuous hair-pulling brawl. The 20th century alone witnessed two world wars, a celebrated loud-mouth chemically gassing his own citizens, and sundry other governments slaughtering anyone who didn't join their tightey-whitey ideological cliques.

Come to think of it, even my own field is chock-full of supposed purveyors of justice, peace and institutional fortitude getting embroiled in ridiculous scandals. Lest we forget the former Italian Prime Minister shagging underage lovelies, that overly tanned former UK parliamentarian auctioning off access for cash, or a reality TV host oligarch somehow becoming the very embodiment of the American government itself! Who didn't see that solid institution choo-choo train derailing?

Nonetheless, the UN presses on with its admittedly laudable if somewhat sanity-impaired 16th goal. I suppose credit is due for at least acknowledging we remain woefully inadequate at not blowing up or oppressing large swaths of the global population on an alarmingly frequent basis. So what exactly is this 16-pronged unicorn we're meant to pursuit?

Well, for starters, we're tasked with eliminating all forms of violence -- everything from obvious no-nos like war, terrorism and aggressive sarcasm to more oblique transgressions like trafficking, torture and giving someone the stink eye because their barking dog disturbs your drunken afternoon kip. Easy peasy, right? Just sprinkle some fairy dust and Bob's your proverbial uncle.

The goal also handily instructs us to stamp out corruption in all its devious guises while promoting the rule of law -- you know, that hallowed concept where impartial arbiters dole out justice rather than simply persecuting anyone who didn't donate generously to their re-election coffers. Because nothing instills faith in institutions like fair, equitable governance. That certainly doesn't sound utterly alien from the norm of history's conniving oligarchs hoarding wealth and beheading rivals.

Underpinning these lofty ambitions are sub-goals like ensuring public access to information, protecting fundamental freedoms, and strengthening participatory decision-making at all levels. You know, radical notions like citizens actually having a clue what their rulers are up to and a smidgeon of input on the laws and policies impacting their measly lives. Utter poppycock, I tell you! What's next -- expecting governments to work for the people instead of corporate interests?

All snark aside, Goal 16 does read like a rather sublime blueprint for transcending the repressive madness and perpetual tribalism that have tragically characterized the human experience hitherto. Perhaps it's the marginally optimistic part of my wizened soul, but I confess to harboring a faint glimmer of hope that we misanthropic hairless apes might eventually pull our heads out of our collective arses.  

Just this once, I'll opt against concluding with my trademark cynicism. Sooner or later, even the most jaded satirist must acknowledge the value of aspirational visions -- and a world of lasting peace, impartial justice and robust institutions certainly beats the banal hell out of the merciless status quo.
