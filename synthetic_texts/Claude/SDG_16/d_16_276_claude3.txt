Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions), as if written by labor economist Richard B. Freeman:

Promoting peaceful and inclusive societies with access to justice and accountable institutions is a vital objective not just from a humanitarian perspective, but also an economic one. As SDG 16 recognizes, violence, insecurity, and lack of rights erode the foundations for productive labor markets and sustainable development.

My research has long shown that labor institutions and worker voice are critical for raising living standards and reducing inequality. Unions, collective bargaining, and worker representations on corporate boards improve both equity and efficiency. Similarly, having robust rule of law, transparent governance, and accountability of leaders to citizens creates an ecosystem conducive to investment, innovation, and shared prosperity.

Violence and conflict, whether international warfare or domestic unrest, short-circuit economic progress through physical destruction, displacement of people, disruption of trade and supply chains, and diversion of resources away from productive pursuits. The massive loss of life is tragic enough, but conflict also impairs human capital accumulation through reduced schooling and skills erosion. It contributes to a breakdown in social order and institutions.

Even in relatively stable societies, corruption and lack of access to fair justice systems extract an immense economic toll. Bribery raises operating costs and uncertainty for businesses. Cronyism and state capture concentrate resources in unproductive rent-seeking rather than value creation. When citizens cannot access impartial dispute resolution mechanisms, simple transactions become fraught with risk. Property rights become tenuous. The fabric of an economy frays.

Contrastingly, consider the development successes in countries that implemented systemic reforms to root out corruption, enhance transparency, and empower citizens through democratic institutions. While imperfect, measures to improve governance and accountability unleashed economic dynamism by fostering investor and entrepreneur confidence. The lesson is clear: Economic rights and civil rights are intertwined and mutually reinforcing.

This connection between SDG 16 and economic progress underscores the stakes in winning the global fight against transnational criminal cartels, human traffickers, and extremist militias. Beyond immense humanitarian suffering, these forces thrive amid breakdown of state authority. By sowing insecurity in many developing countries, they stymie domestic reform, foreign investment, and the free movement of people, ideas, and commerce so vital for economic advancement.  

Tackling these immense challenges requires innovative solutions that draw on the capacities of states, businesses, civil society, and collaborative global governance. For instance, advancing beneficial digital public goods like encryption and open data can enhance accountability, while securing networks against criminal exploitation. Corporate human rights policies and supply chain due diligence can elevate standards. And channeling diaspora remittances and securitized future flow funds can provide financial lifelines amid conflict.

No single policy prescription fits all contexts. But the overarching imperative is clear: Building inclusive, accountable, and capable institutions responsive to all citizens is an economic and moral necessity to underpin shared prosperity. As labor economists have long argued, giving workers a voice and stake in their societies pays dividends through greater social cohesion, productivity, and sustainable progress. SDG 16 should be a priority for anyone serious about achieving the 2030 Agenda.
