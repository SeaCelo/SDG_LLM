Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions), written from the perspective of Nobel laureate economist Thomas J. Sargent:

Achieving the ambitious targets of SDG 16 - promoting peaceful and inclusive societies, providing access to justice, and building effective, accountable institutions - is a paramount challenge that lies at the heart of economic development and human wellbeing. As a society, we have made progress in reducing violence and increasing political freedoms globally. However, we are still afflicted by endemic corruption, escalating conflicts, human rights abuses, and weak governance that erodes the social contract.

At its core, the existence of strong and inclusive institutions is both an instrumental goal for fostering peace and development, as well as an inherent component of human dignity. Just as a well-designed economic system provides the "rules of the game" that shape incentives and coordinate behavior toward productive activities, so too do political institutions define the constraints and norms that enable cooperation rather than conflict. 

Societies trapped in a "bad equilibrium" of endemic violence, elite capture, and lack of credible commitment devices face a tragedy of the commons - individually rational acts of predation on others undermine the public good of rule of law and social order. We observe this destructive cycle playing out from the narco conflicts in Latin America to the sectarian civil wars plaguing the Middle East.

Escaping these suboptimal equilibria requires careful institutional design and bold reforms backed by a credible deterrent against deviations. Too often, top-down attempts at institutional reform are stymied by time inconsistency problems - new regimes cannot commit to not abusing power themselves in the future. Successful reforms thus require a subtle balancing of "carrots and sticks" to incentivize compliance among entrenched interests.

We can draw insights from the literature on monetary policy rules and central bank independence as a model for depoliticizing state institutions. Delegation of authority to credible, autonomous institutions with well-defined objectives can improve intertemporal cooperation by raising the cost of reneging on promises. Creating a strong, independent judiciary, for instance, makes it harder for political leaders to selectively apply laws for private gain.

International covenants and bodies can potentially help nations credibly lock in institutional reforms by raising the cost of backsliding and pooling reputations across countries. However, the legitimacy and enforcement powers of these entities is still limited. At the end of the day, durable institutional change must be initiated and ratified domestically.

Ultimately, achieving the rule of law rests on shifting societal beliefs and cultural norms around the legitimacy of state authority. It requires a self-reinforcing equilibrium where citizens view institutions as impartial and authorities view themselves as constrained by institutional checks. We need a better positive theory of how societies transition toward such an equilibrium.

More research is needed on optimal design principles, roadmaps for reform sequencing, and mechanisms for influencing beliefs around social norms. The tools of game theory, mechanism design, and behavioral economics can offer insights. But realistically, engineering durable sociopolitical change is an enormous challenge that may take generations given the complexities of coordinating across powerful stakeholders with asymmetric information and incentives.

While the goals of SDG 16 are undoubtedly noble and important for human welfare, we must realistically temper expectations about what can be achieved by 2030. Building lasting peace and rule of law is a continual struggle requiring commitment, perseverance, and enlightened leadership over long time horizons. Yet with coherent strategies grounded in rigorous positive theory, we can make progress - even if imperfectly - toward this vital frontier of human development.
