Here is a draft academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 16 from the perspective of Andrew Bolt:

The Utopian Fallacy of SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Ineffective Institutions

By Andrew Bolt

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 16 - "Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions" - represents a dangerous collectivist ideology completely at odds with liberal democratic values. This misguided utopian scheme naively posits that global institutions can manufacture an environment of peace and justice through top-down diktats. Of course, the reality is that real justice and lasting peace can only emerge organically from the free societies of sovereign nation-states.

The proponents of SDG 16 fundamentally misunderstand the role of the state and its institutions. Strong institutions must be firmly rooted in national identity, culture, and democratic accountability to the citizenry. Unelected global bureaucrats cannot simply decree "effective, accountable and inclusive institutions" into existence across wildly divergent societies. Legitimate authority can only arise from the consent of the governed, not the diktats of a self-appointed internationalist clerisy.

Likewise, the very notion that the UN can legislate "access to justice for all" is farcical on its face. Justice is a culturally contingent concept that means vastly different things to different peoples. To insist on a universalist definition of justice imposed from abroad is the height of arrogance and folly. True justice can only emerge from the practices, traditions, and moral foundations of particular nation-states. Global institutions are fundamentally unable to account for these essential particularities.  

Perhaps most risible is the SDG's fantasy of "building peaceful and inclusive societies." The idea that the UN? has a credible framework to instill societal peace is almost too ludicrous to engage. Look no further than the sectarian bloodbaths that followed UN "peace" operations from Rwanda to Libya. At best the UN excels at well-compensated obfuscation while the developing world descends into anarchic violence.  

Of course, the implicit goal of SDG 16 has nothing to do with genuine peace or justice. It is simply the latest gambit in the UN's long-running campaign to subvert liberal democracy and shake down Western nations for money and power under the guise of vapid do-goodism. The UN's vision is a world of centralized, authoritarian "global governance" - a self-perpetuating oligarchy presided over by ethically rudderless bureaucrats.

The very concept of the UN dictating "Strong Institutions" to sovereign peoples and nations is an oxymoron rooted in radical nihilism. Strong and legitimate institutions can only arise from the organic development of self-governing societies aligned with their national interests. In contrast, SDG 16 is nothing more than a Trojan Horse for a utopian, one-world initiative profoundly destructive to democracy, human rights, and civilization itself.
