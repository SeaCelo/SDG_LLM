At present, one of the greatest challenges facing humanity is achieving sustainable and inclusive economic development, as defined by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8. While substantial progress has been made, particularly in reducing extreme poverty and improving working conditions in many regions of the world, the reality remains concerning.

Economic inequalities continue to widen even within the most prosperous nations. Wage gaps between corporate executives and workers are reaching unprecedented levels, undermining social cohesion and stifling upward economic mobility. Moreover, the economic recovery measures implemented following the COVID-19 pandemic often favored large corporations and publicly traded companies at the expense of small and medium-sized enterprises, which form the backbone of many local economies.

In developing countries, the situation remains critical. Although child labor has decreased over recent decades, an estimated 152 million children are still forced to work, deprived of education and a better future. The informal economy, which accounts for more than 60% of global employment, perpetuates a vicious cycle of vulnerability and precariousness for millions of workers.

These challenges should not discourage us. On the contrary, they should prompt us to rethink our economic and social models to make them more equitable and sustainable. This includes adopting redistributive fiscal policies, making massive investments in education and vocational training, and promoting local entrepreneurship and the circular economy.

Take the inspiring example of Rwanda, a country that endured one of the worst tragedies in recent history but has managed to recover by focusing on sustainable development. Through targeted investments in renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, and women's economic empowerment, the country has achieved sustained economic growth while significantly reducing inequalities and poverty.

Such successes demonstrate that change is possible with genuine political will and the involvement of all societal actors. Businesses, unions, civil society, and governments must collaborate to establish responsible business practices and policies that are environmentally respectful and focused on community well-being.

Achieving SDG 8 is not only an economic imperative; it is also a moral and ethical challenge that questions our very conception of progress and prosperity. We can no longer be satisfied with blind economic growth that benefits a few at the expense of the majority and the planet. It is time to embrace a holistic vision of development, where wealth creation goes hand in hand with social justice, respect for human rights, and ecosystem preservation.

In this era of profound technological, geopolitical, and environmental upheavals, humanity stands at a crossroads. Will we choose to perpetuate the inequalities and imbalances of the past, or will we dare to embark on a new economic paradigm that is fairer, more sustainable, and more respectful of human dignity? The path will undoubtedly be challenging, but future generations will thank us.
