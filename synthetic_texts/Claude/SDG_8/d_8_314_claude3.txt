From the perspective of the Chilean Agency for International Cooperation, Sustainable Development Goal 8 (SDG 8) on decent work and sustainable economic growth represents a multidimensional challenge that requires a holistic and integrated approach. In the Chilean context, we must address persistent gaps in labor inequality, informality, and job precariousness while fostering genuinely sustainable and resilient economic growth.

A key aspect is the promotion of full and productive employment and decent work for all. Although Chile has made significant progress in reducing poverty and creating new job opportunities, challenges related to job quality and the protection of labor rights persist. Labor informality, particularly in sectors such as commerce and services, continues to affect a substantial portion of the workforce, depriving them of access to social security, decent working conditions, and professional development opportunities.

Additionally, we must address persistent gender gaps in Chile's labor market. Despite advances in female labor participation, women still face higher unemployment rates, wage gaps, and a heavier burden of unpaid domestic work. It is crucial to promote policies and programs that encourage equal opportunities, work-life balance, and the elimination of cultural and structural barriers that hinder women's full economic empowerment.

Another critical aspect is fostering sustainable and inclusive economic growth. While Chile has experienced significant economic growth in recent decades, this growth has largely been driven by natural resource exploitation and a development model that has not always accounted for environmental and social impacts. A transition toward a green growth model is necessary—one that leverages the opportunities of the circular economy, energy efficiency, and renewable energy sources while protecting natural capital and promoting social inclusion.

In this regard, it is essential to encourage economic diversification and innovation by promoting the development of emerging high-value-added sectors such as clean technologies, the bioeconomy, and knowledge-based services. This will not only contribute to creating quality jobs and sustainable economic growth but also strengthen the resilience and competitiveness of Chile’s economy in the global context.

Finally, fostering an enabling environment for business development, entrepreneurship, and the formalization of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is crucial. These businesses represent a key source of employment and economic growth in Chile but often face obstacles such as limited access to financing, excessive bureaucracy, and regulatory barriers. By creating a favorable business environment and providing support to SMEs, we can drive the creation of decent jobs, encourage innovation, and contribute to a more diversified and resilient economy.

In summary, achieving SDG 8 in Chile requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the multiple dimensions of decent work and sustainable economic growth. We must promote job formalization, equal opportunities, the transition to an inclusive green growth model, economic diversification and innovation, and the development of a supportive environment for entrepreneurship and business growth. Only through coordinated and multisectoral efforts can we build a truly sustainable and resilient Chilean economy that offers decent work opportunities and a prosperous future for all.
