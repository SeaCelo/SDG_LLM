Mercy Corps is a global humanitarian organization dedicated to alleviating poverty, suffering, and oppression around the world. In this report, we delve into the critical issue of Sustainable Development Goal 8 (SDG 8), which aims to "promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all."

The challenge of achieving sustainable economic growth while ensuring decent work opportunities and promoting social inclusion is a complex undertaking that requires a multifaceted approach. Mercy Corps' work in this domain is guided by a deep understanding of local contexts, a commitment to addressing systemic barriers, and a recognition of the interconnectedness of economic, social, and environmental factors.

One of the core pillars of our strategy is fostering inclusive and resilient economic opportunities. We work with vulnerable communities, particularly those affected by conflict, natural disasters, or marginalization, to create pathways for sustainable livelihoods. This involves strengthening local markets, supporting entrepreneurship, and providing access to financial services, training, and resources.

In regions plagued by conflict and displacement, we prioritize economic recovery efforts that not only provide immediate income-generating opportunities but also lay the foundation for long-term resilience. Our approach involves engaging with local stakeholders, including government agencies, private sector actors, and civil society organizations, to develop context-specific solutions that address the unique challenges faced by displaced populations and host communities.

Furthermore, we recognize the critical role of youth empowerment in achieving sustainable economic growth. By investing in education, vocational training, and entrepreneurship programs tailored to the needs of young people, we aim to equip them with the skills and resources necessary to navigate the evolving job market and contribute to the growth of their communities.

Mercy Corps also places a strong emphasis on promoting decent work conditions and addressing labor rights violations. We collaborate with local partners, businesses, and governments to advocate for fair wages, safe working environments, and the eradication of exploitative practices such as child labor and forced labor. By fostering an enabling environment for decent work, we contribute to the overall well-being of workers and their families, while also supporting sustainable economic growth.

Moreover, our interventions are guided by a commitment to gender equality and the empowerment of women. We recognize that promoting economic opportunities for women is not only a matter of social justice but also a catalyst for economic growth and overall societal development. Through targeted programs and partnerships, we aim to address the systemic barriers that limit women's access to resources, markets, and decision-making processes, ultimately unlocking their full economic potential.

Underpinning our efforts is a strong emphasis on environmental sustainability and climate resilience. We prioritize green economic development strategies that promote resource efficiency, renewable energy adoption, and climate-smart practices. By integrating environmental considerations into our economic development initiatives, we aim to ensure that economic growth does not come at the expense of environmental degradation, thus safeguarding the long-term viability of livelihoods and communities.

Collaboration and partnerships are central to our approach. We engage with a wide range of stakeholders, including local communities, civil society organizations, private sector entities, and government agencies, to foster an enabling environment for sustainable economic growth and decent work. By leveraging diverse perspectives and resources, we strive to develop holistic and sustainable solutions that address the multifaceted challenges of SDG 8.
