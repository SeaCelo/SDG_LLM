The Afghan German Management College presents this analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 8 (SDG 8), which aims to "promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all." Afghanistan's progress toward this goal has been hindered by decades of conflict, political instability, and socio-economic challenges, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent Taliban takeover.

Despite these obstacles, Afghanistan has made efforts to address SDG 8, though progress has been uneven. The country's economic growth has been volatile, with an average annual GDP growth rate of around 2.5% between 2015 and 2020, far below the levels required to achieve sustainable development. The Afghan economy heavily relies on agriculture, which employs about 40% of the labor force but remains largely subsistence-based and vulnerable to climate shocks. Diversification into manufacturing and services has been slow, hampered by infrastructure deficits, a weak business environment, and limited access to finance.

Employment opportunities, particularly for women and youth, remain scarce, with an estimated 23.9% of the labor force unemployed as of 2020. The informal sector accounts for a significant portion of economic activity, with many workers engaged in low-productivity, precarious, and often hazardous jobs without legal protection or social security. The absence of decent work conditions undermines efforts to reduce poverty and inequality, perpetuating a vicious cycle of vulnerability.

Afghanistan's progress in promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth has been hindered by the persistent gender gap in economic participation and opportunities. Cultural norms, limited access to education and training, and safety concerns have restricted women's entry into the formal labor market. The recent Taliban takeover has further exacerbated these challenges, with restrictive policies limiting women's rights and freedoms, including their ability to work and participate in economic activities.

The COVID-19 pandemic has further compounded Afghanistan's economic challenges, disrupting supply chains, reducing remittances, and exacerbating poverty and unemployment. The country's fragile healthcare system and limited social protection mechanisms have left many vulnerable to the pandemic's economic shocks, underscoring the need for resilient and inclusive policies.

To accelerate progress toward SDG 8, Afghanistan must prioritize sustainable and diversified economic growth, coupled with targeted policies to promote decent work opportunities and address structural inequalities. This requires investments in infrastructure, skill development, and an enabling business environment that encourages private sector growth and job creation. Strengthening social protection systems, including unemployment benefits and labor rights protections, is crucial to safeguarding workers' well-being and ensuring a just transition to a more sustainable and equitable economy.

Furthermore, advancing gender equality and empowering women in the labor force is imperative for achieving inclusive economic growth. This necessitates addressing cultural barriers, improving access to education and training, and creating safe and supportive environments for women's economic participation.

Achieving SDG 8 in Afghanistan will require a multifaceted approach that addresses the root causes of economic vulnerability and inequality. Sustained international support, inclusive policymaking, and a commitment to peace and stability are essential for creating an enabling environment for sustainable and decent work opportunities for all Afghans, leaving no one behind.
