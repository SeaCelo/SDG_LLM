Here is a long academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 8 (promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment and decent work for all) as if written by novelist Carl Hiaasen in his distinctive satirical style:

The Swamp Ain't Dry: How Corporate Gluttony is Strangling Decent Work in the Sunshine State

Down here in the great perspiring underbelly of America, we Floridians have a proud tradition of paving over paradises and plundering our natural wonders all in the name of rampant, unrestrained growth. Any shadowy backroom scheme or scuzzy development scam has a bamboozler's chance in the Tallahassee clown college of getting greenlit, no matter how much it desecrates the land, scoffs at sustainability or squeezes the working stiffs.

Take Sugar Cane Conglomorama, the agribusiness juggernaut that sluices billions in subsidies and has the whole state legislature terrified of even sneezing around its platinum-plated execs. Their plantations stretch from the Everglades to Yeehaw Junction, manned by migrant laborers toiling in conditions that would make a chain-gang blanch.

At the height of zafra, the cane-chopping season, whole families are deployed to the fields before rosy-fingered dawn for shift after shift of slashing away at the stubborn stalks. Backs broken, hands shredded, guzzling foul water from polluted ditches just to stay semi-conscious in the blistering heat—and for what? Poverty wages, no health care, squalid camps with zero amenities. Basically, a Dickensian hell-scape of desperation and misery.

And the toil doesn't stop there. After the machete crews finally collapse, semi-trucks groaning with their bitterly harvested loads bray out to the mills. Drivers get jacked up on garish pills just to stay awake for the 20-hour hauls, dodging fronds and wildlife along the dimly-lit rural roads. It's a minor miracle more barrettes don't careen off the shoulderless blacktop into the swamps. But hey, molasses is money honey. Safety schmafety.

Speaking of safety, let's peek inside the refineries where the cane gets rendered into ethanol and granulated sugar, shall we? The "Oven Rooms" are exactly what they sound like—pumped full of superheated vapor that peels layers of skin off any poor puddins who wander too close to the searing machinery. Slip and falls, losing digits, smoke inhalation—it's a grim tally of workplace horrors in these ramshackle, dilapidated mills. But the unions have been thoroughly neutered and the company's productivity insatiable.  

The finished sugar gets packaged by armies of temps in sprawling unstable warehouses, the air thick with particulate clouds of 100% Pure Misery. Minimum wage and zero benefits don't begin to cover the inevitable throat cancers, upper respiratory crises and chronic joint damage that come with the gig.

And where does this mountain of chemical-soaked, blood-drenched sanguineous sugar go? Why, into the snackfood supply chains that load up your supermarket shelves with their luridly-dyed, diabetes-enabling snartwell cookies, chudsorbets and other heart-stoppingly delicious funtimes. The kids go crazy for 'em, because of course marketing geniuses have scientifically calibrated the recipies to burn straight into your brainpan.

The pogies slaving in those cheerless food-processing plants would beg to get the plantation wages and conditions. At least there's fresh air and glimpses of sunlight in the sugarcane hells. Not these Willy Wonka-esque nightmares of molten sugar baths, robo-assemblers popping off limbs, and forklifts driven by the half-blind and narcoleptic.

So the next time you grab a frosty Choke-O-Blast sugar bomb or a Fuddruckers Family Snack-Masher, have a little think about the crewed-over cane-cutters and treat-rasslers who gave their pound of flesh to deliver you that zap of chemical joy. If you're not puking in your mouth a little at the thought, then I haven't done my job here.

Because the harsh truth is, when it comes to decent work and economic sustainability in the Sunshine State, the swamp is anything but drained. The greedy parasite-bastards are sticking it to the little guy all across this stinking boneyard horizontal of a peninsula. In the groves, hotels, brockers, strawsheries, fish farms and sundry other deathtrap workplaces, it's a blazing hellscape for your average Juan Ranchero. Literally dying to make a poverty living. The ultimate bad deal.

So while I slip on my rubber boots and ice vest to report on more atrocities being perpetrated on nature's innocents by the turds who run things down here, you can do your part. Call out these despoiling corporate swine. Boycott businesses that exploit workforces. And if a certain rhymes-with-"sugar" baron invites you aboard his luxury yacht, I suggest you take a BM right on the maindeck. Because we need to fight for a decent planet, with decent wages. Wake up and smell the rancid swamp, people. It ain't getting any fresher.
