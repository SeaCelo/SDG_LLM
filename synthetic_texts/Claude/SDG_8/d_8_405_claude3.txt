The Center for Victims of Torture's analysis of Sustainable Development Goal 8 (SDG 8) – Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all – underscores the intricate relationship between economic development, human rights, and the prevention of torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. 

Poverty, lack of economic opportunities, and exploitation are significant risk factors that heighten vulnerability to torture and ill-treatment. Individuals living in poverty or facing economic hardship are often targeted by state and non-state actors, subjected to coercion, and denied access to justice and remedies. Moreover, the absence of decent work and sustainable livelihoods can foster conditions that enable human trafficking, forced labor, and modern slavery – grave human rights violations that constitute forms of torture.

Conversely, survivors of torture and their families frequently encounter substantial barriers to economic integration and self-sufficiency. The physical and psychological consequences of torture can impede survivors' ability to secure employment, access education and training opportunities, and participate fully in the workforce. Discrimination, stigma, and lack of support services further exacerbate these challenges, perpetuating cycles of marginalization and poverty.

Achieving SDG 8 is therefore critical to addressing the root causes of torture and creating an enabling environment for the protection of human rights. Inclusive economic growth policies that prioritize job creation, social protection, and decent working conditions can mitigate the economic desperation that often drives individuals into situations of exploitation and vulnerability. Furthermore, promoting sustainable economic opportunities for survivors of torture is essential for their rehabilitation, reintegration, and empowerment.

However, it is crucial to recognize that economic growth alone is insufficient to eradicate torture and ill-treatment. Efforts to achieve SDG 8 must be complemented by robust legal and institutional frameworks that safeguard human rights, promote accountability, and ensure access to justice for victims. Effective implementation of international human rights treaties, such as the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, is paramount.

Additionally, a holistic approach to SDG 8 necessitates addressing intersectional issues that exacerbate vulnerability, such as gender inequality, discrimination against marginalized groups, and the disproportionate impact of economic hardship on certain populations. Targeted interventions, including gender-responsive policies, inclusive education and training programs, and targeted support for marginalized communities, are critical to ensuring that no one is left behind.

Ultimately, the achievement of SDG 8 and the eradication of torture and ill-treatment are inextricably linked. By promoting sustainable, inclusive economic growth and decent work opportunities, we can dismantle the systemic conditions that enable torture and create an environment that upholds human rights and human dignity for all.
