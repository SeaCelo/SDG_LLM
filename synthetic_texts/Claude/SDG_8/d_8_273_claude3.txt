Promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment and decent work for all – the focus of the Sustainable Development Goal 8 – is a critical imperative for the global community. As an eminent economist and proponent of rules-based economic policies, I believe achieving this goal requires a multi-pronged approach that balances economic dynamism with social inclusivity and environmental sustainability.

At the heart of SDG 8 lies the pursuit of robust and inclusive economic growth, which has long been a cornerstone of my academic and policy work. Fostering an environment conducive to private sector development, entrepreneurship, and innovation is paramount. This entails maintaining macroeconomic stability, ensuring the rule of law, and promoting open and competitive markets. However, we must also recognize the limitations of unfettered market forces and the need for well-designed regulatory frameworks that mitigate negative externalities and promote long-term sustainability.

A key tenet of my research has been the importance of rules-based monetary policy in achieving price stability and anchoring inflation expectations. Low and stable inflation is a critical enabler of sustainable economic growth, as it fosters an environment of certainty and confidence for businesses and households alike. Central banks must remain vigilant in their pursuit of price stability while adapting their policy frameworks to evolving economic conditions and incorporating new insights from empirical research.

However, economic growth alone is not sufficient to achieve the objectives of SDG 8. We must ensure that the benefits of growth are widely shared and that employment opportunities are accessible to all segments of society. This requires concerted efforts to promote decent work, defined by the International Labour Organization as work that is productive, delivers a fair income, provides social protection, and upholds fundamental rights and principles at work.

A key challenge in this regard is the persistent prevalence of informal employment, particularly in developing economies. Informal workers often lack access to social protections, face precarious working conditions, and are vulnerable to economic shocks. Transitioning towards formality must be a priority, through a combination of regulatory reforms, incentives, and capacity-building initiatives that support the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises.

Furthermore, we must confront the disruptive effects of technological change and automation on labor markets. While innovation is a driving force of economic growth and productivity, it can also lead to job displacement and exacerbate income inequality. Policymakers must proactively address these challenges through investments in education and skills development, enabling workers to adapt to evolving labor market demands. Lifelong learning and reskilling programs are crucial in this regard, as are policies that facilitate labor market mobility and support job transitions.

Achieving sustainable economic growth also necessitates a concerted effort to decouple economic activity from environmental degradation. Climate change and environmental degradation pose existential threats to human well-being and economic prosperity, and we must urgently transition towards a low-carbon, resource-efficient economic model. This requires a comprehensive policy approach that incentivizes the development and adoption of clean technologies, promotes sustainable consumption and production patterns, and places a price on negative environmental externalities.

In this context, I have long advocated for the use of market-based instruments, such as carbon pricing and cap-and-trade systems, to internalize the social costs of greenhouse gas emissions and incentivize the transition towards a green economy. However, these policies must be carefully designed and implemented to avoid unintended consequences and mitigate potential regressive impacts on vulnerable populations.

Ultimately, achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 8 will require a concerted and coordinated effort from governments, businesses, civil society, and the international community. It demands a holistic approach that integrates economic, social, and environmental objectives, while recognizing the interconnectedness of these dimensions and the need for coherent and mutually reinforcing policies.

As economists, we must continue to advance our understanding of the complex dynamics that shape economic growth, employment, and sustainable development. We must remain open to new ideas and perspectives, while grounding our policies in rigorous empirical analysis and a commitment to evidence-based decision-making.

By embracing this approach, we can build resilient and inclusive economies that generate shared prosperity, provide decent work opportunities for all, and safeguard the planet for future generations.
