Here is a draft academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), as if written by Michele Landsberg:

Achieving Equity and Dignity for All Workers: A Moral Imperative

By Michele Landsberg

The global pursuit of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 8 – to "promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all" – represents a profound moral and ethical imperative of our time. Even as the world has witnessed unprecedented economic expansion over recent decades, the harsh realities of exploitation, discrimination, and oppression in the workforce remain rampant and systemic. From the factories of the industrialized world to the fields and sweatshops across the Global South, millions upon millions of workers continue to suffer under conditions that strip them of their fundamental human dignity.

The notion of "decent work" must be interrogated through an intersectional lens that recognizes how factors like gender, race, class, disability status, sexual orientation and immigration status coalesce to create disproportionate barriers and disadvantages in the labor market. Women, for instance, remain drastically underrepresented in leadership roles and overrepresented in informal, insecure and low-wage employment. The gender pay gap persists as a glaring injustice across both developed and developing nations. And for women of color, Indigenous women, and other marginalized groups, these disparities are exacerbated exponentially. Similarly, migrant workers – who prop up major economic sectors in nations across the world – routinely face exploitation, abuse, and a systematic denial of legal protections that renders them vulnerable to the worst forms of labor trafficking and modern slavery.

Decent work defies such dehumanization. It demands that we construct an economic order premised on the core values of equity, dignity, security and justice for all people. It necessitates the institution of robust legal frameworks to safeguard workers' rights, coupled with stringent enforcement mechanisms to hold corporations and employers accountable for any violations. It requires a fundamental rebalancing of power dynamics, emboldening and amplifying workers' collective voices through strong unions and worker-led movements. It obligates governments, industry and civil society to proactively target and dismantle all forms of discrimination, marginalization and exclusion that deprive specific groups of equal economic opportunities.  

Perhaps most critically, advancing decent work on a global scale will require dismantling the pervasive cultural mythologies and flawed economic orthodoxies that have perpetuated the devaluation and exploitation of certain forms of labor – often gendered, racialized, and tied to migrant status. The very construction of global supply chains, for instance, relies on an artificially imposed hierarchy that funnels the most dangerous, insecure and poorly compensated work to those in the Global South – disproportionately women of color – in order to maximize profit margins in the industrialized North. We must reckon with these power asymmetries, not simply through toothless corporate social responsibility campaigns, but by fundamentally reorienting our global economic architecture around promoting shared human dignity.

The road ahead will be arduous. Realizing SDG 8 will demand a profound reckoning with the entrenched legacies of colonialism, racism, patriarchy and neoliberal capitalist expansionism that have generated such grotesque inequalities on a planetary scale. Yet there is no alternative. A just and sustainable future for our world depends on it. Decent work is not simply about employment statistics or GDP metrics – it is about forging an economic praxis rooted in the moral truth that every human being possesses incalculable worth that must be honored and upheld. It is a clarion call to build an economic order where no one is sacrificed, denigrated or discarded on the altar of greed.
