Here goes, an academic article on SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) written from the perspective of Jeremy Clarkson:

Title: Decent Work and Economic Growth - A Petrolhead's Perspective

Right, listen up you mollickers. We're going to talk about one of the most important issues of our time - decent work and economic growth. I know what you're thinking, "Hang on Clarkson, isn't this one of those wishy-washy leftie agendas?" Well, you'd be wrong. Dead wrong. 

This is about making sure everyone has access to the kinds of jobs that let you afford a proper car. None of that Prius nonsense, I'm talking V8s, turbochargers, the lot. You see, without decent economic opportunities, the average bloke is never going to be able to splurge on a nice Jag or a weekend track toy.

Now I'm not saying we all need to be raking it in like oil barons (though that wouldn't be the worst thing in the world). But at the very least, your job should provide enough coin for a well-specced Ford Mustang and ample petrol money to really wring its neck out on a brilliant B-road.

Speaking of which, I went on a proper road trip through the Cotswolds last month in a Rather Brilliant Red Mustang with a 5.0L V8. Civilized enough for the motorway stints, but an absolute riot once you find those glorious isolated lanes. Handbrake turns have never felt so natural.  

But I digress. The point is, economic growth done properly - investing in skills, promoting entrepreneurship, upgrading infrastructure - that's the recipe for giving everyone a fair shot at a job that lets you have a bit of fun with your motor.

Take developing countries for example. I was just in Namibia a few months back, drove the latest AMG C63 from the desert to the seaside. Spectacular machine, sensational roads if you can dodge the wandering wildebeest and elephants. But I couldn't help noticing the shockingly high unemployment, especially among young people. Without a hand up and access to opportunities, how is the next generation meant to enjoy fast cars?

And it's not just the kids either. We need to make sure there are decent jobs for everyone - grannies and grand-dads included. After all, the elderly deserve a bit of driving excitement too before they kick the bucket. Can you imagine your gran's face lighting up as she nails the perfect heel-toe downshift in her turbocharged hot hatch? Priceless.

Now I'm not naive, I know economic progress has to be sustainable, blah blah blah. But hasn't the hot hatch proved that you can have your emissions-friendly cake and eat it too? Something like that new Hyundai i30N with its raucous exhaust popping and banging on the overrun - that's the kind of thing that gets me...ahem, gets everyone excited about the future of transportation.  

At the end of the day, what's the point in creating jobs if those jobs don't let people experience the unbridled joy of driving? Steady employment, decent wages, safe working conditions - it all means nothing if you can't celebrate with the odd track day or a weekend burn-up through the Pennines.

So in summary, you muppets in government and those do-gooding NGOs better pull your fingers out and get serious about SDG 8. Give everyone access to proper jobs that pay well enough to afford interesting cars that are an absolute hoot to thrash about in. Porque no los dos and all that?

If we can manage that, then the world will be a much, much better place. Until next time, thanks for watching and...oh, you're not watching anything. Well anyway, I'm off for a tincy wincy bit of the old vice, a nice glaswegian kiss of single malt scotch. Toodle-oo!
