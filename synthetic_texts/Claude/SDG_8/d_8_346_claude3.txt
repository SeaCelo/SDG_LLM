In an increasingly interconnected world, achieving sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, along with full and productive employment and decent work for all, as outlined in Sustainable Development Goal 8 (SDG 8), has become an unavoidable priority for the international community. The Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID), as the executing body of Spain's international development cooperation policy, has taken a proactive role in advancing this goal through its various interventions in partner countries.

A key focus of AECID's approach to SDG 8 has been promoting development-oriented policies that support productive activities, the creation of decent jobs, entrepreneurship, creativity, and innovation. To this end, the agency has launched numerous programs aimed at strengthening the institutional capacities of partner countries, enabling them to formulate and implement effective public policies that foster a favorable environment for private sector development, attract investment, and generate dignified employment.

In addition, AECID has placed special emphasis on promoting sustainable tourism as a driver of economic growth and job creation. Through initiatives such as the Heritage for Development Program (PATRIMONIOXD), actions have been undertaken to enhance the cultural and natural heritage of partner countries, thereby fostering the development of a tourism sector that respects the environment and local communities.

Regarding youth employment, one of the agency's main concerns has been addressing the challenges young people face in transitioning to the labor market. In this context, vocational training and technical education programs have been implemented to equip young people with the skills and competencies demanded by the labor market, facilitating their integration into quality jobs.

Another critical area of focus for AECID has been promoting gender equality and women's economic empowerment. Through specific programs, efforts have been made to strengthen women's entrepreneurial capacities and eliminate the barriers that hinder their full participation in the labor market and access to productive resources.

It is worth noting that AECID has adopted a cross-cutting approach to implementing SDG 8, ensuring that its interventions simultaneously contribute to other Sustainable Development Goals. For instance, youth employment programs have included components on gender equality and environmental sustainability training, promoting truly inclusive and sustainable economic development.

In summary, AECID has deployed a wide range of strategies and actions aimed at fostering sustainable economic growth, creating decent jobs, and promoting dignified work in partner countries. However, it is essential to acknowledge that the challenges posed by SDG 8 are complex and multidimensional. Achieving this goal requires a joint and coordinated effort by all stakeholders, both nationally and internationally.
