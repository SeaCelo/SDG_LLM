The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) recognizes the pivotal role of Sustainable Development Goal 8 (SDG 8) – Decent Work and Economic Growth – in fostering inclusive and sustainable economic development across our member nations. As an institution committed to catalyzing infrastructure investment and promoting regional connectivity, we understand the intrinsic link between decent employment opportunities, productive capacities, and economic prosperity.

In our analysis, we observe that many countries in Asia and beyond continue to grapple with significant challenges in achieving SDG 8. Persistent issues such as inadequate job creation, widespread informality, gender disparities, and poor working conditions remain formidable obstacles. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing vulnerabilities, leading to unprecedented job losses, business closures, and disruptions to global supply chains.

To address these challenges, AIIB is prioritizing investments that promote sustainable and inclusive economic growth. We recognize that infrastructure development plays a pivotal role in creating direct and indirect employment opportunities, facilitating trade and commerce, and enhancing productivity across various sectors. Our projects aim to catalyze private sector participation, foster entrepreneurship, and support the growth of micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), which are vital engines of job creation and economic diversification.

Furthermore, AIIB is committed to promoting decent work principles, such as fair wages, safe working environments, and social protection measures. We are actively engaged in capacity-building initiatives to enhance labor standards, promote gender equality, and support the transition towards a greener and more sustainable economy. By integrating these principles into our investment decisions, we aim to contribute to the creation of quality jobs and the reduction of inequalities.

One illustrative example of our approach is the AIIB-supported National Transmission Modernization Project in Indonesia. This project not only enhances the country's electricity transmission infrastructure but also incorporates targeted efforts to promote decent work and economic opportunities. Through the project, AIIB is supporting the employment of local communities, providing vocational training, and implementing robust occupational health and safety measures. Additionally, the project aims to foster the growth of renewable energy sources, aligning with the broader objectives of sustainable economic development and environmental conservation.

AIIB recognizes that achieving SDG 8 requires concerted efforts from governments, international organizations, the private sector, and civil society. We are actively engaged in partnerships and collaborations to leverage our collective expertise and resources. By aligning our investments with the principles of decent work and sustainable economic growth, we aim to contribute to the realization of SDG 8 and support our member countries in their pursuit of inclusive and prosperous societies.
