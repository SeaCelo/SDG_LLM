Here is a detailed academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth, written from the perspective of Barbara Amiel:

The Sustainable Development Goals have captivated the minds of bureaucrats and bien pensants the world over, professing lofty ideals about ending global poverty and ushering in a new era of economic prosperity. Goal 8 in particular - to "promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all" - has become a rallying cry for those seeking to impose top-down diktats under the guise of moral rectitude.

Let us examine the inherent contradictions and dubious presumptions underlying this bloated proclamation. How can "inclusive" and "sustainable" economic growth be decreed by fiat? Economic dynamism is an emergent property of free individuals engaging in voluntary exchange, not the result of masterplans concocted by bureaucratic overlords insulated from the rigors of the market. 

The conceit that gathering a cadre of high-minded functionaries can somehow centrally coordinate the incredibly complex dynamics of labor markets and production across the entire planet is hubristic in the extreme. Even in advanced economies, the folly of protectionist policies, burdensome regulations, and profligate taxation in service of such "decent work" agendas has resulted in stagnant wages, persistent unemployment, and the hemorrhaging of industrial capacity.

To conceive that Western elites, marinating in affluence and contemptuous of profit motive, could successfully impose their rarefied notions of "decency" upon the divergent cultures and developmental contexts across the Global South is delusional. The rapid industrialization and modernization of China and the Asian Tigers occurred through embracing market incentives and competitive advantage, not by heeding the diktats of pampered international civil servants.  

For the billions mired in destitution, unshackling from stifling state controls and empowering entrepreneurs has proven the sole catalyzing force in generating sustainable income streams and alleviating systemic poverty. From the teeming favelas to rural agricultural communities, it is capitalist dynamism that offers the impoverished a foothold into self-sufficiency and dignity through productive employment.

To be sure, mitigating the ill consequences of unfettered industrialization is a legitimate role for robust governance. But the development agenda must proceed from the realities of cultural traditions and organic economic evolution, not the abstract musings of a transnational clerisy besotted with their own moral superiority.

Rather than indulging in lofty homilies about reifying some vaporous vision of "decent work", these learned Utopians would be better served embracing the maxim of the great thinker Frédéric Bastiat - "The Great Conflict of Our Century: Individual Liberty vs. Individual Subjugation to Authority."  It is only through empowering the former that the laudable goal of economic emancipation can be achieved.
