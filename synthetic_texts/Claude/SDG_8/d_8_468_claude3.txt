Here is a detailed newspaper article about Sustainable Development Goal 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), written in the style of The Economist:

Unshackling the World's Workers 

The great economic convulsion of the past century was supposed to liberate humanity from toil through machines and technology. Yet for billions, the old curse of drudgery, instability, and exploitation still holds sway. That paradox lies at the heart of the Eighth Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 8) - to "promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all."  

The challenges facing the global workforce are towering. Roughly 700 million people scrape by in extreme poverty, earning less than $1.90 per day. Some 168 million children are condemned to labor that stunts their bodies and minds. Around 40% of workers are in insecure, informal employment without the protection of labor laws or social safety nets. Even among the formal workforce, up to 25 million people are trapped in forced labor. Discrimination shutters opportunity for women, minorities, and the disabled. Grueling hours, appalling conditions, and pitiful pay still run rampant across supply chains.

Slashing such affronts to human dignity holds the key to achieving SDG 8's wider mission of generating "full and productive employment and decent work for all" by 2030. Why is this so vital? Because only productive, rewarding labor unleashes the full potential of human capital - the innovative ideas, skills, and entrepreneurial verve to drive sustainable economic growth and development.

In the advanced economies, this principle powered the takeoff that began two centuries ago. Freeing labor from the farm and factory floor to pursue education allowed talent to bloom. Strong worker protections and rights encouraged expertise to deepen. The rise of the middle class consumer ignited mass markets for innovative new products and services. However, that virtuous cycle has gone into pernicious reverse recently.

With collective bargaining disintegrating, gig jobs proliferating, and regulations eroding, job security and real wages have stagnated for most workers across the rich world. Ordinary people have been cut out of the gains of economic growth. Mistrust of big business and capitalism is poisoning politics. Seizing the productivity benefits of technological disruptions like AI and automation hinges on an equitable rebalancing that restores labor's voice and stake.

In emerging markets, harnessing a decent work agenda offers perhaps the greatest catalyst for rapid economic and human development. Liberate the energies of a billion economically subjugated people by guaranteeing minimum labor standards from child labor to worker safety. Harness female participation through supportive policies. Incentivize firms to formalize employment by cutting regulatory cholesterol. Invest in vocational training and workforce skills matched to sectors fueling the growth of tradable industries and services.  

The $30 trillion in yearly economic output currently lost to deprivation, discrimination, and disadvantage demonstrates the immense growth dividend at stake. Just securing women's equality, for instance, could add $28 trillion to global GDP by 2025. The developing world's leapfrog into digital technologies and green transformation beckons an opportunity to create hundreds of millions of new jobs—but only if labor is empowered and enabled.

Achieving SDG 8's bold vision will not be easy. It demands sweeping, concerted action that touches on thorny issues of political economy, upending entrenched interests, power structures, and social norms. Governments must overhaul education, infrastructure, and regulatory regimes. Social compacts between businesses, workers, and states need modernizing. Cultural hangovers of prejudice require dismantling. But as industrialization, unionization, and the rise of a thriving middle class demonstrated in past transformations, the economic fruits of decent work are unrivalled. Liberating humanity from toil was always an idle fiction; the true emancipation lies in uplifting work that allows each person to fulfill their innate potential—the surest path to shared prosperity in our era.
