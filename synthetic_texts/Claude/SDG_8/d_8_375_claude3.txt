The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) recognizes the pivotal role of Sustainable Development Goal 8 (SDG 8) in fostering inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all. As a member of the World Bank Group, MIGA is uniquely positioned to leverage its expertise in political risk insurance and credit enhancement to catalyze private sector investments that contribute to the achievement of SDG 8.

MIGA's strategic approach to SDG 8 is multifaceted, encompassing various aspects of sustainable economic development. One key area of focus is the promotion of sustainable and inclusive industrialization. By providing risk mitigation instruments to investors in manufacturing sectors, MIGA facilitates the establishment and expansion of industries that create quality jobs, promote technological innovation, and foster sustainable production practices.

Furthermore, MIGA recognizes the importance of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) as engines of economic growth and employment generation. Through its Small Investment Program (SIP), MIGA supports financial intermediaries that provide access to finance for MSMEs, enabling them to grow, innovate, and create decent job opportunities. This not only contributes to SDG 8 but also aligns with MIGA's broader mandate of promoting socially and environmentally responsible investments.

Another critical aspect of MIGA's engagement with SDG 8 is the promotion of decent work and labor rights. By requiring adherence to stringent environmental and social standards, MIGA ensures that projects it supports comply with international labor conventions and provide safe and secure working environments. This includes safeguarding the rights of workers, promoting gender equality, and eliminating child labor and forced labor practices.

MIGA's contribution to SDG 8 also extends to the realm of infrastructure development. By facilitating investments in sustainable infrastructure projects, such as renewable energy, transportation, and telecommunications, MIGA supports the creation of quality jobs and the development of resilient and inclusive economic infrastructure. These investments not only drive economic growth but also contribute to environmental sustainability and climate resilience.

To illustrate the impact of MIGA's efforts, consider its support for a manufacturing project in a developing country. By providing political risk insurance to a foreign investor, MIGA enabled the establishment of a state-of-the-art production facility that creates thousands of direct and indirect jobs. The project not only contributes to economic growth and employment but also prioritizes sustainable practices, worker safety, and skills development. This aligns with SDG 8's targets of promoting sustainable industrialization, decent work, and continuous capacity-building.

In addition to direct project support, MIGA plays a catalytic role in mobilizing private sector investments towards sustainable development objectives. Through its convening power and thought leadership, MIGA actively engages with investors, governments, and other stakeholders to promote responsible and impactful investments. This includes fostering public-private partnerships, developing innovative financing mechanisms, and sharing best practices in areas such as environmental, social, and governance (ESG) integration.

Moving forward, MIGA's commitment to SDG 8 will remain steadfast, as the agency recognizes the intrinsic link between sustainable economic growth, decent work, and overall development progress. By leveraging its unique risk mitigation tools and expertise, MIGA will continue to facilitate investments that create quality employment opportunities, promote sustainable industrialization, and support inclusive and resilient economic growth, contributing to the achievement of SDG 8 and the broader 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
