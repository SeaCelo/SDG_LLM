As the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, it is my utmost priority to shed light on the critical intersection between forced displacement and Sustainable Development Goal 8 (SDG 8), which aims to promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all.

The global refugee crisis has far-reaching implications for achieving SDG 8, as the economic and social integration of forcibly displaced individuals is intrinsically linked to their ability to contribute to and benefit from sustainable economic growth. The challenges faced by refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) in accessing decent work opportunities are multifaceted, ranging from legal barriers to employment and lack of recognition of skills and qualifications, to discrimination, language barriers, and limited access to education and training.

It is imperative to recognize that the economic inclusion of refugees and IDPs is not merely a humanitarian endeavor but a powerful catalyst for economic growth and development. By tapping into the skills, talents, and entrepreneurial spirit of displaced populations, host communities can unlock new sources of innovation, productivity, and economic dynamism.

In this context, the implementation of the Global Compact on Refugees (GCR) takes on paramount importance. The GCR emphasizes the need for a whole-of-society approach, involving governments, the private sector, civil society, and international organizations, to facilitate the economic inclusion of refugees. This includes measures such as providing legal pathways to employment, recognizing qualifications and skills, and fostering entrepreneurship and self-employment opportunities.

One promising initiative in this regard is the UNHCR's Refugee Employment and Entrepreneurship Initiative (REEFI), which aims to unlock the economic potential of refugees by facilitating their access to decent work and self-employment opportunities. Through partnerships with governments, the private sector, and other stakeholders, REEFI supports the development of enabling policy frameworks, skills development programs, and access to financial services and markets.

However, it is essential to acknowledge that the economic inclusion of refugees and IDPs is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Context-specific factors, such as the duration of displacement, the socio-economic conditions of host communities, and the skills and educational profiles of displaced populations, must be taken into account. This necessitates a nuanced and localized approach, tailored to the unique circumstances of each refugee situation.

Furthermore, the pursuit of SDG 8 in the context of forced displacement must be accompanied by efforts to address the root causes of displacement, such as conflict, persecution, and human rights violations. Sustainable and lasting solutions to the refugee crisis require a comprehensive approach that addresses both the immediate humanitarian needs and the underlying drivers of forced displacement.

In conclusion, the achievement of SDG 8 and the economic inclusion of refugees and IDPs are inextricably linked. By leveraging the potential of displaced populations and fostering their economic empowerment, we can not only alleviate their plight but also unlock new sources of economic growth and development. However, this endeavor requires a concerted effort from all stakeholders, including governments, the private sector, civil society, and international organizations, working in tandem to create an enabling environment for the economic inclusion of refugees and IDPs.
