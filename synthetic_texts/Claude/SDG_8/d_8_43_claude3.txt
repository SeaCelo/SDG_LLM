Here is a long academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 8, written from the perspective of Andrew Bolt:

The Myth of "Decent Work" and the UN's War on Capitalism

By Andrew Bolt

Once again, the out-of-touch elitists at the United Nations are trying to push their warped, anti-business agenda on the world with their misguided Sustainable Development Goal 8. This ludicrous scheme, hilariously dubbed "Decent Work and Economic Growth," is really just a thinly veiled attack on free market capitalism and an attempt to hamstring economic prosperity.

The very notion of mandating "decent work" is an Orwellian overreach that should send chills down the spine of every freedom-loving individual. Just who gets to define what constitutes "decent" work? The same out-of-touch bureaucrats who dream up these insipid goals while enjoying their lavish expense accounts and tenured positions? I hardly think a bunch of academics and career politicians ensconced in their ivory towers have any understanding of the real working world.

The proponents of SDG 8 prattle on endlessly about "full and productive employment" and "equal pay for work of equal value," but their myopic vision fails to account for the realities of the market. This one-size-fits-all approach is the antithesis of the competitive free markets that have lifted billions out of poverty around the globe. What these socialist central planners fail to grasp is that market forces must be allowed to determine wages, working conditions, and all other aspects of employment organically.

Don't be fooled by their language about "protecting labor rights" and creating "safe and secure working environments." These are merely Trojan horses designed to concentrate more economic power in the hands of demonstrably inept government bureaucracies while eroding the rights of entrepreneurs, business owners, and industrious workers. Always lurking in the background is their insidious desire to implement more confiscatory taxation and regulatory schemes that stifle innovation and redistributed hard-earned wealth.

The SDGs arrogantly proclaim "sustained and inclusive economic growth" as a goal, without recognizing that top-down management of increasingly globalized markets is a recipe for economic stagnation and crisis. History has shown time and again that free people engaging in free enterprise is the only path to real economic vibrancy and growth that improves living standards across all strata.

We've witnessed the devastation wrought by collectivist policies in numerous socialist "paradises" - starvation, oppression, and economic ruin on a mass scale, all in service of the demonstrably false idea that groups of elites can better determine the optimal distribution of resources and labor than the catalyzing forces of the market. Don't let the lofty rhetoric about SDG 8 fool you; it is merely the latest attempt to turn the world into a horrific real-life embodiment of the prison planet of equality envisioned by Ayn Rand.

At its core, SDG 8 is an anti-capitalist manifesto cloaked in feel-good platitudes carefully designed to appeal to the economically illiterate. The path to true economic empowerment and opportunity for all lies not in centralized planning and "decent work" morality plays, but in the enterprising spirit of free individuals engaging in voluntary market transactions. Any other approach is a road to economic despair and totalitarian privation cloaked in the sheep's clothing of benevolent internationalism. We must reject the SDGs and their "decent work" poison pill entirely.
