The International Organization for Migration (IOM) recognizes the pivotal role of Sustainable Development Goal 8 (SDG 8) in promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment, and decent work for all. As a leading intergovernmental organization in the field of migration, we are acutely aware of the interdependence between labor mobility, economic development, and the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

SDG 8 serves as a catalyst for unlocking the potential of migrant workers, who are often at the forefront of economic activities across various sectors and industries. Through our extensive experience in facilitating safe, orderly, and regular migration, we have witnessed the transformative power of migrant labor in driving economic growth and development.

One of the key targets of SDG 8 is to promote sustained economic growth and higher levels of productivity through diversification, technological upgrading, and innovation. Migrant workers play a crucial role in this endeavor, bringing new skills, knowledge, and perspectives that can ignite innovation and stimulate economic diversification. Their contributions to sectors such as agriculture, construction, healthcare, and technology have been well-documented, underscoring the importance of leveraging their talents and expertise.

Furthermore, SDG 8 emphasizes the creation of decent work opportunities and the protection of labor rights for all, including migrant workers. IOM has been at the forefront of advocating for the rights of migrant workers, recognizing that their well-being and access to decent work conditions are intrinsically linked to sustainable development. Through our partnerships with governments, private sector entities, and civil society organizations, we promote policies and practices that safeguard the rights of migrant workers, ensuring their fair treatment, access to social protection, and a safe and secure working environment.

One notable example of our efforts is the IOM's International Recruitment Integrity System (IRIS), which aims to promote ethical recruitment practices and combat exploitative labor migration. By fostering partnerships between stakeholders, IRIS seeks to reduce the costs of labor migration, enhance transparency, and protect the rights of migrant workers throughout the recruitment process.

Moreover, IOM recognizes the crucial role of migrant remittances in fostering economic growth and sustainable development. Remittances not only provide a vital lifeline for families and communities in countries of origin but also contribute significantly to national economies. By facilitating safe and cost-effective remittance channels, we aim to maximize the development impact of these financial flows, enabling migrant workers to support their families and communities while contributing to the achievement of SDG 8.

As the international community navigates the complexities of the COVID-19 pandemic, IOM remains steadfast in its commitment to SDG 8. The pandemic has underscored the critical role of migrant workers in essential sectors, such as healthcare, agriculture, and logistics, while also highlighting the vulnerabilities they face in terms of job insecurity, access to social protection, and health risks. IOM has actively advocated for the inclusion of migrant workers in pandemic response and recovery efforts, ensuring their access to essential services and promoting policies that protect their rights and well-being.

Looking ahead, IOM remains dedicated to fostering partnerships and collaborations that advance the objectives of SDG 8. We recognize the interconnectedness of this goal with other SDGs, such as SDG 1 (No Poverty), SDG 5 (Gender Equality), and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities). By addressing the multifaceted challenges faced by migrant workers and promoting their integration into host communities, we contribute to the achievement of sustainable and inclusive economic growth, while upholding the principles of human rights and dignity for all.
