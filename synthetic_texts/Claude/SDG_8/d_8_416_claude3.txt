The pursuit of Sustainable Development Goal 8 – Decent Work and Economic Growth – is a critical endeavor that demands a multifaceted approach, particularly in the context of an aging global population. Helpage International, as a leading voice advocating for the rights and well-being of older persons, recognizes the intrinsic link between decent work opportunities and the ability to age with dignity and financial security.

In many parts of the world, older adults face significant barriers to meaningful employment, often stemming from deeply entrenched societal biases and discriminatory practices. This systemic ageism not only undermines their economic potential but also perpetuates cycles of poverty and marginalization. Addressing these challenges requires a paradigm shift in how we perceive and value the contributions of older workers.

One of the key strategies to promote decent work for older adults is to foster age-inclusive policies and practices within the labor market. This involves challenging negative stereotypes about older workers' capabilities and encouraging employers to recognize the wealth of experience, wisdom, and resilience that this demographic brings to the workforce. By providing equal access to training, upskilling opportunities, and supportive workplace environments, we can unlock the untapped potential of older adults and harness their invaluable contributions to economic growth.

Moreover, the promotion of entrepreneurship and self-employment opportunities among older adults can serve as a powerful catalyst for economic empowerment. By leveraging their accumulated skills, networks, and life experiences, older entrepreneurs can not only generate income but also create job opportunities for others, fostering intergenerational collaboration and knowledge transfer.

It is crucial to recognize that the challenges faced by older workers are often compounded by intersecting factors such as gender, disability, and socioeconomic status. Older women, in particular, face disproportionate barriers to decent work, as they navigate the combined effects of gender discrimination and ageism. Addressing these intersectional inequalities requires targeted interventions that tackle the root causes of marginalization and promote inclusive economic opportunities.

Ensuring decent work for older adults also necessitates a holistic approach that considers their specific needs and circumstances. This may involve flexible work arrangements, accessible workspaces, and supportive policies that accommodate age-related health concerns or caregiving responsibilities. By creating an enabling environment that values and supports older workers, we can foster their sustained participation in the labor force, contributing to both individual well-being and economic vitality.

Furthermore, the transition to a green economy presents unique opportunities and challenges for older workers. As industries adapt to sustainable practices and technologies, there is a pressing need for reskilling and upskilling initiatives that empower older adults to navigate these shifts and contribute their expertise to emerging green sectors. Failure to engage and support this demographic in the green transition risks perpetuating economic marginalization and exacerbating intergenerational divides.

Ultimately, achieving Sustainable Development Goal 8 requires a collective commitment to promoting age-inclusive economies that recognize the inherent value and dignity of older persons. By dismantling barriers, fostering inclusive policies, and leveraging the potential of older workers, we can not only advance economic growth but also promote social cohesion, intergenerational solidarity, and the realization of human rights for all ages.
