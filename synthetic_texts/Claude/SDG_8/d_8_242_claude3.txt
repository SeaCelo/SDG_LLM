Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 8 (decent work and economic growth), written from the perspective of Joshua D. Angrist, a renowned economist and professor known for his work on labor economics and the econometrics of causation:

The Elusive Quest for Decent Work and Economic Growth: A Causal Odyssey 

By Joshua D. Angrist

The 8th Sustainable Development Goal aspires to "promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all." This laudable objective represents a monumental challenge for the global community, one that demands rigorous causal analysis and evidence-based policymaking rooted in the tenets of empirical economics.

My odyssey into the thicket of decent work and economic growth issues began with instrumental variables (IV) explorations of the returns to schooling and training programs. Viewing SDG 8 through an IV lens highlights identification headaches that pervade this domain. After all, the characteristics that determine economic outcomes like employment or wage growth are seldom randomly assigned. Education, a cornerstone of decent work prospects, is a quintessential "bad control" rife with selection bias: students choose schooling based on cognitive ability and family resources, and the IV solutions are seldom credible or economically meaningful at scale.

The quest for instruments illuminates deeper questions about the causes of poverty, unemployment, and anemic economic mobility. Do mismatches between the supply of skilled workers and labor demand contribute to joblessness and stagnant wages? Or is workforce readiness symptom rather than cause, a byproduct of institutional factors like feeble tradition of apprenticeships, credit constraints that limit human capital investment, and cultural forces that shape educational preferences? I have used natural experiments to partial out causal effects in these murky waters, for example, exploiting Palestinian job restrictions to study how unemployment shapes fertility and youth employment. While instrumental, such evidence is inevitably local and context-specific.

Still, the caveats that characterize my work apply more broadly. The fetishization of active labor market policies and job training programs is an example of cargo cult empiricism run amok. The billions lavished on these programs are dwarfed by deeper drivers of growth: security, rule of law, economic and social infrastructure, and freedom to innovate. We should interpret microstudies of training programs, microfinance, and make-work schemes with appropriate circumspection. Too often, pithy policy hooks belie the noisy, locally-specific, and resolutely unheroic nature of the empirical findings.

Economic growth, a precondition for decent work opportunities, is another area where causal clarity proves elusive. The disappointing results of randomized asset transfer and cash grant interventions suggest that poverty and unemployment are highly persistent economic equilibria, impervious to small shocks. Structural issues like concentrated landownership, weak investor protection, and trade protectionism loom large. Growth theory remains schizophrenic, torn between professed commitments to institutions and narratives lionizing pro-entrepreneurship nudges and foreign aid. Honest brokers should highlight these causally murky waters.  

My writing has attempted to illuminate these muddy depths through econometric cross-examination. But the empirical record reminds us that decent work remains a Quixotic ideal when injustice, gender discrimination, exploitation, and oppression are pandemically endemic. We should challenge economic precepts that ignore unobservable effort, ubiquitous discrimination, and other manifestations of market failure. Even rigorous empirical work remains haunted by uncomfortable silences about asymmetric information and market power that constrain opportunity. Decent work requires inclusive institutions, not just active labor policies.

Ultimately, the dissonance between the normative aspirations of SDG 8 and the harsh empirical realities expose the naive instrumentalism that has come to dominate evidence-based policy discourse. The fetters on decent work and shared prosperity are forged by political forces antithetical to global sustainability and the economic freedoms needed for meaningful economic transformation. True progress demands difficult institutional reforms guided by honest empirics, not fanciful evaluations of programs untethered from contextualized, multi-disciplinary understanding of complex socioeconomic systems and the political economies that sustain them.
