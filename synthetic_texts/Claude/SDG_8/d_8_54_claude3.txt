Promoting Inclusive and Sustainable Economic Growth, Employment and Decent Work for All: An Appraisal of SDG 8 
By Gavin King

As we approach the halfway point of the 2030 Agenda, assessing progress on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is paramount. SDG 8 – "Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all" – warrants particular scrutiny given its centrality to poverty eradication and sustainable development writ large. This goal represents an interconnected vision transcending economic priorities to encompass social justice, human rights, and environmental integrity. 

The 2008 global financial crisis and subsequent years of austerity exposed the fragility of prevailing economic models predicated on deregulation, privatization and unbridled growth. SDG 8 carries the imperative of reconfiguring economies to be more equitable, ethical and eco-friendly. Fundamentally, it challenges the doctrine of trickle-down economics and the primacy of GDP as the yardstick of progress.

Achieving the SDG 8 targets necessitates structural transformation across multiple domains. Economically, countries must diversify away from overreliance on extractive industries, commodities and low value-added activities. This will require technological upgrading, investment in skills development, and policies incentivizing sustainable industrialization (target 8.2). Enterprise development, formalization of informal enterprises, and access to financial services will be vital for bolstering micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (targets 8.3, 8.10).  

However, delivering decent work opportunities by 2030 is as much a governance challenge as an economic one. Labor market institutions, laws, regulations and enforcement mechanisms must safeguard fundamental principles and rights at work (target 8.8). Eliminating the scourges of modern slavery, human trafficking and child labor is an ethical and legal imperative inextricably linked to broader socio-economic transformations.

Decent work deficits are particularly acute for specific groups warranting targeted interventions. Youth struggle globally with unemployment rates three times higher than for adults (target 8.6). Gender inequalities in employment, pay and workplace discrimination persist (target 8.5). Vulnerable populations like indigenous peoples, ethnic minorities, migrants, refugees and the disabled confront structural barriers compromising their economic security and empowerment.  

Moreover, the greening of economies through sustainable production and consumption patterns (target 8.4) and creation of green jobs is vital. Climate change impacts could push an additional 100 million people into poverty by 2030 if left unaddressed. SDG 8 underscores the need to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation by promoting resource efficiency, clean technologies and a circular economy.

Aid for Trade programs and interventions enhancing domestic resource mobilization capabilities must be prioritized to support least developed countries (target 8.a). Reducing youth unemployment and strengthening institutions to deliver effective, accountable policies and services aligned with SDG 8 also demand robust partnerships and capacity building (targets 8.6, 8.b).

Countries backsliding on their human rights commitments, civil liberties and democratic freedoms will inevitably falter in achieving SDG 8. Safeguarding worker rights, freedoms of association and collective bargaining, social dialogue and tripartism are prerequisites for decent work. Worryingly, the global democratic recession shows no signs of abating as authoritarianism, xenophobia and repression constrict civic spaces in many contexts.

Ultimately, SDG 8 reflects the indivisibility of the 2030 Agenda. It is inextricably interlinked with SDGs on poverty, inequality, gender, education, climate action, peace and partnerships. Building resilient, dynamic and sustainable economies centers on policy coherence and an embrac'ng of a fully integrated sustainable development paradigm in lieu of narrow conceptions of growth. As multiple crises converge, delivering on this transformative agenda is both an ethical obligation and pragmatic necessity for our collective wellbeing and planetary survival.
