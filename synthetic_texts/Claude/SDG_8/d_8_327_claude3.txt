Israel's Agency for International Development Cooperation (MASHAV) recognizes the pivotal role of Sustainable Development Goal 8 (SDG 8) in fostering inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment, and decent work for all. As a nation deeply committed to global development and cooperation, Israel has been actively engaged in promoting SDG 8 through various initiatives and partnerships.

One of MASHAV's key strategies is to leverage Israel's expertise in innovation, entrepreneurship, and technological advancements to drive economic growth and job creation in partner countries. Through targeted capacity-building programs, we share our knowledge and best practices in areas such as agricultural technologies, water management, and sustainable energy solutions. These efforts not only contribute to economic development but also promote environmental sustainability and resource efficiency, which are integral components of SDG 8.

Furthermore, MASHAV recognizes the importance of fostering an enabling environment for sustainable industrialization and innovation. We collaborate with partner countries to strengthen their policy frameworks, regulatory environments, and institutional capacities, thereby promoting sustainable and inclusive economic growth. This includes supporting the development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are crucial drivers of employment and economic diversification.

Promoting decent work and productive employment is another key focus area for MASHAV. We facilitate knowledge exchange programs and technical assistance initiatives aimed at improving labor standards, occupational safety, and workers' rights. By fostering an environment that protects the rights and well-being of workers, we contribute to achieving SDG 8's target of promoting productive employment and decent work for all.

MASHAV's efforts in promoting SDG 8 are not limited to bilateral partnerships; we also actively engage in multilateral initiatives and South-South cooperation. Through platforms such as the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and the International Labor Organization (ILO), we collaborate with other nations to share best practices, leverage collective expertise, and develop comprehensive strategies for sustainable economic growth and decent work.

One notable example of MASHAV's contribution to SDG 8 is our partnership with the Republic of Kenya. Through the Kenya-Israel Industrial Modernization Program, we have assisted Kenyan SMEs in adopting modern manufacturing technologies, improving their competitiveness, and fostering job creation. This program has not only boosted economic growth but has also empowered local communities and promoted inclusive and sustainable industrialization.

In addition to our international efforts, MASHAV recognizes the importance of addressing SDG 8 within Israel itself. We actively support initiatives aimed at promoting sustainable tourism, a key economic sector that creates employment opportunities and drives inclusive growth. Furthermore, we collaborate with local stakeholders to foster an enabling environment for entrepreneurship, innovation, and the development of sustainable industries.

As we progress towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, MASHAV remains steadfast in its commitment to achieving SDG 8 and its interlinked goals. We understand that sustainable economic growth, productive employment, and decent work are not only essential for reducing poverty and promoting shared prosperity but also for creating resilient and thriving societies. By leveraging Israel's expertise, fostering international cooperation, and embracing innovative approaches, we strive to make a tangible impact on the lives of people across the globe.
