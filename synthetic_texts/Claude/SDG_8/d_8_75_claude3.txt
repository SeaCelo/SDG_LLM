Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), written from the perspective of political commentator Mark Steyn:

The Ruinous Pursuit of "Decent Work and Economic Growth"

By Mark Steyn

The great hamster wheel of globalist euphemism keeps turning, and the latest symbolic golden ball for Western societies to chase is the UN's Sustainable Development Goal Number 8 - "Decent Work and Economic Growth." Suffice to say, this is rooted in the same affluent Westerner's piety that informs all the other SDGs - lofty rhetoric camouflaging an agenda of globalist homogeneity that will cripple the few remaining muscles of economic vitality in the developed world.

Beneath the benign terminology about "decent work" there lurks a neo-Marxian demonization of legitimate business operating in the service of consumer demand. What the UN regards as "indecent" work are the myriad jobs created by the free market to fulfill the needs and desires of people in pursuit of their dreams and ambitions. The makers of the latest boy band merch for screaming tweens, Hong Kong's neon-drenched video gamers coding the next big app, American retailers hustling to stack shelves of flat-screen TVs for Black Friday - all these are condemned by the secular theology of theSDGs as debased and unsustainable.

Instead, we are instructed to venerate those forms of "decent work" favored by the global bureaucrats - state-funded makework that exists only to flatten racial, gender and economic disparities rather than create value for consumers. In the SDG paradigm, a Chinese Uighur getting paid $2 a week to stitch Nike sneakers is an exemplar of capitalist exploitation. But a Western diversity consultant making $300,000 a year for lecturing municipalities about intersectionality represents the highest embodiment of "decent work."

As for "economic growth," the SDGs recast this once universally-lauded goal as something to be endlessly conditional upon "sustainability" criteria dreamt up by unaccountable UN panjandrums. Any economic activity that might enhance human flourishing around the planet gets kiboshed if it falls afoul of whatever the current sustainability dogma happens to be - from the European Union's carbon directives to Canadian environmental groups blocking resource extraction.

Ultimately, SDG 8 seeks not to unleash truly "decent work" or wealth creation, but to rebrand the unglamorous reality of top-down global governance as a planetary exercise in egalitarian do-goodism. The decent job you think you have, providing goods and services people demonstrably want? Not so fast, comrades - the UN's calibrations have determined that your labor is a crime against environmental and social justice. Meanwhile, the privileges and material comforts enjoyed by the bi-continental activist class jetting between Davos and UN confabs will be sanitized as shining examples of "decent work" - because they're the ones formulating the rules!

If the aim was to freeze the world's struggling masses into permanence as impoverished wards of richer nations' bureaucracies, SDG 8 represents a brilliant strategy. But for nations that still harbor hopes of reviving some of that old get-up-and-go spirit that made the West wealthy and wildly successful - pursuing these hollowed-out buzzwords is a recipe for disastrously unsustainable decline.

We are a long way from Adam Smith's insistence that increasing "the revenue and employment of the people" was a surer path to human betterment than government interventionism. Instead, an unelected global kleptocracy claims dominion over designating which forms of rewarding toil are "decent" and "sustainable." All the old verities are inverted - the bureaucrat luxuriating in Turtle Bay high-rises is celebrated while the truck driver schlepping another load of stuff we want is demonized.

Perhaps the greatest indictment of the perverse SDG 8 mindset is that Nigeria, with its endemic corruption and systemic failures, currently ranks 15th out of 193 nations in achieving Goal 8's targets. But innovators like America and Switzerland - those ingenious nations that should be the envy of the world - are mired in the bottom half. It's the final reductio ad absurdum of the UN's depraved value system that hard work and inventiveness are stigmatized while kleptocratic slackers are valorized.   

Instead of humbly emulating societies that have lifted billions from poverty through free markets and muscular entrepreneurial self-reliance, the UN prefers a hackneyed "sustainability" pantomime of chastising the productive and subsidizing the uncompetitive. SDG 8's conception of "decent work" and "economic growth" is an insult to human dignity and aspiration. Prosperity and independence are the birthrights of free peoples, not commodities to be rationed by planners and central committees. Our path forward lies in dismantling such pernicious impediments to human potential.
