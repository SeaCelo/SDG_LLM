Decent work and economic growth - sounds simple enough, doesn't it? But when you peel back the layers on this particular Sustainable Development Goal, you quickly realize it's a minefield of political pitfalls and partisan point-scoring. As I've observed over decades in the Canberra bunker, SDG 8 is less about shared vision and more about scoring cheap political shots.

Let's start with the elephant in the room - successive governments paying lip service to this goal while turning a blind eye to exploitative work practices and stagnant wages. The rhetoric around promoting "decent work for all" is just that - rhetoric. In reality, we've seen casualization run rampant, the gig economy flourish with minimal protections, and real wage growth eke along at a glacial pace. It's the height of hypocrisy for our leaders to trumpet their commitment to SDG 8 while doing precious little to curb workplace abuses happening right under their noses.

And that's before we even get to the economic piece of the puzzle. For all the chest-puffing about GDP figures and job creation stats, the reality is our productivity levels are chronically sluggish. Rather than tackling this head-on, our politicians engage in ideological turf wars - Labor pushing for more spending and intervention, the Liberals clinging to their trickle-down fantasies. Meanwhile, issues like skills shortages, crumbling infrastructure and red tape strangulation get paid little more than lip service.

Lest I be accused of Canberra-centric cynicism, let me be clear - there are some pockets of progress to be found. Corporate titans are gradually waking up to the importance of ethical supply chains and responsible practices, albeit under public pressure. Universities and research bodies are doing critical work mapping pathways to more sustainable, inclusive economic models. But these bright spots only serve to highlight the real roadblocks - a lack of cohesive national leadership and willpower to drive meaningful, lasting reform.

At its core, SDG 8 should be a galvanizing force bringing together government, business, unions and civil society behind a shared vision of economic rejuvenation and workplace empowerment. Instead, it's been reduced to a political punching bag - a chance to land blows on opponents while conveniently ignoring one's own shortcomings. Perhaps it's time we finally had an honest national conversation about what "decent work" and "sustainable economic growth" really mean in the modern Australian context. Although, knowing this town, I won't be holding my breath.
