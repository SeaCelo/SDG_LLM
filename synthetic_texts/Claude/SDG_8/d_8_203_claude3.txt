Here is a detailed academic article about the UN's Sustainable Development Goal #8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth, written from the perspective of renowned writer Gene Weingarten:

The Audacity of Decency: Musings on SDG 8
By Gene Weingarten

Let's talk about work, shall we? Specifically, let's ponder the lofty notion of "decent work" as championed by the United Nations via its 8th Sustainable Development Goal. On its face, it's a rather oxymoronic concept - work being decent? Come now, since when has labor, toil, drudgery and soul-sapping monotony ever aligned with decency? Work is the primordial curse, the punishment for that naughty little incident with the snake and the forbidden fruit back in the glory days of Eden. To imbue work with the quality of "decency" is akin to spiking motor oil with French vanilla - an appalling insult to the pristine nature of indecency.  

And yet, I find myself oddly seduced by the very audacity of SDG 8's premise. Its creators clearly understood the innate human tendency to begrudge honest labor, so they dangled the carrot of "decency" to make the pill easier to swallow. It's marketing genius, really - take something universally loathed and rebrand it as a moral imperative, a societal obligation to pursue not just any work, but decent work with a jaunty lilt. Who can refuse such an entreaty without feeling like a terribly indecent sort?

But what, pray tell, constitutes "decent work" in this exalted formulation? The criteria are nebulous at best - productive employment, fair pay, safe working conditions, social protections, rights at work...yadda yadda yadda. It all sounds terribly responsible and civic-minded, but doesn't it just put the "Hum" in "human resources?" Even the worst knackers and calcine furnace operatives can find meaning in promoting "resource efficiency in consumption and production" if you sprinkle enough euphemistic fairy dust.

Perhaps I'm being too cynical here. After all, the goal does strive to "eradicate forced labor, end modern slavery and human trafficking," which is certainly a noble cause. Though one could argue there's nothing more antithetical to human decency than subjugating fellow humans to forced labor in the first place. It's like a mugger patting himself on the back for only taking your wallet, not your life. Not exactly a high bar for basic decency.

And then there's the baffling matter of SDG 8 advocating for "decent job creation" alongside sustainable tourism as key engines for future economic growth. Sustainable tourism? You mean those bacchanals of crass consumption and carbon-spewing transit? Those drunken scourges inflicted upon quaint locales by throbbing hordes seeking the umpteenth Instagram shot of themselves leering before some cultural landmark? Is despoiling indigenous societies considered decent work now? I shudder to think what constitutes indecency in this new moral paradigm.

Yet for all my mocking cynicism, a part of me wants to drink the SDG 8 Kool-Aid. In a world hideous with exploitation, inequity, and institutionalized avarice, fronted by profiteering ghouls who wouldn't know decency if it bludgeoned them with C.S. Lewis novels, this goal's championing of basic worker protections becomes strangely poignant. It gestures, however inarticulately, at restoring some modicum of dignity to the daily grind endured by billions.

So fine, I'll strap on the rose-tinted goggles and embrace SDG 8's soaring aspirations for a more decent economic order. It's a shamelessly lofty aim, but no more preposterous than the notion of global cooperation itself. If we can collectivize our idiocy around weapons, subjugation, and ecodecimation, surely we can marshal the audacity, just this once, to bestow the gift of decency upon the huddled masses yearning to work non-indecently? One can only hope we'll forgive ourselves the indecency of such idealism.
