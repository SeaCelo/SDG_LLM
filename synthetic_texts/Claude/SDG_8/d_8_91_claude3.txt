Here is a detailed academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 8 from the perspective of Mrinal Chatterjee, a noted development economist and public policy expert:

Decent Work and Economic Growth: Catalyzing Sustainable Human Progress (SDG 8)

The 2030 Agenda's call to "promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all" resonates profoundly with the ethos of equitable development that has anchored my life's work. SDG 8 encapsulates the intrinsic linkages between robust economies, dignified labor opportunities, and the transformative scope of sustainable livelihoods - an indivisible triad pivotal to eradicating poverty in all its multidimensional forms.

It is instructive to historically situate this ambition against the discourse of the post-War era that indelibly shaped development theory and practice. The seminal trabalhos of Prebisch, Singer, Myrdal and Lewis advocated structural economic transformations leveraging industrialization and modernization to catalyze productivity, spawning the influential "growth paradigm." While facilitating technological progress and capital accumulation, this model subordinated socioeconomic equity and environmental integrity - consequences starkly evident in the persistence of mass deprivation amidst pockets of affluence globally.

SDG 8 emerges as an evolved, holistic blueprint - balancing the pursuit of broad-based prosperity with the parallel imperatives of social inclusion and ecological sustainability. This cohesive vision demands transitioning beyond conventional output-oriented growth prescriptions towards a conceptually rigorous, empirically-grounded understanding of "development as freedom" expounded by Sen and Nussbaum. It obliges expanding substantive choices for leading lives of agency, dignity and creative fulfillment - fundamentally achievable through access to gainful employment opportunities under conditions of decent work.

By emphasizing "full and productive employment," Target 8.5 spotlights the centrality of leveraging labor's productive potential as a driver of sustained income growth and poverty reduction. Yet employment alone is insufficient - reaffirming the inextricable connection with Target 8.8's focus on safeguarding labor rights and promoting "safe and secure working environments for all workers." The notion of "decent work" upholds core ILO conventions on issues ranging from freedom of association and collective bargaining to eliminating forced labor, human trafficking and worst forms of child labor.

Embedded within SDG 8 is the recognition that entrenched structural impediments, both economic and social, have perpetuated labor market segmentation, discrimination and exclusion across dimensions of gender, ethnicity, disability status and rural-urban divides. Thus, ensuring "equal pay for work of equal value" (Target 8.5) and economic empowerment is imperative for marginalized groups including women, youth, persons with disabilities, and other vulnerable cohorts. 

In the Global South contexts I've engaged with intimately, addressing pervasive informality looms as a formidable policy priority inextricably tied to SDG 8's agenda. The informal economy's low productivity traps, meager incomes, precarious employment conditions and lack of social protection represent Gordian knots stymieing decent work expansion. Catalyzing transitions to formal work necessitates strategic interventions transcending labor regulations - encompassing access to affordable credit, skill development, technology diffusion and reforming regulatory frameworks.

The imperative of "decoupling economic growth from environmental degradation" (Target 8.4) underscores an overarching paradigm shift embodied in SDG 8. It challenges conventional production and consumption patterns predicated on unsustainable resource exploitation and greenhouse gas emissions that have precipitated the climate crisis. Fostering "green economies" anchored in resource-efficient, low-carbon industries and sustainable tourism requires supportive national policies, technological innovation, collaboration between public-private spheres, and reshaping consumer behavior. 

In summation, SDG 8 encapsulates the complex dialectics of reconciling dynamism with distributional equity and sustainability - posing profound conceptual and pragmatic challenges in transcending entrenched policy silos. Truly operationalizing this ambition demands coherent, context-sensitive strategies informed by interdisciplinary insights at the confluence of economics, sociology, environmental studies and development ethics. Only by adopting this nuanced, eclectic framing can the international community harness the catalytic force of decent work and inclusive economic growth as penultimate enablers of the overarching vision of sustainable human progress.
