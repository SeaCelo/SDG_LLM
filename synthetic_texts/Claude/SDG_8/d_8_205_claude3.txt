Here is a detailed, comprehensive academic article about UN Sustainable Development Goal 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), written from the perspective of the late economist Walter E. Williams:

The Noble Pursuit of Productive Labor and Economic Prosperity

By the esteemed economist Walter E. Williams

As a steadfast proponent of free market economics and ardent defender of liberty, I approach the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 8 – "Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all" – with a discerning eye. While well-intentioned, this endeavor must navigate a delicate balance between fostering economic dynamism and respecting the autonomy of individuals and enterprises.

At its core, productive labor represents the noblest of human pursuits – the channeling of our industrious spirit to create value, sustain our livelihoods, and propel civilization ever forward. The right to engage in unmolested economic activity, free from excessive government meddling, stands as a bulwark against tyranny and a catalyst for human flourishing.

History has borne witness to the unparalleled power of free markets in catalyzing economic growth, innovation, and rising living standards. From the Industrial Revolution to the modern-day tech titans, unfettered entrepreneurship and voluntary exchange have lifted billions from abject poverty. In this light, SDG 8's call for "full and productive employment" should be approached pragmatically.

Top-down mandates and heavy-handed labor regulations, however well-meaning, often engender unintended consequences – stifling job creation, discouraging investment, and calcifying economic mobility. Witness the plight of nations shackled by intrusive labor laws and stringent hiring practices, where stagnation and high structural unemployment fester.  

Instead, we must embrace policies that remove barriers to entrepreneurship, incentivize capital formation, and safeguard the sacred rights of private property and freedom of contract. By fostering a conducive environment for risk-taking and rewarding productivity, the invisible hand will guide resources to their highest-valued use, maximizing employment opportunities organically.

Furthermore, the concept of "decent work" warrants scrutiny. While ensuring basic labor standards and worker safety remains a worthy goal, attempts to enshrine a one-size-fits-all conception of "decent" work are inherently subjective and risk breaching the inviolable sphere of personal choice.

What one individual deems "decent" may be another's arduous toil – the ambitious entrepreneur embracing long hours, the unskilled laborer grateful for an entry-level wage, the artist sacrificing comfort for their craft. Economic freedom empowers individuals to pursue their desired work-life balance, whether prioritizing higher pay or greater leisure.

Moreover, economic growth itself serves as the greatest catalyst for improving worker conditions and raising living standards across the socioeconomic strata. As productivity and wealth accumulate, employers must compete for talent by offering attractive compensation and workplace amenities – a dynamic that has spurred the rise of modern workplace benefits and increased bargaining power for employees.

Ultimately, the path to realizing SDG 8 lies not in heavy-handed interventions or one-size-fits-all diktats, but in steadfastly defending the principles of economic liberty that have proven time and again to be the wellspring of broad-based prosperity. By securing property rights, upholding the rule of law, and allowing the invisible hand to allocate resources efficiently, we create an environment conducive to entrepreneurship, job creation, and organic improvements in living standards.

While well-intentioned global initiatives can raise awareness, true and lasting progress demands an unwavering commitment to the timeless values of free markets, personal responsibility, and limited government interference in productive private endeavors. For it is only when individuals are liberated to channel their industry and ingenuity towards value creation that the noble pursuit of productive labor can fully bear fruit.
