Here is a long detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), written from the perspective of satirist Mark Steel:

Decent Work? More Like Decrepit Drudgery If You Ask Me

Let's take a look at this Sustainable Development Goal lark, shall we? Specifically SDG number 8 which is all about "promoting sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all." Well I've got a few issues with this one right off the bat.

Firstly, the use of the word "decent" seems a bit of a stretch in relation to work, doesn't it? When was work ever decent? Perhaps for a brief window in the late 1970s when surnames like "Smeghead" and "Trottingbottom" were still considered delightfully whimsical rather than just crass and offensive. But other than that, work has been uniformly indecent throughout human history.

We're talking about spending 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, year after year, being bossed around by some white-collar pen-pusher whose only qualifications are a nice haircut and the ability to keep a straight face while chattering inanities about "synergies" and "thinking outside the box." All so we can slowly save up enough pennies to enjoy a few short decades of apparent leisure before our bodies pack in and we're too decrepit to do anything more strenuous than mouth-breathe into a mug of Ovaltine.

And what is this "full and productive employment" they speak of? More like "full and purposeless busywork" if you ask me. We're assigning masses of human minds and hands to utterly meaningless tasks - scribbling in ledgers, tabulating figures, collating reports that nobody will ever read except when using them as bum-wad in the stationery cupboard. All to produce a bunch of mass-produced Snickers bars or aluminum cans or whatever that will just get thrown away and replaced by more pointless crap next year.

The only economic growth we ever see is a continuous upsizing of the chief executives' salaries and bespoke wristwatches. For us drones down in the pits, it's a lifetime of having the same dreary indignities and petty humiliations shaved into our souls by the pitiless, soul-destroying routine.

But I suppose that's why they had to slip in the word "sustainable" as well, just to add a bit of fluffy greenwashing to the whole endeavor. As if shipping container loads of disposable plastic doodads across the planet in perpetuity qualifies as "sustainable" just because they've employed a few thousand half-wits to operate the machinery.

The global economy has become a giant Rube Goldberg machine designed to maximize employment by dreaming up ever-more complicated and ludicrous types of entirely unnecessary labor tasks to occupy the human masses and maintain the illusion of purpose. When really it's all just rearranging the same heaps of metallic corn flakes and piles of brightly colored chicken fuzz while the world's ecosystems choke and sputter their way towards a smoggy, arid oblivion.

But what's the alternative? That we all just lounge about enjoying modern labor-saving technologies and appreciating each other's talents and cultivating our minds and creative potentials? Rather than toiling in factories extruding endless reams of shrink-wrapped plastic tatt destined to spend eternity spinning in the great oceanic rubbish vortexes?

Well I'll be the first to admit that pursuing gardening and philosophical debate as an alternative model of organizing society does sound fairly bucolic and idyllic. But where's the profit incentive in that, eh? Where are the ample opportunities for rapacious corporate exploitation and quasi-indentured servitude? For unscrupulous oligarchs to amass decadent fortunes by playing funny-number games and convoluted arbitrage schemes while the plebs subsist on crumbs and subservient deference?

No, much better to dress it all up with lofty language about "sustainable economic growth" and "decent employment." Slap that feel-good label on it and send the masses back into the sudsy, undignified grind. At least that way the hampster wheels of late-stage capitalism can keep on spinning for a while longer before the whole shithouse goes up in flames.

So there you have it - SDG 8 laid bare! Sustainable, my eye. Decent work for who exactly? The ones profiting from everyone else's toil and drudgery, as always. But I'm sure the urbane peddlers of such ideals mean well. It's just that their well-meaning policymaking is about as effective as calling out "Has anyone seen my glass eye?" while the room's ablaze around them.

But hey, at least the coded jargon sounds progressive and morally placating, right? Just don't look too closely at what's actually being peddled behind those innocent verbal fripperies. Otherwise you might start questioning the whole rickety, exploitive, ecocidal mess we've somehow accepted as "economic growth" and "decent work" for all...and we can't be having that, can we?
