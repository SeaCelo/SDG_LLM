Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), written from the perspective of Richard Littlejohn:

The Utopian Folly of the UN's Labour Fantasies

Leave it to that ineffectual gaggle of globalist busybodies at the United Nations to dream up yet another ridiculous, unmeetable set of pie-in-the-sky goals completely detached from reality. Their latest crusade, dubbed "SDG 8" calls for promoting "sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all" by 2030. Let's examine the utter absurdity of these neo-Marxist fantasies, shall we?

To begin with, the very notion that the inefficient, bureaucratic United Nations has any authority to dictate employment policies to sovereign nations is patently offensive. Since when did unelected, Learjet-liberal mandarins at this supra-national busybody club obtain jurisdiction over the workplace rules and regulations of member states? It smacks of a brazen overreach clearly intended to undermine national sovereignty.  

But even putting that arrogant power grab aside, the specific goals themselves are utterly risible. Just consider the first tenet, which demands "full and productive employment" within the next few years. Even putting aside the nebulous definition of what constitutes "productive" work in our modern service economy, the fact remains that a certain level of frictional unemployment is not only unavoidable but economically desirable in a dynamic jobs market. Rapid technological disruption and the constant churn of job creation and destruction renders the concept of "full employment" positively quixotic in the 21st century. 

As for the call for "decent work for all" - who decides what occupations meet these subjective "decency" criteria? Does that mean hard labourers engaged in back-breaking but well-compensated toil like mining, construction, or manufacturing are ruled out? What about unglamorous but economically vital jobs like abbatoir workers, sanitation engineers, or fracking crews? I suspect the UN's Latte-sipping snobs wouldn't deem such vocations as decent enough to meet their arbitrary standards.  

The delusional impracticality only escalates from there. There are calls to reduce the proportion of youth not in employment or education by 2020 - noble in theory, but a hopelessly unrealistic goal given ingrained systemic challenges and socioeconomic headwinds that cannot simply be wished away with sanctimonious targets. Economic growth rates for the least developed countries are meant to be sustained at 7% per year - except the UN provides no blueprint whatsoever for how such meteoric expansion could conceivably be achieved beyond crossing their fingers and chanting buzzwords like "policy coordination."  

Other goals, like building resilient infrastructure and promoting sustainable tourism, start out seemingly benign before devolving into meaningless green gobbledegook about combating climate change. Of course, no UN treaty would be complete without hefty wealth transfers from successful nations to developing kleptocracies - all under the guise of promoting "policy coherence" and respecting labour rights, whatever those malleable terms are meant to convey this week.

At its core, SDG 8 is simply the latest lofty proclamation by an unaccountable international cabal to expand their spheres of influence over hard-working citizens under the pretense of a utopian labour agenda. In practice, it represents an alarming overreach into the domestic policies of self-governing states under the dubious rubric of promoting rights and economic growth. Its component objectives are hopelessly vague, profoundly unrealistic, and almost certainly unattainable within the stated timelines.

The saddest aspect, however, is that billions in Western taxpayer funds will almost certainly be frittered away vainly chasing these quixoticSustainable Daydreams, lavishing ever-greater funding on the UN's bloated, potentate-coddling bureaucracy. Rather than pour money down this bottomless sinkhole, Western democracies would be far better served repatriating those funds to uplift their own workers and industries. Let the hubristic philosophers at the UN Abattoir fight their shadows and pursue their fantastical windmills elsewhere.  When it comes to jobs and economic policy, sovereign nations would be wise to ignore these laughable diktats from a demonstrably incompetent supranational busybody and pursue their own national interests as they see fit.
