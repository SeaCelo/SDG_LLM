Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), written from the perspective of the late economist Alan B. Krueger:

The Imperative of Decent Work and Inclusive Economic Growth

As an economist, my life's work has been committed to studying and promoting labor market policies that uplift workers and enable stronger, more sustainable economic growth. Sustainable Development Goal 8 cuts to the core of that mission by highlighting the necessity of "promoting sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all." This mandate is as crucial as it is daunting, requiring nuanced policy interventions across multiple fronts.

To begin, we must contend with the scourge of labor market discrimination that has plagued economies worldwide. My research has shown that discriminatory hirmg practices based on race, gender, and other protected characteristics remain pervasive and impose massive social costs. Audit studies continuously demonstrate that resumes with minority-sounding names receive substantially fewer callbacks than majority equivalents. Women's wages trail men's even after controlling for experience, education, and career fields. If we allow such discrimination to persist, economies will operate inefficiently by misallocating human capital based on non-productive attributes.

The solution lies in reinvigorated anti-discrimination policies, litigation to combat violations, and concerted efforts by employers to identify and root out biases in hiring and promotion practices. Simply put, labor is one of an economy's core inputs; failing to optimize its deployment is akin to deliberately hampering productivity. An ethical framework centered on equal opportunity isn't just a moral imperative, but an economic one as well.

Beyond eliminating discrimination, we must tackle chronically low labor force participation (LFP) rates that have plagued many nations in the post-recession era. Research shows a range of factors undermining LFP, including inadequate childcare options, logistical barriers to job searching, and lack of skills alignment with open positions. A policy blend of childcare subsidies, transportation grants, job search assistance programs, and workforce retraining initiatives could prove transformative in activating sidelined workers.

Regulatory reform also carries promise for boosting employment rates. Occupational licensing requirements have proliferated in recent decades, often with minimal quality enhancements but higher barriers to entry. Judiciously curtailing excessive licensure could expand employment opportunities without compromising consumer protections. Similarly, zoning constraints that restrict labor movements should be reconsidered where costs likely exceed benefits.

That said, removing labor market frictions will prove insufficient if domestic demand remains suppressed – employment opportunities are inherently limited if business growth stagnates. Here, targeted fiscal policies like public investments in infrastructure, R&D incentives, and subsidies for high-productivity industries offer a potential path forward. Governments can quite literally employ workers through public works programs while catalyzing private sector expansion.

Crucially, we must recognize that economic growth alone does not constitute "decent work" if gains accrue solely to capital owners rather than labor. Rising income inequality has plagued most advanced economies in recent decades, fueling social unrest and populist backlash. Strengthening collective bargaining rights, establishing wage boards to negotiate minimum compensation standards, and exploring paths to broader profit-sharing could help rebalance factor shares towards workers.

Ultimately, while the aforementioned measures can bend the curve towards SDG 8's targets, we cannot ignore the elephant in the room: automation and artificial intelligence (AI) stand poised to revolutionize employment markets globally. Current projections suggest that up to 47% of U.S. jobs face high automation risk over the next two decades, with similarly alarming figures worldwide. Policy intervention will prove essential to facilitating workforce transitions into viable replacement careers.

Historically, previous automation waves have generated at least as many job opportunities as they destroyed – but only after workforce realignment through retraining, migration, and demographic shifts. Government policy and planning must expedite such readjustments by providing robust education funding, relocation assistance, and rapid credentialing pathways to emerging fields. We economists can also aid these efforts by modeling likely future automation trajectories, allowing policymakers to preemptively upskill workers for in-demand occupations.

The challenges of achieving SDG 8 by 2030 should not be understated. Its success hinges upon a sweeping reimagination of labor markets and a steadfast commitment to the dignity of work. But in a globalized, technology-disrupted era, the economic – and moral – costs of inaction would prove even greater. If we truly wish to "leave no one behind," the quest for decent work must rank among our highest priorities.
