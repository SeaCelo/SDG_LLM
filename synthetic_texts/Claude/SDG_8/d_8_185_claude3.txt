Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) written from the perspective of political cartoonist and columnist Ted Rall:

SDG 8 and the Myth of "Decent Work" Under Capitalism

By Ted Rall

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 8 calls for "promoting sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all." A laudable aim in theory, but one that is fundamentally incompatible with the dictates of global capitalism and the remorseless exploitation of workers under the existing system. 

Let's start with the stated goal of "decent work for all." What constitutes "decent" work is, of course, subjective. But by any reasonable definition, toiling in brutal conditions for poverty wages with minimal to no benefits or job security can hardly be considered decent. And yet this is the grim reality for countless millions across the developing world fueling rapacious multinational corporate profit engines.

The supply chains of virtually every major apparel brand feature sweatshops staffed by desperately poor workers enduring 14+ hour days, squalid living quarters, intimidation and physical abuse. In Bangladesh, over 1,100 garment workers perished in the 2013 Rana Plaza building collapse - just one horrifying example among many underscoring the dehumanizing deathtrap conditions that service our Western consumer appetites and corporate bottom lines.

The situation is no better in China's export-driven factories, with endemic excessive overtime, paltry wages as low as $1/hour, rampant safety violations, and violent suppression of independent labor organizing. Workers making electronics for major brands like Apple routinely work over 60 hours per week, vastly exceeding legal limits.  

Even in sectors not engaged in product manufacturing or extraction of cheap resources, financial giants headquartered in gleaming towers treat their own employees as utterly disposable cogs - as the banking industry's long-revered practice of systemic age discrimination makes clear. Any notion of "decent" work goes out the window here.

Of course, these egregious labor abuses form the foundation for robust corporate profit margins and economic growth statistics that the capitalist system reveres above all else. SDG 8's quest for "sustained, inclusive economic growth" is effectively code for protecting and perpetuating this same ruthlessly exploitative profit extraction model on a planetary scale.

Real economic "inclusiveness" is a myth when globally stratified classes are baked into the system's structural core. While a tiny elite enjoys unprecedented wealth and piles on unimaginable riches, the flip side is masses of workers rendered economically superfluous through automation, outsourcing, and a "race to the bottom" in the global labor arbitrage.

Even in wealthy nations, the prospect of "decent work" has been eroded to a mirage for a growing underclass. The much-hyped U.S. "gig economy" ushered in by the likes of Uber and Lyft offers "employment" without meaningful worker protections, benefits, or security. Here too the promise of economic progress is a cruel lie as billions get boxed into precarious, poverty-level contingency work.

For SDG 8 to have any chance of being realized, radical systemic change disrupting the global capitalist order will be required. Perhaps an international maximum wage and corporate profit limits, coupled with aggressive wealth redistribution and empowerment of organized labor. Maybe a unconditional universal basic income as productivity scales and jobs become obsolete. 

One thing is certain: tinkering around the edges while wealthy nation-states and corporations retain their iron-grip on the global economy will only preserve the status quo of deeply embedded worker exploitation. SDG 8's high ideals remain shamefully incompatible with the ruthlessly subjugating economic paradigm.
