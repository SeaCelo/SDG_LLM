Here is a detailed, comprehensive academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 8, written from the perspective of Maureen Dowd:

Decent Work and Economic Growth: A Tragicomedy of Squandered Potential

By Maureen Dowd

Let's talk about SDG 8, the one focused on promoting "sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all." It's a laudable goal, no doubt - who could be against creating quality jobs that lift people out of poverty while bolstering the economy? Yet like so many well-intentioned initiatives, SDG 8 has been plagued by dashed hopes, missed marks, and disheartening shortcomings that underscore the yawning gap between aspiration and action.

As we approach the 2030 target date, the stark reality is that the world remains off-track to achieve this goal in any meaningful way. Far from experiencing robust economic growth that benefits all segments of society, we are confronted with ever-widening inequality, persistent labor rights violations, rampant gender discrimination, and an alarming rise in modern slavery and child exploitation. The cruel paradox is that the global economy continues expanding, yet the gains accrue disproportionately to a privileged few while legions toil in substandard conditions devoid of dignity or security.

Let's examine the grim scoreboard: An estimated 700 million workers lived in extreme or moderate poverty in 2018, their labor yielding paltry returns in a mockery of the "decent work" ideal. Over 60% lacked basic labor protections like minimum wages or mandated paid leave. Youth were over three times more likely to be unemployed compared to adults. And women continued bearing the brunt, comprising a staggering two-thirds of the global minimum wage workforce. So much for leaving no one behind.  

Equally disturbing is the fate of our planet's most vulnerable - children forced into backbreaking labor due to economic desperation. An estimated 152 million children are still engaged in child labor, 73 million of them in hazardous work that directly endangers their health, safety and moral development. For these innocents, dreams of education and opportunity are crushed under the weight of exploitation permitted by lax enforcement and moral cowardice.  

One cannot help but look askance at the gauzy rhetoric around SDG 8 in light of such manifest failings. The international community patted itself on the back for achieving "unprecedented" economic growth prior to the pandemic, crowing about a 9% increase in real GDP for developing countries between 2000-2019. Yet this alleged success story willfully ignores the cancerous growth of the informal economy - a seething underbelly comprising over 60% of global employment, mired in precarious jobs with substandard wages and zero protections. So forgive me for not breaking out the champagne over trickle-down statistical massaging.  

Of course, the COVID-19 crisis laid bare the fragility of this house of cards, obliterating decades of hard-won progress as an estimated 108 million more workers were pushed into poverty. Businesses shuttered en masse, supply chains ruptured, and the gulf between the secure remote worker and their struggling frontline counterpart gaped ever wider. Suddenly the rhetoric around "decent work" rang obscenely hollow for those risking life and limb without hazard pay or protective gear. 

Yet even as the pandemic rages on, corporations remain obsessed with maximizing shareholder returns rather than upholding their obligations to workers and communities. The same companies that gorged on bailouts and tax cuts enthusiastically offshore jobs, lobby against minimum wage hikes, and fight any attempt at unionization tooth and nail. Their mantra - profit Ã¼ber alles - makes a mockery of the "sustainable economic growth" purportedly at SDG 8's core.  

Lest we forget, the bitter seed of obscene wealth disparity was planted long before this viral scourge. From 1990-2015, despite the global workforce expanding by over 50%, the share of GDP funneled to workers shrank from 57% to 51%. Meanwhile, the top 1% quietly amassed over a quarter of total income growth. So much for inclusion and equity being drivers of economic dynamism. Instead, we have a perverse paradox where ballooning inequality coexists with anemic productivity and depressed investment. 

This economic Ponzi scheme is doomed to collapse under its own unsustainable weight. We cannot simply "grow" our way out of this profound structural imbalance, somehow magically attaining the decent work utopia through the same extractive, exploitative models that birthed the crisis to begin with. No, a new paradigm is required - one focused squarely on worker empowerment, aggressive enforcement of robust labor standards, investment in sustainable industries and technology, and an unwavering commitment to equity and social protection as the bedrock of economic resilience.

Economists and policymakers who double down on debunked trickle-down schemes while defending corporate hegemony are akin to tinkerers aboard the Titanic, blithely rearranging the deck chairs as the ship founders.  For SDG 8 to have any credibility, the status quo must be upended through muscular interventions addressing institutionalized biases, unleashing entrepreneurship from the bottom-up, and defanging the rapacious monopolistic forces that have so neutered competition and worker bargaining power.

Skeptics may howl that such a radical overhaul is economically ruinous. I counter it is ruinous to preserve a race-to-the-bottom system so manifestly eroding the shared prosperity and human dignity it claims to cultivate. The trillions squandered on corporate bailouts and tax giveaways offer a budgetary roadmap for prioritizing equitable resets if we can summon the moral fortitude.  

This is not some utopian socialist pipe dream, but an existential mandate. If the bitter desolation and despair wrought by the pandemic has taught us anything, it is that the flawed precepts of our economic orthodoxy are depressingly bankrupt. Continuing to genuflect at the altar of unchecked greed in pursuit of illusive trickle-down miracles is the real fantasy, one destined to immiserate billions more if left unaddressed.

So let's be done with the bromides and contortionist metrics that let comfortable elites declare "mission accomplished" on SDG 8 while the masses toil in purgatory. For the goal's lofty rhetoric to have any validity, the powerful must tangibly dismantle systemic barriers to decent work and equitable spoils. Enough incremental tweaks and self-congratulation as the needless suffering mounts. Achieve SDG 8 or own the pathetic failure - there is no threadbare middle ground left to hide behind.
