Promoting Inclusive and Sustainable Economic Growth through SDG 8: An Intergenerational Perspective

By Asli Demirguc-Kunt

The Sustainable Development Goal 8 (SDG 8) serves as a clarion call for countries worldwide to foster sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all. As we grapple with the far-reaching implications of the COVID-19 pandemic, achieving this goal has become more critical than ever before. The pandemic has exacerbated existing inequalities and imperiled the livelihoods of millions, underscoring the urgency of implementing SDG 8 through a comprehensive and intergenerational approach.

At the heart of SDG 8 lies the recognition that economic growth alone is insufficient; it must be accompanied by equitable and sustainable policies that promote decent work, entrepreneurship, and the formalization of the informal economy. This necessitates a fundamental shift in our understanding of development, one that transcends the narrow confines of GDP and embraces a more holistic vision of human well-being.

To achieve this ambitious goal, we must address the multifaceted challenges faced by both the current and future generations. The youth, who represent the future workforce, face significant barriers to entry into the labor market, including limited access to quality education, skills mismatch, and a dearth of employment opportunities. Simultaneously, we must ensure that the aging population can continue to contribute to and benefit from economic growth through lifelong learning, flexible work arrangements, and robust social protection systems.

Fostering an enabling environment for entrepreneurship and innovation is paramount to driving sustainable economic growth. This requires a concerted effort to remove regulatory barriers, improve access to finance, and promote knowledge transfer and technological adoption, particularly in developing economies. Furthermore, we must prioritize the transition from the informal to the formal economy, which not only enhances productivity and worker protections but also generates much-needed revenue for public investments in infrastructure, education, and healthcare.

Crucially, SDG 8 cannot be achieved in isolation; it is inextricably linked to other SDGs, such as quality education (SDG 4), gender equality (SDG 5), and decent work and economic growth (SDG 8). Investing in quality education and skills development is essential for equipping the workforce with the knowledge and competencies required in the rapidly evolving labor market. Promoting gender equality and empowering women in the workforce can unleash untapped economic potential and drive inclusive growth.

Furthermore, the pursuit of SDG 8 must be underpinned by a commitment to environmental sustainability. Economic growth must be delinked from resource depletion and ecological degradation, necessitating a transition towards green and circular economies. This paradigm shift presents numerous opportunities for innovation, job creation, and the development of new industries focused on renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, and waste management.

As we navigate the complexities of SDG 8, it is imperative to foster international cooperation, knowledge sharing, and the dissemination of best practices. Developed nations must support developing countries through financial and technical assistance, technology transfer, and capacity-building initiatives. Simultaneously, public-private partnerships and multi-stakeholder collaborations must be leveraged to mobilize resources, pool expertise, and drive innovation.

In conclusion, achieving SDG 8 requires a holistic and intergenerational approach that addresses the needs and aspirations of both current and future generations. It demands a fundamental rethinking of our economic models, prioritizing inclusive and sustainable growth, decent work, entrepreneurship, and environmental stewardship. By embracing this transformative vision, we can create a more prosperous, equitable, and resilient world for all.
