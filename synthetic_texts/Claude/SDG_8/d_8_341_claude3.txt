As the Palestinian International Cooperation Agency, we present this analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 8 (SDG 8): Promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all.

The complex and protracted conflict in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT) has profoundly impacted the economic landscape, posing significant challenges to achieving SDG 8. The restrictions on movement, access to resources, and trade have hindered the growth and development of the Palestinian economy, leading to high unemployment rates, particularly among youth and women.

The labor market in the OPT is characterized by a lack of decent work opportunities, with a large portion of the workforce engaged in low-paying, precarious, and informal employment. This is exacerbated by the Israeli-imposed restrictions on access to natural resources, such as land and water, which limit the potential for sustainable economic activities, especially in the agricultural and industrial sectors.

Moreover, the ongoing construction of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the blockade on the Gaza Strip have fragmented the Palestinian economy, disrupting supply chains, and hindering the free flow of goods and services. This has further undermined economic growth and job creation, perpetuating a cycle of poverty and dependence on external aid.

Addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach that tackles the root causes of economic stagnation and promotes inclusive and sustainable growth. This includes advocating for the lifting of movement and access restrictions, promoting Palestinian sovereignty over natural resources, and supporting the development of a diversified and competitive private sector.

One promising avenue is the development of the information and communication technology (ICT) sector, which has shown resilience and growth potential despite the challenging circumstances. Investing in this sector can create high-value employment opportunities, particularly for the educated youth, while also positioning the Palestinian economy for the digital age.

Additionally, strengthening the agricultural sector through sustainable practices and value-added processing can contribute to food security, rural development, and the creation of decent jobs. This can be achieved through investments in infrastructure, technology transfer, and capacity building for smallholder farmers and agribusinesses.

Furthermore, promoting inclusive and gender-responsive policies is crucial to ensure that economic growth benefits all segments of society. This includes supporting women's economic empowerment through access to finance, skills development, and the removal of legal and cultural barriers to their participation in the workforce.

Collaboration with the international community and the private sector is essential to mobilize the necessary resources and expertise for sustainable economic development. This includes fostering an enabling environment for foreign direct investment, facilitating access to international markets, and leveraging public-private partnerships to address infrastructure gaps and promote entrepreneurship.

Ultimately, achieving SDG 8 in the OPT requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the political, economic, and social dimensions of the conflict. Sustainable and inclusive economic growth can only be achieved through a just and lasting resolution that restores Palestinian rights and sovereignty, enabling the full realization of the Palestinian people's economic potential and their right to development.
