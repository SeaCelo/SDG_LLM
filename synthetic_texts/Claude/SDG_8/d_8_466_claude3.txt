Here is a detailed newspaper article about Sustainable Development Goal 8, from the perspective of Consumers Digest magazine:

Working for a Decent and Productive Future 

As consumers, we often focus on the products and services that make our lives more convenient, comfortable, and enjoyable. But the worker behind every transaction is just as important as the items we purchase. Sustainable Development Goal 8 from the United Nations calls for "promoting sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all." This lofty ambition deserves our attention and support.  

Far too many workers around the world are trapped in cycles of poverty, exploitation, unsafe conditions, and human rights abuses. An estimated 630 million workers were living in extreme or moderate poverty in 2018, with millions more lacking basic protections and dignity. The global unemployment rate hovers stubbornly around 5%, with young people hit especially hard at 13%. Adding insult to injury, nearly one-quarter of all employed people were categorized as "working poor" prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.  

As consumers, we may feel disconnected from these sobering realities when goods and services are just a click or storefront away. But our buying power is directly tied to the circumstances of workers who cultivate raw materials, assemble products, stock warehouses and shelves, and ring up our purchases. Every transaction connects us to their well-being.  

SDG 8 charts an ethical and pragmatic path forward. When workers are paid fairly, given safe conditions and equal opportunities, and free from coercion and discrimination, the benefits extend to all. Productivity rises. New markets are cultivated. National incomes grow. Societies stabilize. Purchasing power expands. Innovation flourishes. In short, all of us as consumers gain alongside workers and their families.

Consider the global supply chains that undergird everything we consume. From apparel to smartphones, agricultural products to furniture, manufacturing to mining, decent work deficits exist at multiple points from origin to sale. Implementing SDG 8 targets could transform these chains through collective efforts by governments, companies, workers, and consumers.  

For instance, creating quality jobs with proper labor rights along with environmentally sustainable practices would help diminish the lure of abusive forms of employment like debt bondage and human trafficking. Gender equality and non-discrimination standards would empower marginalized groups while expanding the skilled workforce. Formalizing informal employment through legal statutes and incentives injects fairness, stability, and accountability into shadow economies.  

By exercising our consumer influence, we can steer companies toward ethical employment policies and procurement methods that uphold fair labor standards. We can support companies and industries allied with SDG 8's vision. We can voice concerns through advocacy, activism, and shareholder engagement. We can study product origins and supply chains, choosing brands that value decent work.  

Sustainability certifications, fair trade labels, and other responsible sourcing programs are vital tools for conscious consumerism. But to be truly effective, they require our financial backing and participation to grow in scale and impact.  We as conscientious consumers must be willing to pay fair prices and adjust our purchasing habits to make decent work a global norm.

Even with the turbulence of recent times, there is progress to celebrate. Youth employment is recovering faster than in previous crises. The middle class grew by 180 million from 2008-2015 in developing countries, before COVID-19 setbacks. Labor productivity continues rising while poverty rates decline. Consumers are becoming more discerning and empowered to drive change through ethical spending.   

So let's embrace our collective stake in SDG 8. Beyond safeguarding the human rights and dignity of workers everywhere, decent work catalyzes economic opportunity and prosperity that benefits us all as consumers. We have the power and motivation to reward companies that create quality jobs. To borrow the mantra of labor rights advocates: An injury to one is an injury to all. Conversely, decent work is a rising tide lifting every boat.
