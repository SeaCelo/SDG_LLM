The Italian Development Cooperation Programme recognizes the pivotal role of SDG 8 – Decent Work and Economic Growth – in fostering sustainable and inclusive development. As a nation committed to promoting equitable prosperity, Italy's foreign policy initiatives prioritize the creation of decent employment opportunities, sustainable economic growth, and the advancement of rights at work.

At the core of our approach lies the recognition that decent work is not merely a byproduct of economic growth but a vital driver and enabler of sustainable development. We acknowledge the multidimensional nature of this goal, encompassing not only the creation of jobs but also the quality and conditions of employment, the protection of worker rights, and the promotion of an enabling environment for entrepreneurship and innovation.

Italy's development cooperation efforts in this domain are guided by a comprehensive strategy that addresses the interconnected challenges of unemployment, underemployment, and informal employment. We collaborate closely with partner countries to strengthen their institutional frameworks, enhance labor market governance, and foster an enabling environment for sustainable enterprises.

A key focus area is the promotion of youth employment and entrepreneurship. We recognize the transformative potential of young people as agents of change and the imperative of providing them with opportunities for skill development, productive employment, and economic empowerment. Through targeted initiatives, we support vocational training programs, entrepreneurship incubators, and access to finance for youth-led enterprises, fostering an ecosystem that nurtures innovation and job creation.

Furthermore, our development cooperation efforts place significant emphasis on gender equality and the economic empowerment of women. We work to dismantle structural barriers, challenge discriminatory social norms, and promote equal opportunities for women in the labor market. This includes supporting initiatives that enhance women's access to education, skills training, and productive resources, as well as fostering an enabling environment for women-owned businesses and inclusive workplace policies.

Recognizing the significance of the informal economy, Italy's development cooperation program also addresses the challenges faced by workers in this sector. We support the transition to formalization by promoting policies that extend social protection, ensure decent working conditions, and facilitate the integration of informal workers into the formal economy.

Moreover, our efforts extend to promoting sustainable tourism as a driver of inclusive economic growth. We collaborate with partner countries to develop sustainable tourism strategies, enhance local capacities, and foster linkages between the tourism sector and local communities, thereby generating decent employment opportunities and promoting the preservation of cultural and natural heritage.

In line with the principles of policy coherence for sustainable development, Italy's development cooperation program also addresses the broader enabling environment for sustainable economic growth. This includes supporting initiatives that promote responsible investment practices, foster sustainable industrialization, and encourage the adoption of clean and resource-efficient technologies.

Through our multi-stakeholder partnerships and collaborations with international organizations, civil society, and the private sector, we strive to ensure that our efforts are aligned with global best practices and contribute to the achievement of the SDGs at both national and international levels.

By fostering an environment conducive to decent work, promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth, and upholding the rights and dignity of workers, Italy's development cooperation program aims to create a virtuous cycle of prosperity, social progress, and environmental sustainability – a vision that lies at the heart of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
