Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth, written from the perspective of George Will:

The Indispensable Pursuit of Economic Dynamism and Human Dignity

By George Will

In the pursuit of equitable and sustainable global development, few objectives are as fundamental yet complex as ensuring decent work and robust economic growth for all people and nations. Sustainable Development Goal 8 represents an acknowledgment that economic vibrancy and respect for human labor are intertwined with nearly every other priority – eradicating poverty, achieving food security, promoting healthy lives, quality education, and environmental sustainability. Without stable employment opportunities and an economic framework that incentivizes innovation while upholding worker protections, the entire edifice of human advancement begins to teeter.

The imperative of SDG 8 beckons us to consider the intricate interplay between a nation's economic policies and the tangible quality of life for its citizenry. Robust GDP growth untempered by equitable wealth distribution and workplace safeguards does little to better the human condition. Similarly, an abundance of make-work jobs devoid of upward mobility and dignified conditions is but a materialistic salve that fails to unleash the dynamism of human potential. True economic progress must harmonize quantitative growth with the immutable virtues of individual liberty, entrepreneurial zeal, and a transcendent sense of human dignity derived through productive labor.

To pragmatically assess global progress on SDG 8, we must soberly survey the employment landscape across both developed and developing economies. Even as globalization and technological automation have expanded economic output, have these tectonic shifts afforded an adequate supply of opportunities and job security for all strata of society? Are national policies fostering environments conducive to grassroots entrepreneurship and labor force participation, particularly among historically underrepresented groups? Do mechanisms exist to formalize and safeguard informal sector employment? And perhaps most critically, are workers granted the fundamental rights, protections, and voice necessary to fortify their intrinsic human dignity?    

The economic stratification and employment volatility plaguing many mature free market economies should serve as a flashing warning signal. The withering of traditional labor force pathways, precarious wage stagnation, and yawning inequalities in opportunity and working conditions have nourished the insidious rise of angst-ridden populism on both extremes of the ideological spectrum. If capitalism is to remain credible as an uplifting force, it must restore its moral legitimacy by radically reinvigorating the link between hard work, economic mobility, and human flourishing.  

For developing nations, the challenges in satisfying SDG 8 are equally daunting yet existential for billions mired in destitution. Achieving sustainable economic growth and employment generation at the pace and scale required will necessitate bold national development strategies, robust private sector growth, strategic investments in human capital and infrastructure, and wholesale reductions in burdensome regulatory barriers, corruption, and macroeconomic instability. Alleviating arduous working conditions, insufficient labor protections, and obstructive cultural impediments that repress the economic inclusion of women and minority groups must be prioritized.

Indeed, the path to fulfilling the ambition of SDG 8 traverses challenging terrain laden with entrenched impediments. However, humanity's moral imagination and commercial ingenuity have consistently proven catalytic in overcoming intractable quandaries once sufficient intellectual resources, economic incentives, and ethical determination are marshalled. If the universal aspiration of dignified work in the service of human flourishing is elevated as a preeminent global priority imbued with philosophical heft and economic urgency, the eventual attainment of SDG 8 can serve as an inspirational harbinger of humanity's capacity for reinvention and moral renewal.

The stakes could not be higher. For it is through the perpetual wellspring of decent work and economic dynamism that the foundational pillars of human development are fortified – the elemental struggle against privation, the catalytic spark of innovation, the impartation of purpose and self-actualization, the diffusion of democratic norms, and the bulwark against despair and social unrest. In this multi-generational endeavor resides the enduring honor of constructing an economic order no longer an affront to human dignity, but its modern vindication.
