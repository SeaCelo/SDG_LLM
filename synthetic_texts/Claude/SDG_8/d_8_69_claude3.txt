Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), written from the perspective of journalist Heather Mallick:

The Hollow Promise of 'Decent Work' Under Capitalism

By Heather Mallick

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 8 calls for "promoting sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all." On the surface, this admirable if broad objective seems innocuous enough. But a deeper examination reveals how thoroughly this aim is undermined by the inherent contradictions and exploitations of the capitalist system.

Let's start with the very concept of "decent work." What constitutes decency is subjective, but any reasonable interpretation would include fair wages, safe working conditions, reasonable hours, job security, and freedom from discrimination, harassment or abuse. Yet the profit motive that drives capitalism is fundamentally at odds with this notion of decent work.

For capital to perpetually expand and generate returns for the ownership class, the costs of labour must be suppressed through myriad tactics - loopholes enabling inadequate minimum wages, lax enforcement of labour laws, undermining unions, exploiting immigrant workers, offshoring to locales with fewer protections, and so on. Even in wealthy nations, the gig economy is premised on stripping away decent work standards by reclassifying employees as precariously-employed contractors.

The existential threat of automation to human labour upholds capitalism's ethos that workers are disposable inputs to be optimized, not stakeholders with rights or voices. Those remaining jobs deemed un-automatable will likely entrench a new underclass of thankless drudgery - the precise antithesis of decent work.

So while the rhetoric around decent work is appeasingly hunky-dory, the brutality of market forces ensures its sabotage. As long as the dictatorship of capital reigns supreme, the incentive to undermine work decency for perpetual private enrichment will corrode any ethical economic model.

The SDG's inclusion of "sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth" presents another inherent tension. Our current growth paradigm is fundamentally predicated on over-exploitation of finite natural resources, degradation of ecosystems, and carbon-intensive production - the very opposite of sustainability. Endless growth is simply incompatible with the planet's ecological limits.

Furthermore, much of modern growth is financialized rather than productive - a pseudo-catalyst of asset inflation like real estate and stocks rather than growth rooted in the real economy improving human welfare. Capital's rentier behavior enriches the elite while stagnating wages and living standards.

Even if we achieve an economic growth spurt, its fruits will inadequately trickle down. Most gains inevitably concentrate in the hands of corporations and the ultra-wealthy - the very forces distorting market dynamics to subvert decent work in the first place.  

Look no further than the perverse imbalance of corporations celebrating record profits margins amid rampant inflation while suppressing wages and busting unions. Unfettered, growth only intensifies capital's dominance while producing little tangible benefit for the masses.

So SDG 8's intertwining of decent work and growth remains fundamentally paradoxical under capitalism. You cannot ethically reconcile labour rights and sustainability with a system predicated on their repression. This is why a more holistic, democratic restructuring of our economic model is imperative.

Whether exploring stakeholder theory, the co-operative movement, or more transformative ecosocialist visions - any credible path forward must dismantle capital's stranglehold over economic priorities. Only then can we break this vicious cycle of profiting from indecent work and unsustainable overconsumption.

Without such systemic economic reform, SDG 8 will remain an empty slogan. Fine words buttressing the status quo rather than catalyzing authentic equity and sustainability. A neoliberal Trojan horse rebranding marginalization as "decent" and ecocide as "growth." Until we interrogate root causes, the goal of dignified livelihoods for all will stay fiendishly out of reach.
