Here is a long academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), written from the perspective of bestselling author Chetan Bhagat:

What's up guys? In this piece, I want to take you through a heavy but crucial topic - economic growth and the future of work. Now, I know what some of you are thinking - 'Chetan bhai, why are you writing about this boring development stuff? Give us some light-hearted romance na!' Bear with me though, this is important. 

See, the way I look at it, sustainable economic growth that creates decent jobs is absolutely vital for the world, especially for a country like India with its huge youth population. Without opportunities to earn a living with dignity, how can families and societies truly prosper? It's one of the biggest challenges we face.

The core of SDG 8 is promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all. Those are pretty lofty goals, I'll admit. But if we don't aim high, we'll never get anywhere, right?

Let me start with the employment situation. The hard truth is that globally, labor force participation rates for women remain stubbornly low compared to males. Here in India, less than a quarter of women are working or actively looking for a job. That's just wrong on so many levels - denying women the chance to be financially independent and achieve their full potential. We simply have to do better.  

Then there's the issue of vulnerable and informal employment, which a huge chunk of India's workforce is trapped in. I'm talking about jobs with poor pay, little stability or social protection. How can families build any kind of secure future like that? We need to create more opportunities in the formal sector, with proper worker rights, safety standards and scope for growth.  

Of course, economic growth alone isn't enough if it's not inclusive and sustainable. We've seen how unbridled growth focused only on money has damaged the environment and excluded the poor from its benefits. That model is completely broken in today's world.  

What we need now is smart policies and initiatives that link economic progress to reducing inequalities, empowering disadvantaged groups, fostering innovation and protecting the planet's resources. It's all interconnected - you can't have one without the other in the long run.

Some key areas we should look at? Boosting youth employment through quality education and skills. Enabling entrepreneurship and growth of MSMEs with better access to finance and markets. Improving rural incomes and value addition in agriculture. Investing in sustainable infrastructure and industrialization that is green and resilient. 

Technology and digitalization can be great enablers across sectors if embraced properly. But we also have to manage issues like potential job disruptions due to automation. Maybe exploring concepts like universal basic income could help?

Look, I don't have all the answers. But I do know that what happens with SDG 8 will pretty much make or break our collective future. Creating a world with decent work opportunities for everyone is absolutely vital for human development and sustainable progress. It's non-negotiable in my books.

So, to all you young people out there - your dreams, ambitions and hard work will be the driving force. Don't settle for anything less than ethical, productive employment that lets you live life with dignity. 

And to the policy makers and leaders - the youth of today are your future workforce and customer base. Prioritize their skills, jobs and entrepreneurial aspirations if you want long-term national prosperity. No more short-term thinking, khali jumlas or PR stunts. It's time to walk the talk with strategic vision and committed action.

I know this was a heavy one. But like I said, this goal is too important for any of us to ignore if we care about an equal, just and sustainable world for all. Let's get to work!
