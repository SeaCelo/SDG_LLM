Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), written from the perspective of Peter Hitchens:

The relentless pursuit of economic growth as an overarching objective has been one of the great follies of modern times. The obsessive corporatism and materialism that fuels this misguided ambition corrodes societal values, erodes traditional communities, and threatens the very foundations of civilized life. Sustainable Development Goal 8, with its myopic focus on "promoting sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all," epitomizes everything that has gone awry with the modern secular religion of forced progress at all costs.

The very concept of endlessly chasing "economic growth" as a panacea is fundamentally flawed. It is an abstract numerical conquest devoid of deeper meaning or purpose beyond its own perpetuation. This crusade pays no heed to finite resources, environmental devastation, cultural dissolution, or the inherent human need for permanence and roots. Its foot soldiers in the corporate world engage in ceaseless downsizing, offshoring, and labor arbitrage in pursuit of ever-higher shareholder returns and executive bonuses. The inevitable result is rampant instability - disrupted communities, broken families, corrosion of craftsmanship and pride in one's work.

Even the touted objective of "full and productive employment" is a mirage. For a small minority it means cubicle-dwelling drudgery and incessant career anxiety, punctuated by bouts of retraining to become grist for the next round of disruptive innovation. For the restless global reserve army of servant labor, it means lives of ceaseless toil in a race to the bottom, stripping back generations of hard-won protections to compete for insecure, subsistence wages. Those left behind face demoralization, vice, and societal decay.  

As for "decent work for all," this utopian fantasy could scarcely be further from reality. Even in wealthy nations, once-prestigious vocations have been deskilled, devalued, and reduced to mere inputs for a hungry, churning service sector machine. The notions of permanence, mastery of craft, workplace dignity, and communities of skilled tradespeople sustaining themselves through honest labor have been laid to waste on the altar of flexible, disposable labor. Abroad, billions toil under harrowing conditions in a vast nether region of offshored, outsourced drudgery supporting the illusion of Western affluence.

The true path to societal health and sustainable human development lies not in perpetual disruption, growth mania, and dehumanizing labor inputs. Rather, it can be found in the revival of stable communities, reverence for the permanence of the land and its ecology, rediscovery of the spiritual moorings that guide humanity's place in the world, and a return to the honored crafts, trades, and vocations that have long formed the bedrock of civilization. Economic activity would flow from this rooted way of life as a stable, sustainable stream - not a fetishized endless growth imperative that lays waste to all it touches.

We would do well to abandon SDG 8 and reconsider a development model rooted in human civilization's deeper foundations. Only then can we hope to restore sanity, stability, and purpose to how we truly sustain our societies over centuries and millennia. The perpetual disruption and corporate-driven mania of the present path leads only to individual alienation, civilizational ruin, and despoliation of this blessed and irreplaceable planet we have been charged with preserving.
