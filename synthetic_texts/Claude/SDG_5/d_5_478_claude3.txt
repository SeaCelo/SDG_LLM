Here is a draft newspaper article about Sustainable Development Goal 5 (Gender Equality), as if written for The Wall Street Journal:

Achieving Gender Parity: The $12 Trillion Economic Opportunity
By [Author Name]

The global pursuit of gender equality isn't just a moral imperative â€“ it's also an unparalleled economic opportunity for the 21st century. According to recent analysis by the McKinsey Global Institute, advancing women's equality could add an astounding $12 trillion to the global GDP by 2025. Despite commendable progress, sobering gaps in workplace participation, leadership, wages, and entrepreneurship remain stubbornly entrenched across both developed and developing nations. Unlocking this profound reservoir of human potential is pivotal not just for fundamental fairness, but for catalyzing productivity, innovation, and sustainable economic growth worldwide.  

The $12 trillion prize factors in a "best-in-region" scenario where all countries match the progress towards gender parity of the top performers in their region. In the U.S. and Canada, this could generate over $3.1 trillion in annual GDP gains by achieving gender parity in labor force participation, hours worked, and sector mix. Europe could see over $2.5 trillion boosted by equalizing participation rates. China's GDP impact exceeds $2.6 trillion, while the prospects for India top $770 billion by closing its considerable gender gaps.

Yet these dizzying figures belie the impediments women face globally. While the World Economic Forum's 2022 Global Gender Gap Report shows a marginal improvement in economic participation and opportunity, workplace gender divides remain cavernous. Women's labor force participation trails men's by over 30 percentage points. In the corporate pipeline, women comprise just 37% of lower and mid-level managers and a paltry 27% of vice presidents and higher roles. Stark leadership inequities persist too, with only 27 women leading Fortune 500 firms today.

The chasm is even wider for entrepreneurs eyeing the entrepreneurship economy. Though female-owned businesses flourished during the pandemic, women still face outsize challenges accessing capital, networks, and professional services. According to researchers at Babson College, women launch companies with significantly lower levels of capital - an 83% delta compared to their male peers. They're also less likely to attract external equity financing, stifling rapid scale and growth. As a result, fewer than 5% of women-led startups generate over $1 million in revenue.

Closing these economic fissures is both an ethical and competitive imperative for companies seeking to optimize organizational performance, as numerous studies link gender diversity to stronger financial results, innovation, and decision-making. A study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics evaluated formerly male-focused firms, finding a 15% increase in gross revenue when women joined the C-suite. Similarly, research by the Harvard Business Review revealed public companies with more women attained higher equity valuations.

Corporations are gradually enacting policies to level the playing field. Major companies have ramped up family leave programs, sponsorship initiatives for high-potential women, leadership trainings, and accountability metrics for hiring and promotions. Investors are also amplifying calls for greater diversity through shareholder resolutions and gender lens investing strategies targeting women entrepreneurs. Global commitments like the UN Women's Empowerment Principles provide guideposts too.  

While these measures are encouraging, bolder action is needed from corporations, governments, and society to remove deep-seated barriers and biases and unleash the economic windfall of actualizing SDG 5. Best practices include affordable childcare, pay audits, flexible work arrangements, sponsorship programs, robust anti-harassment policies, and strengthening the pipeline through STEM and leadership training. Dismantling outdated cultural norms marginalizing women's ambitions is paramount too.

The payoffs of prioritizing gender equality extend beyond the bottom line. Greater financial autonomy cultivates agency, empowerment, generational progress, and societal stability. With the bulk of the world's economically excluded being women and girls, redressing these inequities unlocks vast human capital to solve humanity's grandest challenges. Capturing the full economic footprint of aspiring female talent, entrepreneurs, and leaders is this era's greatest opportunity. It's time for the world to embrace this monumental opening - the $12 trillion agenda awaits.
