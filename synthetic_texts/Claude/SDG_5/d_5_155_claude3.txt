Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 5 (Gender Equality) written in the style of Maureen Dowd:

The Glacial Grind Toward Ovarian Overachievement

By Maureen Dowd

Well, ladies, we've been slogging away at this whole gender equality thing for a while now, and the glacial pace is enough to make your ovaries hurt. As we stare down the barrel of 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals that stuffy bunch of UN bureaucrats set out, it's hard not to feel a bit cynical about SDG 5 and its lofty promises of smashing patriarchal paradigms.

I mean, we're talking about a goal that wants to "achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls" in just eight short years. That's a herculean feat that would make even the burliest of feminists break out in a flop sweat. The devil, as always, is in the deeply disappointing details.

Take target 5.1 - eliminating all forms of discrimination against all women and girls everywhere. Everywhere! That's a planet's worth of ingrained biases, entrenched misogyny, and cretinous chauvinists we're dealing with here. It makes you want to pour yourself a big goblet of  whine.

Then there are the pithy sub-targets that read more like sad little poems than actual ambitions. 5.2 wants to eliminate violence and exploitation against ALL women and girls in not just the public spheres but the private spheres too. Has the UN been binging too many Lifetime movies? Injecting the private realm with change is trickier than squeezing a Kardashian into haute couture. 

And don't get me started on 5.4 and its rosy-hued goal of recognizing and valuing unpaid care and domestic work. Hello, have you met the heterosexual married male? He wouldn't know unpaid domestic work if it snuck up and cleaned his oven while he channel-surfed in a Barcalounger. Getting the Y-chromosome crowd to understand, let alone value, the heroic daily grind of women is a bigger longshot than spotting an endangered Siberian tiger grazing in Central Park.

Still, we feminists are a delusionally optimistic bunch, bless our deranged hearts. So we'll keep grinding away at these SDGs, mustering all our ovarian fortitude, trying to chip away at that thick-as-a-brick glass ceiling one targetminisculely at a time. With any luck, alien anthropologists studying the extinctremnants of humanity thousands of years from now will at least be able to say, "Well, those women gave the old college try at equality before their species spontaneously combusted in a fiery ball of misogyny and climate change."

It's the little things that keep hope alive, you know? Like knowing the moldering bones of those UN paper-pushers deep in their Feminist Utopia fever dream will have turned to dust long before true gender parity is achieved. You've got to start compulsive, sarcastic laughing someplace, so why not with that image? It's the only salve for the eternal burn of waiting for the winds of change to sweep away the last strongholds of the phallocratic order.
