Here is a draft academic article on SDG 5 (Gender Equality) as if written by journalist Clarence Page:

Gender (In)Equality: The Unfinished Revolution

By Clarence Page

When the United Nations adopted its Sustainable Development Goals in 2015, gender equality took its rightful place as Goal No. 5, a priority that backers hoped would advance the global movement toward full empowerment of women and girls. Seven years later, the goal remains as unfulfilled as ever.

That's disappointing but not surprising. Achieving true gender parity has eluded every culture and society across history, even those that loudly profess their commitment to it. Nations rich and poor struggle with the same stubborn cultural norms and institutional barriers that impede women's progress toward equal rights and opportunities.

In my home country, the United States, women have come a long way since the feminist movement powered through suffrage, workplace equality, and reproductive rights over the past century. Yet huge gender gaps persist in wages, corporate leadership, political power, and vulnerability to sexual harassment, abuse and violence.

Globally, while some nations have made great strides in education and workforce participation, others brutally subjugate women through law and custom. Rampant sex trafficking, forced marriages, and lack of reproductive rights, from sub-Saharan Africa to the Arab world, treat countless women and girls as property.

Even in prosperous Europe, women face a Sisyphean task of pushing that eternal boulder uphill against entrenched patriarchal attitudes. A recent United Nations report found the COVID pandemic has set back hard-won progress for women across multiple indicators — a grim reminder of how fragile those gains can be.

Fundamentally, the equality revolution remains unfinished because it requires a wrenching cultural transformation — an overhaul of our most deeply rooted ideas about gender, power, sexuality and established ways of life. Like the shifts required by other human rights movements, that's the sort of sea change that inevitably meets ferocious backlash by threatened patriarchal forces, whether political, religious or social.

It reminds me of the clergyman's Biblical proverb: A patient man has great understanding, but a quick-tempered man displays folly. Upending traditional gender roles inspires furious reactions by men who feel their birthright to dominance is under assault. Thus we see rises in misogynistic rhetoric, domestic violence, and other oppositional forces whenever women demand their equal rights.

This backlash can feel disheartening, even hopeless, to advocates for change. But it should also be seen as a positive indicator that the movement for gender equality has made its mark and cannot easily be turned back. Social transformations of this magnitude are never linear, always tumultuous affairs marked by zigs, zags, and painful setbacks.

We have far to go, but we must continue. The arguments for gender equity are not mere philosophical musings but rooted in pragmatic necessity. Study after study shows education and prosperity rise in societies that empower women and girls. Peace and stability follow. Oppression breeds poverty, conflict, and societal dysfunction.

As a pragmatist who values outcomes over rhetoric, I choose to be optimistic that the arc of progress bends toward greater equality over time. Generational change, through activism and education, gradually replaces old prejudices with new inclusive norms.  

We should celebrate milestones like the US and other nations achieving gender parity in employment. But we must also confront harsh truths, like the United Nations finding gender-based discrimination is now as pervasive today as it was 25 years ago.

Let that sober realization inspire us to redouble our efforts toward the Sustainable Development Goal of full, irreversible gender equality for all. It will require dismantling not just regressive policies but the ossified cultural attitudes that nourish oppression. 

That is a tall order, but a worthy objective essential to human progress. After all, as the African proverb says, "Until the lions have their own historians, the hunter will always be a hero." The equality revolution remains unfinished until all voices are heard.
