Expertise France has undertaken a rigorous assessment of the progress and challenges surrounding Sustainable Development Goal 5 (SDG 5), which aims to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. Our findings reveal a complex and multifaceted landscape, where progress has been uneven across regions, socioeconomic strata, and diverse cultural contexts.

Despite significant strides in legal and policy frameworks, structural barriers persist, perpetuating gender-based discrimination and hindering the full realization of women's rights. Deeply entrenched patriarchal norms and gender stereotypes continue to undermine women's agency, limiting their participation in decision-making processes and access to economic opportunities. In many contexts, women's disproportionate burden of unpaid care and domestic labor constrains their ability to engage in productive activities, further exacerbating inequalities.

The intersectionality of gender with other social stratifiers, such as race, ethnicity, disability, and socioeconomic status, compounds the challenges faced by marginalized groups of women and girls. Indigenous women, for instance, often confront multiple layers of discrimination, limiting their access to essential services, including healthcare and education. Refugee and internally displaced women are particularly vulnerable, facing heightened risks of gender-based violence, exploitation, and trafficking.

The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing gender inequalities, with women bearing the brunt of the socioeconomic impacts. Losses in employment, increased care burdens, and disruptions in essential services have disproportionately affected women, reversing hard-won gains and threatening to derail progress towards SDG 5.

Despite these challenges, there are pockets of progress and promising practices that offer valuable lessons. In Rwanda, for example, a concerted effort to promote women's political participation has led to a remarkable representation of women in parliament, surpassing the global average. Similarly, initiatives such as conditional cash transfers and micro-finance programs have empowered women economically in countries like Mexico and Bangladesh.

To accelerate progress towards SDG 5, a multidimensional and intersectional approach is crucial. Transformative policies and programs must address the root causes of gender inequality, including harmful social norms, discriminatory laws, and unequal access to resources. Investments in quality education, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), are essential to equip girls and young women with the skills and confidence to participate in emerging sectors.

Enhancing women's access to productive resources, such as land, finance, and technology, can unlock their economic potential and promote inclusive growth. Concurrently, efforts must be made to recognize, reduce, and redistribute unpaid care work, enabling women to engage in paid employment and entrepreneurial activities.

Ensuring women's meaningful participation in decision-making processes at all levels is paramount, not only as a matter of rights but also as a catalyst for sustainable development. Women's perspectives and experiences must be integrated into policy formulation, implementation, and monitoring mechanisms to ensure that interventions are responsive to their needs and priorities.

Effective implementation of SDG 5 requires a whole-of-society approach, involving governments, civil society organizations, the private sector, and international development partners. Strengthening institutional capacities, fostering multi-stakeholder partnerships, and leveraging innovative financing mechanisms are essential to mobilize resources and sustain progress.

In conclusion, achieving gender equality and empowering women and girls is not only a moral imperative but also a critical driver of sustainable development. By addressing the structural barriers and intersectional challenges that impede women's full participation, we can unlock their transformative potential and accelerate progress towards a more just, equitable, and prosperous world.
