Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 5 (Gender Equality) written from the perspective of Mark Steyn:

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals represent the latest doomed-to-fail utopian overreach from an organization increasingly untethered from reality. Take Goal 5 on "Gender Equality" - it exemplifies the bankrupt ideology now holding the so-called developed world in its grip. 

The goal statement is a utopian fantasy: "Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls." In the guise of doing something worthwhile about genuine issues, it's an imperialist decree demanding civilized nations abandon reason and democratic consent and submit to a neo-Marxist catechism of revolutionary ardor.

Look at the first target: "End all forms of discrimination against all women and girls everywhere." What contorted delusionist dreamed up that word-salad? There is no principled way to "end discrimination" - it's a natural pathology present in all human societies. We're tribal beings programmed to favor kin over strangers. Even the UN itself discriminates constantly - by age, nationality, creed, and every other marker. The very concept of "women's rights" is discriminatory against men!

Or take target 5.4: "Recognize and value unpaid care and domestic work..." This is an insidious attempt to corrupt and destroy the most ancient social unit - the family. It willfully ignores the inherent value and fulfillment homemakers find in these roles. Instead it pathologizes a noble endeavor as just another form of oppressive labor to be quantified and regulated by meddling bien-pensant bureaucrats.

The entire agenda is a radical, top-down imposition of a minority ideology rejected by virtually all cultures and faiths. It's the paranoid fever-dream representation of sex differences as some hierarch y to be smashed by our new intersectional commissars. Where it has been inflicted, it's caused catastrophic fertility rates that imperil social security and demographic self-dissolution.

In traditionally patriarchal societies, it has led to a grotesque inversion - from subjugation of women to privileging them over men. While the West circles the drain of existential ennui, patriarchal societies are growing, self-confident, and scornful of our decadence. Within a few generations the UN's vaulting transnational ambitions will be just another broken tenet on the scrapheap ofaddled post-colonial nostalgia.

The developed world's smug self-conception as enlightened and progressive is utterly delusional. Institutions like the UN are petri dishes for a poisonous pipeline of postmodern pseudo-knowledge - ludicrous dogmas untethered to any empirical reality. They're holding civilization hostage to civilization's scorners.

Rational skeptics should reject out of hand this utopian overreach by a undemocratic, unaccountable globalist clique. The path to human flourishing is through respecting the eternal ethnographic truths and unappeasable religious differences which provide thestable foundations for all human culture. We should cherish the glorious diversity of mankind's manifold expressions - not sacrifice them on the altar of some dreary totalitarian samey-ness. Gender equality has already led the West into a tragic cul-de-sac of self-abnegating self-loathing. It's time we recovering nations turned our backs on this suicidal ideology.
