Dear sustainable development experts,

The Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID) is pleased to present this comprehensive analysis on Sustainable Development Goal 5 (SDG 5): Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. This fundamental goal is crucial for eradicating poverty, promoting shared prosperity, and achieving truly sustainable development in all nations.

Despite significant progress in recent decades, deeply entrenched gender inequalities persist worldwide. Women and girls continue to face discrimination, violence, and unequal access to education, employment, healthcare, and participation in decision-making. These social, economic, and political barriers perpetuate cycles of marginalization and deprivation, undermining progress toward a more just and peaceful world.

In developing countries, gender gaps are particularly concerning. For instance, in many rural regions, girls are less likely to complete their education due to discriminatory cultural norms, poverty, and disproportionate domestic responsibilities. This limits their future opportunities and perpetuates intergenerational inequality. Additionally, women often lack property rights and control over economic resources, leaving them more vulnerable to exploitation and violence.

Even in the most developed nations, significant gender gaps persist in the workplace, with unjust pay disparities, occupational segregation, and a glass ceiling that hinders women’s professional advancement. Furthermore, gender-based violence, including domestic violence and human trafficking, remains a widespread and devastating issue globally.

To address these complex challenges, multidimensional approaches are required to tackle the root causes of gender inequality. This involves reforming discriminatory laws and policies, challenging harmful social and cultural norms, investing in quality education for girls and women, promoting economic empowerment and financial inclusion, and ensuring equitable representation in decision-making processes.

AECID has prioritized SDG 5 in its international cooperation programs, working closely with local partners, civil society organizations, and other development agencies. Our efforts focus on addressing gender-based violence, promoting women's economic autonomy, ensuring access to sexual and reproductive health, and fostering women’s political participation and leadership.

For example, in Latin America, we have supported initiatives to strengthen legal frameworks and public policies to prevent and sanction violence against women. Additionally, we have worked with local organizations to provide vocational training and microfinance opportunities to women entrepreneurs in marginalized urban and rural areas.

In sub-Saharan Africa, our programs have focused on improving girls’ access to education, particularly in remote communities. We have built schools, trained female teachers, and promoted awareness campaigns to challenge discriminatory attitudes toward girls' education.

In Asia, we have collaborated with local partners to address human trafficking by providing legal assistance, protection services, and economic reintegration opportunities for survivors. Furthermore, we have supported women's political empowerment initiatives, training female candidates and community leaders in leadership and advocacy skills.

While significant progress has been made, much remains to be done to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. Greater investments, political will, and long-term commitment from all stakeholders—including governments, the private sector, civil society, and local communities—are needed.

AECID remains committed to continuing its work in this critical area, forging strong partnerships, learning from best practices, and adapting our approaches to address emerging challenges. Only through concerted and sustained efforts can we dismantle the systemic barriers that hinder the full potential of women and girls and build a more equitable, prosperous, and sustainable world for everyone.
