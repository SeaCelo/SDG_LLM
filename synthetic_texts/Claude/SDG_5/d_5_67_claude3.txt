At the dawn of the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals by the United Nations in 2015, gender equality was already at the heart of global priorities. Goal 5, which aims to "achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls," has, however, brought unprecedented momentum to this critical struggle.

Over the years, the progress achieved has been significant but uneven across regions. Systemic gender-based discrimination persists, hindering women's empowerment and jeopardizing the sustainable development of societies. To eradicate these persistent barriers, sustained mobilization at all levels is crucial.

In the home, domestic violence, child marriage, and the disproportionate burden of household chores still hinder women's full potential. In the public sphere, unequal access to education, property, and economic resources perpetuates women's vulnerability. Women's underrepresentation in politics and the denial of fundamental rights further limit their prospects for emancipation.

These multidimensional challenges demand coordinated strategies where civil society, the private sector, and government institutions unite their efforts. Awareness campaigns must tackle harmful patriarchal norms and stereotypes. Women's economic empowerment should be promoted through vocational training, entrepreneurship, and fair fiscal policies. Quotas and gender-responsive budgeting will enhance political representation. Finally, strict enforcement of laws against gender-based violence is imperative.

Beyond practical measures, a profound change in mindsets is required to establish equality as a societal norm. Leaders must lead by example, advocating this cardinal value with conviction and integrityâ€”a cornerstone of a better and more just world for all.
