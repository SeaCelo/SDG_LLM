As the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), we are deeply committed to advancing gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, as outlined in Sustainable Development Goal 5 (SDG 5). Our mandate extends across the regions where we operate, and we recognize the pivotal role that gender equality plays in fostering sustainable economic growth, social cohesion, and overall prosperity.

Drawing upon our extensive experience and research, we have observed a concerning trend: despite progress in certain areas, gender disparities persist across various sectors, hindering the full realization of women's potential and impeding their participation in economic and social spheres. This issue is particularly pronounced in our regions of operation, where deep-rooted cultural norms, discriminatory practices, and institutional barriers continue to disadvantage women and girls.

One area of concern is the persistent gender gap in labor force participation. While women's involvement in the workforce has increased over the years, significant disparities remain. In many countries where we operate, women face greater challenges in accessing employment opportunities, particularly in high-skilled and leadership positions. This gap is exacerbated by factors such as inadequate access to education and training, lack of affordable childcare services, and discriminatory hiring practices.

Furthermore, the prevalence of gender-based violence remains alarmingly high in our regions. This issue not only violates fundamental human rights but also has far-reaching socioeconomic consequences. It undermines women's ability to participate fully in the workforce, impedes their access to education and healthcare, and perpetuates a cycle of marginalization and disempowerment.

Another critical challenge is the underrepresentation of women in decision-making positions, both in the public and private sectors. Despite their significant contributions to economies and societies, women remain largely excluded from positions of power and influence. This lack of representation not only undermines principles of fairness and equity but also deprives organizations and governments of diverse perspectives and innovative solutions.

To address these multifaceted challenges, the EBRD has adopted a comprehensive approach rooted in our commitment to promoting gender equality and women's economic empowerment. Our efforts span various sectors, including access to finance, entrepreneurship support, legal and regulatory reforms, and capacity-building initiatives.

For instance, our Women in Business program has proven highly successful in providing financing, advisory services, and training to women-led small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). By addressing the unique barriers faced by women entrepreneurs, such as limited access to capital and networks, we have enabled countless women to start and grow their businesses, fostering economic independence and contributing to job creation and economic growth.

Additionally, we actively engage with policymakers and stakeholders to promote legal and regulatory reforms that uphold women's rights and create an enabling environment for their participation in economic and social spheres. Our technical assistance and advisory services support the development of inclusive policies, strengthen institutional capacities, and facilitate the implementation of gender-responsive initiatives.

Moreover, we recognize the critical importance of addressing deep-rooted cultural norms and societal attitudes that perpetuate gender stereotypes and discrimination. Through strategic partnerships with civil society organizations, educational institutions, and media outlets, we actively promote awareness-raising campaigns and educational programs aimed at challenging harmful gender norms and fostering a more inclusive and equitable society.

To amplify our impact, we prioritize the integration of gender considerations across all our operations and investments. Our gender-responsive approach ensures that projects and initiatives are designed, implemented, and monitored with a keen eye towards promoting gender equality and addressing gender-specific barriers and opportunities.

While challenges persist, we remain steadfast in our commitment to advancing SDG 5 and creating an enabling environment for women and girls to thrive. By leveraging our expertise, resources, and partnerships, we strive to catalyze transformative change, foster inclusive economic growth, and contribute to the realization of a more equitable and prosperous future for all.
