Here is a detailed newspaper article on Sustainable Development Goal 5 - Gender Equality, as if written by The Washington Post:

Toward an Equitable World: The Imperative of Gender Equality

By Alexandra Sundaram, Global Development Correspondent

The rallying cry "human rights are women's rights, and women's rights are human rights" has reverberated across the globe for decades. Yet, despite progressive policies and hard-fought victories, the chasm of gender-based discrimination and marginalization persists, suffocating human potential and impeding sustainable socioeconomic progress. This harsh reality underscores the urgency of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 5 (SDG 5) – achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls.  

The statistics are staggering: An estimated 736 million women today were married before their 18th birthday. Over 200 million have undergone female genital mutilation. Women globally earn 77 cents for every dollar men make for the same work. One in three women worldwide has experienced physical or sexual violence. In conflict zones, systematic rape is employed as a depraved tactic of war. In many nations, women remain disenfranchised from fundamental rights – the rights to education, to own property, to make decisions about their own bodies. These grim figures transcend geographies and cultures, a sobering testament to the pervasiveness of patriarchal oppression.

The ramifications of gender inequality are profound and far-reaching. At its core, it represents a devastating human rights crisis, denying the intrinsic dignity of half the world's population. It catalyzes a vicious cycle of poverty, diminished health outcomes, hunger, and lack of economic opportunity that reverberates across families and communities. Girls deprived of education breed cycles of marginalization that jeopardize societal advancement. The McKinsey Global Institute estimates that $28 trillion could be added to the global GDP by 2025 by advancing women's equality. In essence, the subordination of women is both an ethical calamity and an impediment to collective human progress.

Addressing this mammoth challenge requires a multipronged, coordinated global effort. SDG 5 enshrines several vital targets: ending discrimination and violence against women; eliminating harmful practices like child marriage and female genital mutilation; recognizing unpaid care and domestic work; ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive healthcare; and promoting women's equal participation in leadership roles across all spheres. 

Realizing these ambitious objectives hinges on dismantling deeply-rooted patriarchal norms, attitudes and institutions that have pervaded societies for centuries. It demands revolutionary legislation to codify equal rights and opportunities, coupled with robust enforcement mechanisms. It necessitates sweeping overhauls of educational curricula, from the earliest years, to uproot regressive gender stereotypes. It compels engaging men and boys as stakeholders in this transformative journey. Most critically, it mandates amplifying the voices of women's rights organizations and grassroots feminist movements that have long spearheaded this righteous struggle.

There are glimmers of hope amidst the daunting challenges. In Rwanda, a pioneering law mandates women must comprise at least 30% of decision-making roles, resulting in over 60% female representation in parliament - the highest in the world. In India, decades of legislative reforms have codified women's rights in domains from education to workplace equality. The World Bank's support for adolescent girls' education initiatives in countries like Bangladesh, Liberia and South Sudan have yielded impressive gains in learning outcomes. 

Yet, progress remains achingly slow. The sobering reality is that at the current rate, it may take over 250 years to achieve SDG 5 globally. This glacial pace is simply unacceptable - we are depriving future generations of boundless human potential and leaving billions in economic gains on the table.

As a global community, we face an existential choice: continue treading the path of oppression and injustice or catalyze transformative change to unlock the transformative power of women's empowerment. Achieving gender equality is the hallmark of an enlightened society - one that harnesses the talents of all its people, unleashes the boundless promise of half its population and leads the world into a new age of sustainable development and human solidarity. We cannot afford to falter.
