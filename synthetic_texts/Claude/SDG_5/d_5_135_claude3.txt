Here is a draft academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 5 (Gender Equality) as if written by satirist Mark Steel:

Solving the Global Gender Equality Crisis by 2030: A Modest Proposal
By Dr. Mark Steel, Institute for Studies in the Bleedin' Obvious  

Having considered this Gender Equality conundrum at great length, I believe I've identified the core issue holding back our quest for Goal 5. It dawned on me during the semi-intermittent power cuts in my Thames-side flat that women don't have enough equal rights. Startling, I know, but bear with me. 

This insight came from thorough analysis of the data. For example, did you know that in our modern, progressive era, unbelievably there are still some countries where women don't even have the right to be beaten solely at the discretion of their spouse? I'm not making this up - it's a genuine human rights catastrophe unfolding before our eyes.

But it gets worse. Some places don't let women work the same grueling sweatshop hours as men. They're actively discriminated against and prevented from smashing the same rocks into smaller rocks all day! These blatant inequalities cannot stand.

Then there are those shocking places where young girls are denied their fundamental human right to forage on toxic landfill sites for recyclables to sell. Instead, they're forced into pursuing an education or something. For pity's sake, what kind of monster would deprive them of such character-building childhood experiences?  

The bottom line is we're failing globally on empowering women and providing them the equal opportunity to live in abject squalor. From New Delhi to Guatemala City, too many are cruelly allowed a basic standard of living and personal autonomy.

But I have a solution - a two-pronged "Equality Through Enforced Hardship" strategy to get us back on track for 2030. First, we systematically dismantle anything vaguely resembling robust social protections, public services, or worker rights worldwide. Safety nets only breed dependency, after all.  

Secondly, we institute a global "status equalization" program of imposed destitution for any fortunate woman who still enjoys adequate food, shelter, or lack of soul-crushing drudgery. Think of the fairness - at last, an impoverished Sri Lankan refugee can hold her head high, safe in the knowledge her dire circumstances are no worse than Paris Hilton's!

Progress won't be easy, I'll admit. We'll need to overcome staunch opposition from na√Øve idealists who want things like "respect for human dignity" or "basic economic/social rights." But with commitment and hard work, I believe we can realize a world of perfect gender equality by ensuring universal, grindingmisery for all by 2030. It's the only way to be fair.
