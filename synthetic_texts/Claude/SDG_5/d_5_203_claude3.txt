Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 5 (Gender Equality) as if written by renowned writer Gene Weingarten:

A Vicious Paradox: The Struggle for Gender Equality in a Profoundly Unequal World

by Gene Weingarten

When the Sustainable Development Goals were adopted by the United Nations in 2015, the decent among us permitted ourselves a glimmer of hope that genuine progress could be made toward substantive equality for womankind. SDG 5 laid out an ambitious roadmap for "achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls." Finally, the plight of the unfairer sex would be placed front and center on the global agenda.  

How naively optimistic we were.

Seven years later, the paradoxes and contradictions embedded in the quest for gender parity have become painfully obvious. We seek equality in a world violently rigged against it. We pursue empowerment within patriarchal systems designed to subjugate. It's akin to playing an elaborate game of multidimensional chess using logic borrowed from the fun-house mirror realm of misogyny.  

The statistics are sobering: Globally, women earn just 77 cents for every dollar paid to men for equivalent work. One in three women worldwide experience physical or sexual violence in their lifetime, most often from an intimate partner. Millions of girls are married as children each year, their bodies not just objectified but essentially stripped of personhood. In many cultures, women remain legally beholden to men in areas like inheritance, employment, and even freedom of movement. 

And that's just scratching the dimly polished veneer of oppression. Turn over the rocks of tradition and you'll find even more unsightly things slithering around — brutalities like sex trafficking, honor killings, and female genital mutilation. It's the underbelly of civilization laid bare, repulsive evidence that true gender equality remains an almost farcical concept in much of the world.

Some will counter that progress has been made, that SDG 5 is moving the needle, however slightly. They'll cite examples like increasing numbers of girls getting educated, or women gradually entering fields historically dominated by men. But zoom out and the bigger picture remains grotesquely unbalanced. This is not evolution; it's stratification. For every step forward, there are cases of horrific backsliding. In Afghanistan, the Taliban regime has effectively erased two decades of hard-won advances for women overnight.

Perhaps the greatest paradox is that even in societies that fancy themselves progressive, gender discrimination worms its way through the power structures like an insidious vine. Look no farther than America, where the overturning of Roe v. Wade represents a seismic body blow against female autonomy. How can we credibly export a doctrine of equality when a huge segment of our populace views it as antithetical to "family values"?  

The bitter truth is that the roots of misogyny run deeper than any sustainability goals can currently reach. We are shackled by the anchors of history, dogma, and baseless cultural assumptions about innate gender differences. Until we as a species fully repudiate the notion that a uterus equates to vulnerability or subordination, the unbearable double-standards will persist. 

Human civilization has brashly advanced in domains like technology, industry, and medicine. Yet our social evolution lags behind in ways both bewildering and appalling. We've tamed the forces of nature while remaining enslaved to the most primitive prejudices, all rooted in a fear of the female form.

At the bleeding edge of science, we now possess the ability to alter the human genome and extend life expectancies. Meanwhile, vast swaths of humanity cling to ancient mythologies that relegate women to second-class status. We have enough nuclear weapons to extinguish our species a hundred times over, but heaven forbid we grant 51% of the world's population equal rights without an apocalyptic fight.

The most galling realization? We are the only obstacle. Unlike bringing drought-ravaged regions back to life or reversing ecological devastation, achieving true gender equality requires no revolutionary new technology or bottomless capital reserves. It merely necessitates dismantling the invisible shackles forged by millennia of unchecked male insecurity and patriarchal hegemony.

This is our paradox: The moral arc of the universe may bend toward justice, but it is warped and weighed down by the sheer density of our flaws. For all our big brains and self-aggrandizing myths of exceptionalism, humanity at its core remains a stubbornly primitive beast ruled by Id.

And for now, Id insists the girls take a backseat. Repugnant? Absolutely. Inevitable? Tragically, that verdict remains horrifyingly uncertain as we strive to better ourselves against our most obdurate natures. That is the struggle bitterly encapsulated within SDG 5 — an acknowledgment that radical change is both vital and likely impossible until we confront the most deeply entrenched biases simmering in the depths of the human spirit.

It's enough to make you lose Hope, that other profound human Paradox.
