Here is a long academic article about SDG 5 (Gender Equality) as if written by Shobhaa De, the renowned Indian writer and commentator:

Achieving Nirvana on the Battlefield of Gender Equality

The fight for gender equality has been a labyrinthine saga, one replete with as many pitfalls as potholes on the cosmopolitan highways of our nation. We have whittled away at the patriarchal edifice, chipped at its crumbling foundations, yet the formidable structure of male domination remains largely intact, casting its pernicious shadow over our pursuit of genuine parity. The Sustainable Development Goals enshrine a lofty aspiration – a world where gender is no longer the overpowering arbiter of opportunity, where the feminine is neither subjugated nor circumscribed. But how do we traverse the muddied trenches to the verdant frontiers of true equality?

Let us commence with the egregious affliction gnawing at the wellbeing of our sisters – violence. The statistics read like an anthology of horror, each number a monstrous tale of brutality and subjugation. One in three women globally experience physical or sexual violence, primarily from an intimate partner. In the hallowed corridors of our own nation, crimes showing an outrageous disregard for the sanctity of the feminine form have become endemic – dowry deaths, acid attacks, and the unconscionable plague of female feticide. We must arouse a visceral societal revulsion towards such malevolent acts, inculcating a renaissance of respect for the feminine in the minds of sons and fathers alike.

Our energies must also focus on dismantling the glass ceilings that prevent women from soaring to the dizzying heights they are capable of. The business realm remains a male oligarchy, with a mere 14% of leadership roles occupied by women, even as competent, ambitious ladies are policed, their leadership traits unpalatably branded as 'bossy.' The political sphere is equally patriarchal – in our nation's highest deliberative bodies, the feminine voice is but a feeble murmur. Without women ascending to the highest echelons of authority, gender myopia will perpetually afflict our policies and governance.

If underprivileged women seek to escape the vicious cycles of penury, education is the tarnished but potentially radiant key. Yet, in thedusty hinterlands where poverty reigns, a despicable prejudice persists - daughters are perceived as transient houseguests whose education is an imprudent investment. Families prioritize the schooling of sons, nurturing self-perpetuating gender discrimination. We must uproot this malignant perception through vigorous advocacy, enshrining girls' education as a non-negotiable imperative. Only when women wield the emancipating force of learning can they be liberated from the interminable quicksand of patriarchy.

The crusade for gender equality is a multi-front war – the insidious issues are innumerable, the battlegrounds dispersed. But a shift in cultural paradigms is the paramount weapon to strike at the sordid roots of discrimination. Our epics depict women as powerful incarnations – Kali the vanquisher of evil, Durga the invincible warrior. Yet our prevalent socialization tragically distorts these archetypes, steadfastly impressing upon our daughters that subservience and docility are the virtuous rungs on the ladder to absurd, antiquated ideals of femininity. Adolescence is a maiden's most precarious battleground – education curriculums must empower her to deflect the cauldron of regressive influences and opt for a existence of empowerment and autonomy.

Ultimately, our collective metamorphosis into a society of enshrined gender parity will be grueling and generational. But the kaleidoscopic possibilities of a world where the birthright lottery of gender carries no undue advantages or disadvantages is an idyll worth tenaciously pursuing. Only when we exorcise the antiquated dogmas dictating female inferiority can we hope to bask in the nirvanic sunshine of achieved equality – a radiant horizon where opportunity blazes as brilliantly for the feminine soul as it does for the masculine harbinger of the dated status quo.
