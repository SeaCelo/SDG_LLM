The World Food Programme (WFP) recognizes the inextricable link between gender equality and food security, making Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5, "Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls," a strategic priority. As the leading humanitarian organization fighting hunger worldwide, we understand that addressing gender disparities is not only a moral imperative but also a crucial factor in achieving lasting solutions to global hunger and malnutrition.

Despite significant progress in recent decades, gender inequalities persist across all regions, exacerbated by deeply entrenched social norms, discriminatory laws and practices, and systematic disadvantages in access to resources, opportunities, and decision-making processes. These inequalities have far-reaching implications for food security, nutrition, and overall human development.

Women and girls disproportionately bear the burden of hunger and malnutrition, with higher rates of food insecurity and micronutrient deficiencies compared to their male counterparts. This gender disparity is further compounded by the unequal distribution of household responsibilities, which often relegates women to unpaid care work and limits their participation in productive activities and income-generating opportunities.

Moreover, gender-based violence, early and forced marriage, and limited access to education and health services create significant barriers for women and girls, perpetuating a vicious cycle of poverty, food insecurity, and disempowerment. In many regions, women face legal and cultural restrictions on land ownership, inheritance rights, and access to financial services, hindering their ability to invest in agricultural production, entrepreneurship, and sustainable livelihoods.

At the WFP, we recognize that promoting gender equality is not only a matter of human rights but also a strategic imperative for achieving zero hunger. Our interventions are designed to address the multidimensional challenges faced by women and girls, with a focus on empowerment, resilience, and transformative change.

Through our food assistance programs, we prioritize women's leadership and decision-making roles within households and communities, ensuring their voices are heard and their needs are met. We implement gender-transformative initiatives that challenge harmful social norms and promote positive masculinities, engaging men and boys as allies in the fight for gender equality.

Our livelihoods and resilience-building programs are designed to enhance women's economic empowerment, providing access to productive assets, training, and financial services. We work closely with local partners and stakeholders to create enabling environments that support women's entrepreneurship, equal employment opportunities, and equitable access to markets and value chains.

Furthermore, the WFP recognizes the importance of addressing intersectional vulnerabilities, as gender inequalities are often exacerbated by other factors such as age, disability, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Our interventions are tailored to meet the specific needs of marginalized groups, ensuring that no one is left behind in our pursuit of gender equality and food security.

Collaboration and partnerships are at the heart of our approach, as we work closely with governments, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders to promote gender-responsive policies, legislation, and institutional frameworks. We advocate for the integration of gender perspectives in national development strategies, ensuring that gender equality remains a cross-cutting priority across all sectors and levels of decision-making.

While substantial progress has been made, significant challenges remain in achieving SDG 5. Persistent gender inequalities, deeply rooted social norms, and intersectional vulnerabilities continue to hinder progress toward gender equality and food security. However, at the WFP, we remain steadfast in our commitment to empowering women and girls, recognizing their crucial role as agents of change and drivers of sustainable development.
