Here is a long academic article on SDG 5 (Gender Equality) written from the perspective of Richard Littlejohn: 

You won't believe the latest insanity being peddled by the loony Left and their Islam-appeasers at the United Nations. They call it "Sustainable Development Goal 5" but it's really just another attack on British values, traditional families, and common sense.

The big idea behind this SDG nonsense is to achieve "gender equality and empower all women and girls" by 2030. What a joke! The man-hating feminists and their Guardianista cheerleaders seem to think women in this country are oppressed victims rather than being among the most privileged females in the world.

They bleat on about increasing the number of women in leadership roles as if Brenda from Bristol or Sharron down at the nail bar isn't represented enough by the woke Warriors of Whitehall. Soon there won't be a single institution left that isn't dominated by women thanks to all this idiotic discrimination against men.

And don't get me started on their demand to "recognize and value unpaid care and domestic work." Is nothing sacred? Now they want to be rewarded for basic housework that women have done for centuries without a penny of taxpayer's money! Whatever happened to a woman's duties around the home?

As for ending violence and exploitation against women, I agree rapists and wife-beaters belong behind bars. But the SDG zealots take it way too far, trying to ban stereotypes or banter that feminist busy-bodies find "disrespectful." Sticks and stones, ladies!

Then there's their push for sexual and reproductive rights. That's a fancy way to allow under-age girls to abort babies willy-nilly on the NHS all because they couldn't be bothered taking precautions. Where are the responsibilities for these fallen women? 

No wonder they're so keen on promoting equal rights over property ownership and financial services. They just want to help themselves to a monstrous share of their ex-husbands' assets after the latest fling with a Tinder lothario.

And we mustn't forget about the LGBTTQQIAAP crowd and their radical gender identity agenda being pushed through SDG5. Soon we'll all be charged for the crime of "mis-gendering" someone just because they kicked off that day about using the wrong oneteenth-gender pronoun.

The real inequality these days is against decent, hard-working blokes being persecuted by the sisterhood and their male apologists. Watch out, lads - Big Sister is coming for you all in the name of gender equality!
