Here is a detailed academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 5: Gender Equality, as if written by the renowned economist Barry Julian Eichengreen:

Gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world. Yet despite considerable progress, gender inequality persists as one of the most pervasive forms of discrimination globally. Women and girls around the world continue to face violations of their most basic rights - to live free from violence, to attend school, to participate in decisions that affect their lives, to have control over their own bodies, and to have an equal voice in economic decision-making. 

Entrenched discrimination against women and girls remains a significant obstacle to economic development and shared prosperity. Failure to achieve SDG 5 on gender equality will undermine the ability to realize all the other Sustainable Development Goals and will come at tremendous cost - not only to women and girls themselves, but to their families, communities and nations. Indeed, gender inequality imposes large economic costs on counties at all income levels through a variety of channels.

Let us start by considering the impact on labor force participation rates. Across the world, women participate at far lower rates in the formal labor market than men. In no region do women enjoy full parity in access to economic opportunities. This gender disparity is largest in the Middle East and North Africa, where only one in five women participate in paid employment outside the home. But even in developed economies like the United States, the participation rate of women remains more than 10 percentage points below that of men.

Women's lower economic participation rates reflect a host of entrenched economic and social constraints, from lack of access to education and training to discriminatory attitudes, social norms and legal restrictions. It also reflects the disproportionate burden borne by women for unpaid domestic work and care responsibilities. In many countries, legal and institutional barriers compound this challenge by restricting women's ability to own and inherit property, obtain access to credit, and receive equal pay for equal work.

The economic costs of these obstacles are significant. First, countries suffer from allocative inefficiency, with women's economic potential squandered rather than fully deployed to maximize economic output. My research suggests that closing gender gaps in the labor market could raise annual global GDP by upwards of $28 trillion - a staggering 26 percent of the current global product.

Second, failure to fully incorporate women's talents and skills into the formal economy has negative implications for productivity and future growth prospects. With declining birthrates in many regions, female labor force participation will be critical for sustaining economic dynamism, replacing retiring workers, supporting social security systems, and generating the productivity gains necessary to drive economic expansion.

Gender inequality also impacts a variety of broader development outcomes that feedback into economic performance. Women's denial of equal rights over household economic resources has negative implications for child health, nutrition and education outcomes. Evidence shows that increasing women's control over household decision-making leads to higher investments in the human capital of children, with positive multiplier effects on future productivity. Conversely, discrimination against girls in access to education perpetuates intergenerational transmission of poverty.

Moreover, women's lack of empowerment and voice in household bargaining and society more broadly restricts their ability to make decisions over their own fertility and shapes the incentives associated with having children versus investing in market work. These distortions in fertility choices can contribute to further economic imbalances, such as population growth outpacing economic opportunities or excessively low birthrates leading to labor shortages.

The undeniable economic imperative to achieve gender equality has helped mobilize governments, donors and advocacy groups in support of SDG 5. Yet progress remains slow and uneven across countries. Perhaps most distressingly, intimate partner violence remains pervasive, impacting as many as one in three women globally over their lifetimes. Sexual violence deepens inequality by trapping survivors in cycles of poverty while inflicting immense psychosocial trauma with lasting economic consequences.

Efforts to narrow economic opportunity gaps must therefore be complemented by stronger legal frameworks to eliminate all forms of gender-based discrimination and violence. Institutional reforms to remove biases in legal systems, enshrine property rights, and promote equal participation in decision-making are essential. So too are investments in infrastructure and social safety nets to reduce and redistribute unpaid care burdens.

Ultimately, achieving SDG 5 will require a comprehensive strategy of tackling adverse social norms and attitudes that relegate women to subordinate or subservient roles. Legal and economic reforms alone will be insufficient without grassroots campaigns to engender more equitable gender attitudes through education, advocacy and positive role models.

While the challenges are formidable, the economic case for prioritizing gender equality is undeniable. Unleashing the full productive potential of half the world's population is not only an ethical and moral imperative - it is an essential driver of sustained, inclusive economic growth and development progress. Investing in the rights and dignity of women and girls is a powerful multiplier across the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and should be a transcendent global policy priority.
