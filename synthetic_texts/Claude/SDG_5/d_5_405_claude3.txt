The Center for Victims of Torture's (CVT) 2023 report on the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5, Gender Equality, highlights the intrinsic link between gender-based violence and torture. Our organization's work with survivors from conflict-affected regions worldwide underscores the urgent need for a comprehensive approach to achieving this goal.

Gender-based violence, including sexual violence, remains a pervasive tool of war and oppression. In regions plagued by armed conflicts, authoritarian regimes, and social unrest, women and gender minorities face heightened risks of torture, sexual exploitation, and abuse. Perpetrators employ these heinous acts as mechanisms of control, humiliation, and subjugation, inflicting profound physical and psychological trauma on victims.

CVT's extensive field research and client interactions reveal alarming patterns. In many contexts, gender-based violence and torture are inextricably intertwined, with the former often serving as a precursor or accompaniment to the latter. Women and gender minorities subjected to sexual violence frequently endure subsequent acts of torture, compounding their trauma and exacerbating their marginalization.

Furthermore, the stigma and shame associated with gender-based violence create significant barriers to accessing essential services, including medical care, psychosocial support, and legal recourse. This perpetuates a cycle of silence, impunity, and re-traumatization, hindering survivors' healing processes and reinforcing societal inequalities.

CVT's approach recognizes the multifaceted nature of this challenge and the need for a holistic response. Our intervention strategies encompass comprehensive rehabilitative care, empowerment initiatives, and advocacy efforts to address the root causes of gender-based violence and torture.

Through our interdisciplinary teams, we provide survivors with tailored psychotherapy, physical therapy, and social services, acknowledging the complex interplay of physical, emotional, and social consequences. Our trauma-informed approaches are grounded in cultural sensitivity and a deep understanding of the unique challenges faced by diverse gender identities.

Crucially, CVT's work extends beyond direct service provision. We engage in capacity-building programs that equip local organizations and communities with the knowledge and tools to prevent and respond to gender-based violence effectively. This includes training healthcare professionals, law enforcement personnel, and community leaders to recognize the signs of abuse, provide appropriate support, and promote accountability.

Moreover, CVT actively advocates for policy reforms and legislative changes that protect the rights of survivors and promote gender equality. We collaborate with governments, international organizations, and civil society to strengthen legal frameworks, enhance access to justice, and challenge harmful cultural norms and practices that perpetuate gender-based violence.

Achieving SDG 5 requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the root causes of gender-based violence and torture, empowers survivors, and transforms societal attitudes. CVT's holistic approach, grounded in empirical evidence and firsthand experiences, offers a roadmap for combating these intertwined scourges and promoting lasting change.

Through our tireless efforts, we strive to create a world where gender equality is not merely an aspiration but a lived reality, where all individuals can thrive free from violence, oppression, and discrimination.
