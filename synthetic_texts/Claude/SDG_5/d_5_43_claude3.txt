Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 5 (Gender Equality) from the perspective of Andrew Bolt:

The Folly of Forced Gender Equality Under the UN's SDG Agenda

By Andrew Bolt

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 5 to "Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls" reeks of divisive identity politics and social engineering run amok. Like many of the SDGs, it is a thinly-veiled Marxist ploy designed to undermine Western civilization under the guise of promoting "sustainability" and "equality." 

The radical gender theorists and feminist ideologues behind this SDG seek to demolish the very pillars of human society - the nuclear family and the complementary sexual roles of men and women. They perpetuate the myth of systemic discrimination and an oppressive "patriarchal" culture holding women back from achieving true equality. In reality, women in the West already enjoy unprecedented freedoms and legal protections.

This SDG is really about dismantling traditional gender norms and indoctrinating young minds with divisive identity narratives from the woke neo-Marxist cult. Just look at the specific targets, like eliminating "all harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation." These may be issues in certain developing nations still mired in outdated cultural practices, but they are complete non-issues in civilized Western societies that lead the world in women's rights. Yet the SDG lumps us all together in its self-loathing view of global misogyny.

Even more egregious are targets pushing for "reforms to give women equal rights to economic resources" and "equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic and public life." The sinister implication is that our capitalist economic system and democratically-elected leadership is somehow rigged against women. This is a damning lie bereft of facts. Women can already freely pursue any career, business opportunity or political path in our egalitarian nations based solely on merit and ambition.  

Forcing equal gender representation through quotas and wealth redistribution, as advocated by the SDGs, is just neo-Marxist class warfare rebranded. It is an authoritarian overreach that undermines freedom, competence and the natural harmonies between the sexes that have sustained humanity for millennia. A capable woman will rise to the top in our societies, while the mediocre will be unfairly promoted over more qualified individuals based on their gender.

At its core, the SDG on gender equality seeks to demonize men and wage an ideological war against masculinity itself. Masculine traits like strength, courage and competition are now "toxic" and must be expunged from the human experience. The end goal is to produce genderless humanoids devoid of any innate identity or biological reality. This dystopian nightmare is the very antithesis of sustainable human development.

Perhaps most noxious are the SDG's insinuations about "unpaid care and domestic work" somehow oppressing women as primary nurturers of family. As if being a dedicated mother and homemaker raising the next generation isn't the most vital role for our species' survival and flourishing? The SDG shamefully demeans and belittles this noble vocation.

In summary, under the guise of high-minded ideals, the SDG on gender equality is a radical, top-down imposition of neo-Marxist dogmas that undermines traditional family values, biological realities, freedom of choice and human identity itself. It is a divisive and inflammatory United Nations overreach that freeborn Western peoples should firmly reject and disdain.
