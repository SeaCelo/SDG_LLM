Here is a detailed newspaper article about Sustainable Development Goal 5 (Gender Equality), drafted as if written for Bloomberg Businessweek:

A Towering Missed Opportunity: The High Cost of Global Gender Inequality

By the Bloomberg Businessweek Editorial Board

The quest for gender parity isn't just a noble cause — it's an economic imperative that the business world can ill afford to ignore. As the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 5 underscores, achieving gender equality and empowering women and girls represents one of the grand challenges of our era. And the price of inaction is a towering missed opportunity with profound implications across all sectors.

The statistics are as staggering as they are sobering. Globally, women's participation in the labor force hovers around just 49%, over 25 percentage points lower than men's. The gender pay gap remains an intractable issue, with women earning 77 cents for every dollar paid to men. And while women account for over half the world's population, they contribute a mere 37% to global GDP.

These aren't just inequities—they're inefficiencies strangling economic growth and human capital. According to McKinsey, closing the gender gap could add a staggering $28 trillion to the global GDP by 2025. That's not just real money being left on the table, but innovation being squandered, talent underutilized, and progress impeded.

The insidious tendrils of gender discrimination fray every sector of commerce. In agriculture, lack of access to resources, financing, and land rights hampers the productivity of the 500 million smallholder farm households run by women. The UN estimates that equal access could raise farm yields by 20-30%. In finance, women are less likely to have bank accounts or access to capital, miring them in subsistence living. If women participated equally as entrepreneurs, global GDP could rise by up to 6%.

Dig deeper into the data, and the exclusion of women resonates across industries. Women make up less than a third of the global STEM workforce. Just 5% of Fortune 500 CEOs are female. In the EU, only 34% of entrepreneurs are women. The gnawing void of untapped female talent haunts every link in the value chain.

But beyond the sheer economic waste, thriving gender discrimination fuels societal and political instability. When half a population is systematically disempowered, disenfranchised, and denied opportunity, civic engagement and inclusive governance wither. Gender-based violence traumatizes communities. Child marriage and adolescent pregnancy stunt human development.

The business case for gender equality is clear, compelling, and backed by a growing body of evidence. More gender-diverse companies consistently outperform their peers on measures like profitability and innovation. Parity promotes resilience, agility, and diversity of thought—advantages no enterprise can neglect in today's volatile landscape.

True, dismantling the structural barriers, unconscious biases, and cultural norms impeding SDG 5 is daunting. But as the Paradigm for Parity movement demonstrates, business is uniquely positioned to drive transformation through enlightened policies, accommodative practices, and inclusive leadership. Companies that treat gender empowerment as integral to their sustainability strategy—not a peripheral CSR effort—will emerge as the economy's vanguard.

From implementing recruitment, retention, and promotion best practices to cultivating an environment of safety, dignity and opportunity, corporations shape the playing field. Businesses leading on pay equity, family leave, anti-harassment protocols, and executive sponsorship aren't just building better workplaces—they're laying the groundwork for thriving economies and prosperous societies.

The choice is clear: scatter resources by excluding half the workforce and consumer base, or catalyze a virtuous cycle of poverty reduction, household resilience, productivity gains, and GDP growth by unleashing the dynamism and talents of women.

No goal is more cross-cutting than gender equality. As the world grapples with food insecurity, climate change, conflict, and economic headwinds, it's past time for the public and private sectors to stop hobbling themselves and start harnessing the full potential of humankind to solve our greatest challenges. The alternative is far too costly.
