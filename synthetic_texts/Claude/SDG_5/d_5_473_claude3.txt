Here is a detailed newspaper article about Sustainable Development Goal 5 - Gender Equality, written in the style of the Harvard Business Review:

Unlocking the Power of Gender Equality for Sustainable Economic Growth

By failing to fully unleash the potential of women, businesses and economies are missing out on an extraordinary source of innovation, talent, and growth. While some progress has been made in recent decades, gender inequality remains a profound and pervasive challenge across the globe - and overcoming it must be a strategic priority for leaders.

The economic case for promoting gender parity is overwhelming. Research shows that increasing women's workforce participation rates at par with men could raise GDP by 5% in the U.S., 9% in Japan, 12% in the UAE, and a staggering 34% in Egypt. Companies with more women in leadership roles consistently outperform those without, yet the higher you go up the corporate ladder, the fewer women you see.

Beyond representation, there is a persistent gap in earnings, opportunities, and workplace treatment and respect. The pandemic exacerbated these disparities, with women suffering higher job losses, bearing greater burdens of unpaid care work, and facing surges in gender-based violence. In many parts of the world, discriminatory laws and social norms institutionalize second-class status for women and girls.

Yet as this array of challenges makes clear, gender inequality is not just a women's issue - it is an economic and societal imperative that affects us all. True gender equality unlocks transformational benefits for businesses:

- A Deeper Talent Pool: Expanding opportunities for women dramatically widens the pipeline of human capital companies can draw upon. Why would any organization want to restrict itself to just half the population?

- More Innovation: Research shows that greater gender diversity produces more innovative thinking, creativity, and problem-solving.

- Improved Governance: Companies with more women directors experience higher firm valuations and better oversight of risk.

- Enhanced Brand & Reputation: In today's environment, a lack of gender diversity is a red flag for customers, investors, and top talent alike.

- Better Decision-Making: Gender-diverse teams process information more objectively and make higher quality decisions.

Leading companies recognize these advantages and are taking bold steps:

- Shattering Stereotypes: Changing workplace cultures that perpetuate bias is crucial. Leaders must vigilantly examine and uproot gender stereotyping that constrains women's opportunities from the start.  

- Equitable Policies: Paid family leave, affordable childcare, flexible work - policies supporting work/life integration allow women and men to thrive as both employees and parents.

- Sponsorship & Mentorship: Top talent needs champions who advocate and create pathways for high-potential women to take on major roles and responsibilities.

- Leadership Commitment: Setting measurable goals, transparently tracking data, and tying compensation to diversity progress signals real commitment from the C-suite.

Simply stated, gender equality is not just good values - it's great business strategy. By capitalizing on the enormous reservoir of talent that women represent, companies gain an enduring competitive advantage in today's innovation-driven economy. The brightest leaders understand that accelerating this transition is not just the right thing to do, but a surefire way to boost bottom lines. Gender equity must rise as a top priority for any forward-looking organization hoping to thrive in the decades ahead.
