WaterAid's Analytical Report on SDG 5: Gender Equality

Achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls is a critical catalyst for sustainable development, cutting across multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Without addressing the persistent barriers and discriminatory norms that impede women's and girls' full participation in society, the global community risks falling short of its ambitious 2030 Agenda.

Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions are intrinsically linked to SDG 5, as women and girls disproportionately bear the burden of collecting water and managing household sanitation and hygiene needs. In many developing countries, women and girls spend countless hours each day fetching water from distant sources, compromising their educational, economic, and social opportunities. This arduous task also exposes them to heightened risks of violence, harassment, and assault. Moreover, inadequate access to safe, private, and hygienic sanitation facilities in schools, workplaces, and public spaces perpetuates discriminatory practices, undermines dignity, and impedes women's and girls' ability to fully participate in all spheres of life.

WaterAid's interventions prioritize gender-responsive programming, recognizing that addressing gender inequalities is essential to achieving sustainable WASH outcomes. Through community-led initiatives, we engage men, women, and traditional leaders to challenge harmful gender norms and promote inclusive decision-making processes. Our approach empowers women and girls as agents of change, fostering their leadership skills and amplifying their voices in WASH governance and management.

In Tanzania, for instance, WaterAid's "Maintaining Dignity" project has transformed menstrual hygiene management practices in schools, ensuring girls can attend classes without shame or disruption. By constructing gender-segregated latrines with water and disposal facilities, providing menstrual health education, and engaging boys and men as allies, the project has fostered a supportive environment that destigmatizes menstruation and promotes gender equality in education.

Furthermore, our initiatives in Bangladesh have demonstrated the catalytic impact of addressing WASH and gender inequalities in tandem. Through community-based approaches, we have facilitated the formation of women's self-help groups, which not only improve WASH access but also provide platforms for collective action, income-generating activities, and advocacy for women's rights. These groups have successfully influenced local government budgets to prioritize WASH infrastructure, while simultaneously challenging discriminatory social norms and promoting women's leadership in decision-making processes.

However, achieving SDG 5 requires far more than localized interventions. It demands a concerted, multi-stakeholder effort to address the deep-rooted structural barriers and systemic discrimination that perpetuate gender inequalities. WaterAid's advocacy efforts, therefore, extend beyond the WASH sector, collaborating with diverse partners to influence policies, legislation, and budgetary allocations that promote gender mainstreaming across all development sectors.

In Nepal, our advocacy efforts have contributed to the adoption of a comprehensive national Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM) policy, ensuring the integration of MHM considerations into WASH programming, education curricula, and workplace regulations. This policy breakthrough not only improves WASH access but also challenges the stigma and discrimination associated with menstruation, fostering an enabling environment for women's and girls' empowerment.

While progress has been made, persistent challenges remain. Entrenched patriarchal attitudes, inadequate financing for gender-responsive WASH interventions, and the disproportionate burden of unpaid care work borne by women and girls continue to hinder the realization of SDG 5. Additionally, the intersectionality of gender with other factors, such as poverty, disability, and conflict, exacerbates vulnerabilities and marginalization, necessitating tailored, context-specific approaches.

As we approach the 2030 deadline, WaterAid remains steadfast in its commitment to gender equality and women's empowerment. Our integrated WASH and gender programming, coupled with robust advocacy efforts, aims to catalyze transformative change at the individual, community, and systemic levels. By addressing the inextricable links between WASH, gender, and sustainable development, we strive to create an enabling environment where all women and girls can exercise their fundamental human rights, reach their full potential, and contribute to the creation of more equitable, inclusive, and prosperous societies.
