The Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) recognizes the pivotal role of Gender Equality (SDG 5) in catalyzing sustainable development across our member countries. Despite commendable progress, deep-rooted gender disparities continue to undermine the full realization of human potential and societal prosperity.

In line with our unwavering commitment to the Maqasid al-Shari'ah (higher objectives of Islamic law), which promote justice, equality, and human dignity, we have intensified efforts to mainstream gender perspectives across our operations. Our approach is guided by Islamic principles that uphold the equal worth and rights of men and women, while acknowledging the unique contexts and cultural sensitivities of our diverse member nations.

Through our flagship programs, we have prioritized interventions that address the multidimensional challenges faced by women and girls. Our investments in education have focused on increasing access to quality learning opportunities, particularly in STEM fields, empowering young women with the skills and knowledge to thrive in a rapidly evolving global economy. Simultaneously, we have collaborated with stakeholders to dismantle socio-cultural barriers that impede girls' education, such as gender-based violence and discriminatory social norms.

Recognizing the inextricable link between economic empowerment and gender equality, we have scaled up initiatives that promote women's entrepreneurship and financial inclusion. Our Microfinance Development Program has provided Islamic microfinance services to over 1.2 million women, enabling them to establish sustainable livelihoods and contribute to their households' economic well-being. Furthermore, our Islamic Solidarity Fund for Development has supported capacity-building programs that enhance women's entrepreneurial skills, market access, and access to Shari'ah-compliant financing.

Acknowledging the disproportionate burden of unpaid care work shouldered by women, we have actively advocated for policies and infrastructure investments that alleviate this burden. Our projects have prioritized the provision of clean water, sanitation, and renewable energy solutions, reducing the time and effort women dedicate to collecting water and fuel â€“ resources that can be redirected towards productive and empowering pursuits.

In the realm of health, our interventions have focused on improving maternal and child health outcomes, addressing the unique challenges faced by women and girls. We have supported the establishment of comprehensive healthcare facilities, training medical professionals, and raising awareness on critical issues such as reproductive health, nutrition, and preventive care.

Moreover, we have actively engaged in dialogue and partnerships to promote women's leadership and decision-making roles across all spheres of society. Our capacity-building initiatives have empowered women with the skills and confidence to assume leadership positions in governance, business, and community development. We have also advocated for legislative reforms that enshrine gender equality principles and eliminate discriminatory laws and practices.

While significant progress has been made, we acknowledge that persistent challenges remain. Entrenched patriarchal norms, conflict and fragility, and the disproportionate impact of climate change on women continue to impede the realization of gender equality. As such, we remain steadfast in our commitment to addressing these multifaceted challenges through a holistic and context-sensitive approach.

Drawing upon the rich Islamic tradition of promoting justice and human dignity, we will continue to leverage our resources, expertise, and partnerships to accelerate progress towards SDG 5. Our unwavering dedication to empowering women and girls is not only a moral imperative but also a strategic investment in the sustainable development of our member nations and the global community at large.
