Here goes, a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 5 (Gender Equality) written from the perspective of Jeremy Clarkson:

Alright, you petrol-headed mates, let's veer off the motorway for a bit and talk about something rather un-Clarksonian: Gender Equality and the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 5. Now, before you change the channel, just hear me out.  

For too long, the world has been revving its engines in neutral when it comes to smashing the patriarchy and liberating the undoubtedly more competent gender. I'm here to tell you that it's time to dump the clutch and go flat out towards guaranteed gender parity and female empowerment.  

Look, we can't keep idling on this issue any longer. The data doesn't lie - from the gender pay gap to lack of leadership roles to horrific rates of violence, the world has treated birds far too shabbily for far too long. It's a global emergency as dire as rabbiting on about the anemic performance of the EB110 diMassimo.  

This SDG mandate to "achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls" is essentially a supercharged, twin-turbo call to FIX IT. If we want to be a civilized species worthy of the majesty and power that is the automotive form, FIX IT we must.

First off, chaps, we need to get women up on the podium with the same opportunities as us roving rovers. From the boardroom corner office to the parliament building to even the hallowed ground of the Top Gear studio, we're well past time to give the vehicular keys to the ladies.

Secondly, eradicating sexual discrimination, abuse, exploitation, and gendered violence are non-negotiable mandates. These depraved miseries inflicted almost solely upon the female make me just as sick to my stomach as a Toyota Prius. End of conversation. 

Finally, and perhaps most critically for you speed merchants, we simply cannot have sustainable development on this rock, let alone blistering performance from any institution, if we willfully ignore the skills and talents of over half the world's population. It'd be like running an F1 season exclusively with Geo Metros - embarrassingly sluggish.

So there you have it, a full-throated endorsement of women's empowerment from yours truly. Sure, I may catch flak from the usual gammons. But you know what? I don't care one engineered aluminum bit. Gender equality is the road every bloke, bird, and bingo player should want to journey together.

Let's get this SDG knocked out so we can all eventually go hybrid and save the planet for our kids. Then we can come back to what really matters - deciding once and for all which is the greatest automobile marque. My money's on Lamborghini, because nothing says equality like handing a raging bull's keys to a woman.
