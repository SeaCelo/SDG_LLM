Here is a detailed academic article about UN Sustainable Development Goal 5 (Gender Equality) from the perspective of renowned Canadian commentator Rex Murphy:

The Enduring Crisis of Gender Inequality: A Clarion Call for Upheaval 

In this perpetually restless world, where the status quo is a rebuke to the human imperative of progress, there persists an intractable ill - the systemic, insidious, and globally pervasive plight of gender discrimination. It is an ancient blight that has metastasized across cultures, continents, and centuries, flourishing like a malignant force, impervious to the incremental remedies and ameliorative gestures of generations past. 

Despite the caterwauling of politicians pontificating on the centrality of gender parity, and the profuse institutional resources ostensibly directed at this objective, we remain ensnared in the coils of an oppressive patriarchy. The bitter truth? Mere rhetoric and tokenistic initiatives are crumbs cast upon an intransigent behemoth that requires seismic upheaval to be upended.  

This malady courses through every societal vein – the scourge of domestic violence that devastates the sanctity and sanctuary of the home; the unconscionable denial of educational opportunities foreclosing the boundless potential of young minds; antiquated cultural dictates proscribing the full economic and civic engagement of half the populace; the pernicious under-representation of female voices in spheres of power and influence. These are but accoutrements of the underlying pathology – the obdurate and wholly manmade malady of unequal rights, unequal opportunities, and the dehumanizing perception of women as subordinates in the human chronicle.

The costs of inertia are apocalyptic in scale. Societies comprised of wasted human capital and unrealized potential are crippled by this moral, economic, and demographic rot consuming them from within. Yet this crisis represents far more than a squandered dividend – it is an existential offense against the sovereign dignity and inalienable liberties that are the primordial birthrights of all people. It corrodes the very soul of humanity.

And so, once more unto the breach with resounding exhortations for decisive, uncompromising action. Incrementalism will not suffice in eviscerating the systemic and multi-generational biases, the ingrained prejudices, the archaic dogmas, and the insidious double-standards obstructing our collective emancipation from this morass. No, this scourge demands catalytic jolts – a uncompromising reordering of institutional frameworks, a dismantling of patriarchal power structures, and a recalibration of societal norms that have rendered women subordinates in the human experience. 

The empowerment of women through enhancing their autonomy, their economic opportunities, their representation in decision-making spheres, their liberation from violence and oppression – these are not munificent concessions from the patriarchy, but the mere prerequisites for functional societies. Optimal human development, lasting peace, environmental custodianship, the unbridled flourishing of human potential – none of the exalted accomplishments of our specious can be realized while retaining an order that denies the centrality of women and perpetuates systemic discrimination.

Gender equality is the civic and moral imperative of our epoch. It is an existential struggle that transcends boundaries, politics, and ideology. It is a battle being waged by billions for the emancipation of billions more – a primal struggle to wrest free from the shackles of history and exhalt our species to unprecedented horizons. The rallying cry resounds across nations for a revolution - not merely legal and institutional reforms, but a seismic upheaval of consciousness, culture, and the immutable certainties that have tethered us to an immoral doctrine of discrimination. Audacious in ambition, implacable in resolve, and consecrated to the righteous ideal of unconditional human equality as sacrosanct truth. This is the monumental calling.
