Azerbaijan has made significant strides towards achieving Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment, as outlined in Sustainable Development Goal 5 (SDG 5). However, despite the progress, challenges persist, requiring sustained efforts to address deep-rooted societal norms and structural barriers.

Gender disparities in labor force participation remain a concern, with women disproportionately engaged in informal and lower-paying sectors. This disparity is compounded by the persistent gender wage gap, which stands at an average of 47%, reflecting entrenched discriminatory practices and patriarchal attitudes. Concerted efforts are needed to promote equal opportunities, address occupational segregation, and ensure equitable remuneration for work of equal value.

While Azerbaijan has achieved near-parity in primary education enrollment, disparities persist at higher levels, particularly in fields traditionally dominated by men, such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Targeted interventions, including initiatives to combat gender stereotypes and promote role models, are crucial to empowering girls and women in these domains.

Violence against women remains a pervasive issue, with an estimated 13.5% of women aged 15-49 having experienced physical or sexual violence from an intimate partner. Moreover, the prevalence of harmful practices, such as child marriage and gender-biased sex selection, continues to undermine the rights and well-being of girls and women. Strengthening legal frameworks, enhancing access to support services, and fostering societal attitudes that reject all forms of violence and discrimination are essential.

Despite legislative provisions for equal rights, women remain underrepresented in decision-making processes at all levels, from households to national governance structures. As of 2021, women held only 21% of parliamentary seats, reflecting the persisting barriers to their full and effective participation in political and public life. Concerted efforts are needed to promote women's leadership, including through capacity-building initiatives, mentorship programs, and measures to counter gender-based discrimination and harassment.

Azerbaijan's transition to a more diversified and knowledge-based economy presents opportunities for women's economic empowerment. However, realizing this potential requires targeted interventions to address the intersecting challenges faced by women, including access to finance, entrepreneurship support, and digital literacy. Collaboration with the private sector and civil society organizations can catalyze innovative approaches and promote inclusive economic growth.

Addressing the multifaceted challenges of gender inequality demands a holistic and intersectional approach. Efforts must be directed towards transforming discriminatory social norms, enhancing legal and policy frameworks, and fostering an enabling environment for women's empowerment. Comparative analysis with countries that have achieved notable progress, such as Iceland and Sweden, can provide valuable insights into effective strategies and best practices.

Furthermore, engaging men and boys as allies is crucial for creating a sustainable culture of gender equality. Initiatives that promote positive masculinities, challenge toxic gender norms, and raise awareness about the benefits of gender parity for society as a whole can accelerate progress towards SDG 5.

Achieving gender equality and women's empowerment is not only a moral imperative but also a critical driver of sustainable development. By leveraging the full potential of women and girls, Azerbaijan can unlock transformative economic, social, and environmental benefits, positioning itself as a regional leader in promoting inclusive and equitable societies.
