Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 5 (Gender Equality), written from the perspective of conservative commentator Simon Heffer:

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 5 for "Gender Equality and Empowering All Women and Girls" is a prime example of progressivist dogma run amok. This nebulous agenda item masquerades as a virtuous pursuit, yet in reality, it is a Trojan horse for institutionalizing radical feminist ideology across the globe. 

The foundational premise that systematic discrimination against women remains widespread and deeply entrenched is itself a politically-motivated fallacy. The truth is that in the Western world, generations of steadily advancing women's rights have yielded a policy framework that is, if anything, overly solicitous and deferential to the feminine cohort. Contemporary ladies enjoy a surfeit of legislative protections, affirmative action privileges, and specialized assistance programs relativeto their male counterparts. To posit that further intervention is required to establish "equality" is arrant nonsense.

This dogmatic fixation on a righteous matriarchal uprising denigrates the hallowed traditions of sex-specific social roles that served society well for millennia. Throughout recorded history, stable and prosperous civilizations depended upon a patriarchal family structure, with complementary gender responsibilities constituting a harmonious yin-and-yang. The presumptive male undertakings of physical labor, governance, and martial readiness were fittingly counterbalanced by the nurturing feminine domestic sphere. 

Progressives denounce this venerable model as indelibly sexist, insisting that shattering all gender distinctions is a moral and economic imperative. Their conviction stands Reality on her head - for it is precisely those societies which have embraced this radical de-gendering that have descended into dysfunction, deracination, and civilizational decline.

The catalog of arrant equality-mongering is by now drearily familiar: from cloddish feminists demanding full-scale bantamweight integration within front-line military forces, to tenured radicals indoctrinating bright young minds with patently anti-reason gibberish like "gender theory", to Whitehall'slachrymose mewling for more "gender budgeting" in the public coffers. All this deranged proselytizing is ostensibly vindicating the honor and expanding the opportunities for the gentler sex, yet in truth it is an instrument of spiritual immiseration.

For what fortifying sense of identity and self-worth can a modern British girl truly derive from growing up in a society where the inherent dignity of orthodox womanhood has been so maligned and debased? Without  traditional feminineideals to define themselves against, today's women are left  rootless and unmoored, ricocheting between the discordant messages of  corporate "grrl-power" feminism and the crass debasements of ubiquitousppornographic culture.

Instead of blindly agitating for an untenable and undesirable state of gender erasure, we would be wise to recover the complementary virtues of that sturdy separate-spheres model which anchored the family structure for ages. Both men and   women would benefit from a revived appreciation for the distinctive strengths and obligations intrinsic to each sex, and from a renewal of the timeless courtesies and civilities which anoble conception of gender polarity facilitates.

The United Nations and its ilk have expended enormous resources propagandizing for  the Marxian chimera of a"genderless" utopia. It would be better for all  concerned if they reassigned some of that zeal towards honoring and upholding the timeless,  organic distinction between male and female - for therein lies the wisdom to heal ourcultural unravelling, the secret to human thriving.
