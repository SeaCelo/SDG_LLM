The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has long recognized the inextricable link between gender equality and sustainable human mobility. As the United Nations' migration agency, we understand that achieving Sustainable Development Goal 5 (SDG 5) – Gender Equality – is not only a fundamental human right but also a prerequisite for sustainable development and effective migration governance.

Our comprehensive analytical report delves into the intricate dynamics that shape the experiences of women and girls on the move, shedding light on the multifaceted challenges they face and the opportunities that exist for empowerment. Drawing from our extensive fieldwork and evidence-based research, we present a nuanced understanding of the intersections between gender, migration, and development.

Migration can be both a catalyst for gender equality and a manifestation of existing inequalities. Women and girls often migrate in pursuit of improved economic opportunities, access to education, or to escape gender-based violence and discrimination. However, the migration journey itself can expose them to heightened risks of exploitation, trafficking, and abuse, particularly in the context of irregular migration and displacement.

Within this complex landscape, we highlight the disproportionate impact of crises, conflicts, and climate-related disasters on women and girls. Forced displacement scenarios exacerbate pre-existing gender inequalities, with women and girls facing increased vulnerability to gender-based violence, limited access to essential services, and barriers to economic and social integration in host communities.

Our report also sheds light on the pervasive gender norms and socio-cultural barriers that obstruct women's empowerment and perpetuate the cycle of inequality. Deeply rooted patriarchal structures, limited access to education, and restricted decision-making power within households and communities impede women's ability to exercise agency over their lives and migration choices.

Furthermore, we examine the critical role of remittances in alleviating poverty and promoting gender equality. Women migrants often contribute a significant portion of their earnings to support families and communities back home, challenging traditional gender roles and fostering economic empowerment. However, we also highlight the need for safer and more affordable remittance transfer mechanisms to maximize the impact of these crucial financial flows.

Recognizing the multidimensional nature of gender inequality, our analysis delves into the intersections of gender with other socio-economic factors, such as age, ethnicity, disability, and sexual orientation. We underscore the compounded vulnerabilities faced by marginalized groups, including female-headed households, unaccompanied migrant children, and LGBTQI+ individuals, who often encounter heightened discrimination and barriers to accessing essential services and support networks.

Importantly, our report underscores the vital contributions of women migrants to both origin and destination communities. They serve as agents of change, fostering cultural exchange, knowledge transfer, and economic growth. By challenging traditional gender norms and advocating for their rights, women migrants can catalyze broader societal transformations and pave the way for more inclusive and equitable migration governance frameworks.

In conclusion, our analytical report emphasizes the urgency of mainstreaming gender considerations into all aspects of migration governance and development policies. We call for concerted efforts to address the root causes of gender inequality, enhance access to education and economic opportunities, and promote the active participation of women and girls in decision-making processes. Only through a comprehensive and intersectional approach can we ensure that no one is left behind, and that migration becomes a pathway to empowerment, rather than a perpetuation of inequalities.
