The Fight for Equity: Removing Barriers to Gender Equality

By Amelia Ramirez, Newsday Staff Writer

When the United Nations adopted the Sustainable Development Goals in 2015, the global community vowed to rectify long-standing injustices and create a more equitable world by 2030. Among these objectives, SDG 5 – to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls – has emerged as a clarion call to dismantle systemic prejudices that have oppressed half the world's population for centuries.

The magnitude of this undertaking cannot be overstated. Despite significant progress, gender discrimination pervades societies in every corner of the globe. According to UN Women, 49 countries currently have no laws protecting women from domestic violence. Alarmingly, 1 in 3 women and girls experience gender-based violence in their lifetime. The economic toll is staggering, with conservative estimates indicating gender-based discrimination costs the global economy $12 trillion annually.

As former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton poignantly stated, "Women's rights are human rights, once and for all." This truth underpins SDG 5's transformative agenda to secure equal opportunities, resources, and influence for all genders. From eradicating harmful practices like child marriage and female genital mutilation to promoting economic empowerment and greater participation in decision-making spheres, the goal charts an ambitious course.

Dr. Sarah Hendriks, Director of Gender Studies at Stony Brook University, underscores the goal's relevance in our region. "Long Island has made meaningful strides toward gender parity in areas like education and workforce participation, but disparities persist," she notes. "The gender pay gap here is around 20%, meaning women earn 80 cents for every dollar men make for the same work. That's unacceptable in 2023."

Systemic Inequities Perpetuate Disadvantages 
At the crux of the gender equality challenge lies the reality that seemingly innocuous social norms often enshrine discrimination into institutions and power structures. Outmoded biases stifle opportunities from birth, manifesting in unequal access to education, employment, healthcare, legal protections, and civic engagement.

"Patriarchal mindsets limit our horizons from childhood," remarks Maria Gonzalez, a student activist at Hofstra University. "Girls are conditioned to conform to constrictive gender roles, while socioeconomic disparities disproportionately burden women with unpaid domestic labor and limit their economic potential."   

Such entrenched disadvantages perpetuate a cyclical poverty trap, making it harder for women to accumulate human capital and achieve financial independence. The ramifications reverberate through generations as unequal pay and uneven domestic responsibilities undermine women's ability to build wealth and social safety nets.

A Holistic Approach to Unleashing Human Potential
Tackling gender inequality demands a holistic, all-hands-on-deck strategy, encompassing strengthened legal frameworks, public awareness campaigns, and interventions in education, healthcare, and the workplace. Partnerships that unite governments, civil society organizations, faith-based groups and the private sector offer pathways to accelerate progress.

On Long Island, nonprofits like the Hispanic Brotherhood, the Nassau County Women's Bar Association, and the Long Island Fund for Women and Girls actively champion gender equity through legal aid, mentorship programs, and advocacy initiatives. Yet, experts argue a renewed societal commitment is crucial to sustaining momentum.

"Beyond establishing a level playing field through targeted programs and policies, we must fundamentally shift cultural narratives to eliminate biases and embrace diverse leadership models," asserts Dr. Hendriks. "When women and girls can pursue their aspirations free of judgment or constraints, our communities thrive."

According to a McKinsey report, achieving global gender parity could add $28 trillion to the world's annual GDP by 2025. Unlocking these vast economic dividends necessitates bold actions to demolish glass ceilings, eliminate gender-based violence, and amplify women's voices in decision-making arenas from households to the highest corridors of power.

As the deadline for the 2030 Agenda rapidly approaches, activists and policymakers alike recognize SDG 5 as pivotal to harnessing humanity's full innovative and productive potential. Dismantling gender discrimination fuels a positive feedback loop – empowered women uplift communities, shaping inclusive societies that nurture equal opportunities for future generations.

"We have a moral imperative and a tremendous economic incentive to get this right," reflects Gonzalez. "Realizing true gender equality will require tenacity and resolve, but the transformative impact on lives and livelihoods globally makes it an indispensable pursuit."
