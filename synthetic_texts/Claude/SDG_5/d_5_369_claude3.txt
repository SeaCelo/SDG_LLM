The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) recognizes the pivotal role of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5, aimed at achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls, in addressing the multifaceted challenges of global food insecurity, poverty, and sustainable rural development. SDG 5 is inextricably linked to IFAD's mandate of transforming rural economies and increasing agricultural productivity, as empowering women and ensuring their equal rights and opportunities is fundamental to unlocking the full potential of rural communities.

IFAD's approach to SDG 5 is rooted in the recognition that women play a crucial role in agriculture, comprising a significant proportion of the agricultural labor force in many developing countries. However, persistent gender inequalities, including limited access to productive resources, discriminatory social norms, and lack of decision-making power, hamper their productivity and overall well-being. By addressing these systemic barriers, IFAD aims to create an enabling environment that empowers women as key agents of change in the fight against poverty and hunger.

Through its investments and policy engagement, IFAD promotes gender-transformative approaches that challenge and reshape unequal gender norms, relations, and power dynamics. This entails supporting women's economic empowerment by facilitating their access to land, credit, markets, and productive assets, as well as enhancing their participation in decision-making processes within households and communities. For instance, IFAD's projects in Sub-Saharan Africa have successfully increased women's access to land tenure rights, leading to improved food security and household resilience.

Furthermore, IFAD recognizes the importance of addressing the disproportionate burden of unpaid care and domestic work shouldered by women in rural areas, which often constrains their productive and economic potential. By promoting labor-saving technologies, such as improved water and energy infrastructure, and encouraging the redistribution of unpaid care responsibilities within households, IFAD aims to alleviate women's time poverty and enable their participation in income-generating activities.

Notably, IFAD's approach to SDG 5 extends beyond its project interventions. The organization actively advocates for gender-responsive policies and institutional reforms at national and global levels, ensuring that gender equality is mainstreamed across agricultural and rural development strategies. By collaborating with governments, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders, IFAD contributes to creating an enabling policy environment that supports women's empowerment and addresses structural barriers to gender equality.

IFAD's commitment to SDG 5 is underpinned by a comprehensive gender policy and strategy, which guides the organization's operations and investments. This policy recognizes the intersectionality of gender with other social identities, such as age, ethnicity, and disability, and emphasizes the need for tailored interventions that address the specific needs and vulnerabilities of diverse groups of women.

To illustrate the impact of IFAD's work, consider the Rural Livelihoods' Adaptation to Climate Change in the Horn of Africa (RLACCAH) project, implemented in Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, and Sudan. This project has successfully integrated a gender-transformative approach by promoting women's leadership and decision-making roles in natural resource management, as well as supporting their access to climate-resilient livelihood opportunities. As a result, women's participation in community-based organizations has increased, and their voices are being heard in shaping climate adaptation strategies.

IFAD's commitment to SDG 5 is a testament to the organization's recognition that gender equality is not only a fundamental human right but also a critical driver of sustainable rural development and food security. By empowering women as agents of change and addressing structural barriers to their empowerment, IFAD contributes to creating more resilient, inclusive, and productive rural communities, ultimately advancing the overarching goal of eradicating poverty and hunger worldwide.
