Light for the World, an international disability and development organization, recognizes the paramount importance of Sustainable Development Goal 5 (SDG 5) â€“ achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls. This goal is inextricably linked to our mission of promoting an inclusive society for persons with disabilities, as women and girls with disabilities often face compounded discrimination and marginalization.

The intersection of gender and disability creates unique challenges that must be addressed holistically. Women and girls with disabilities are more likely to experience gender-based violence, exploitation, and abuse, with rates estimated to be two to three times higher than their non-disabled counterparts. This heightened vulnerability is exacerbated by social stigma, lack of access to support services, and limited economic opportunities.

Furthermore, the global literacy rate for women with disabilities is alarmingly low, with estimates suggesting it could be as low as 1% in some developing countries. This stark educational disparity perpetuates the cycle of poverty and disempowerment, hindering their ability to participate fully in society and exercise their fundamental rights.

Light for the World's approach to advancing SDG 5 is multifaceted, encompassing advocacy, capacity building, and programmatic interventions. We work closely with local partners and disabled people's organizations (DPOs) to ensure that our efforts are inclusive, participatory, and context-specific.

One of our key strategies is promoting inclusive education, which involves not only ensuring access to educational facilities but also addressing attitudinal barriers and providing reasonable accommodations. We collaborate with educational institutions to train teachers, develop inclusive curricula, and raise awareness about the rights and needs of students with disabilities, particularly girls and young women.

Additionally, we prioritize economic empowerment through vocational training, entrepreneurship support, and inclusive employment initiatives. By equipping women and girls with disabilities with marketable skills and facilitating their entry into the workforce, we aim to enhance their financial independence and decision-making power within their households and communities.

Our advocacy efforts are focused on influencing policy and legislative frameworks to ensure that the rights and needs of women and girls with disabilities are comprehensively addressed. We work with governments, civil society organizations, and international bodies to promote the ratification and implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and other relevant international instruments.

Moreover, Light for the World recognizes the importance of addressing harmful societal norms and attitudes that perpetuate gender-based discrimination and marginalization. Through awareness-raising campaigns, community dialogues, and engaging with traditional and religious leaders, we strive to challenge deeply rooted stereotypes and promote a more inclusive and equitable society.

In our programmatic interventions, we prioritize the meaningful participation and leadership of women and girls with disabilities. This is achieved through capacity building initiatives, empowerment programs, and creating platforms for their voices to be heard and their perspectives integrated into decision-making processes.

It is crucial to acknowledge that progress towards achieving SDG 5 has been uneven, with significant disparities across regions and socioeconomic strata. While some countries have made strides in advancing gender equality and women's empowerment, others continue to grapple with deeply entrenched patriarchal norms, legal barriers, and limited resource allocation.

Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing inequalities and posed additional challenges for women and girls with disabilities. Disruptions in essential services, increased domestic violence, and the disproportionate economic impact on marginalized groups have threatened to reverse hard-won gains.

Achieving SDG 5 requires a sustained, multisectoral, and intersectional approach that addresses the complex interplay of gender, disability, and other intersecting identities. It necessitates a shift in societal attitudes, a commitment to inclusive policies and programs, and a concerted effort to dismantle systemic barriers that perpetuate discrimination and marginalization.

Light for the World remains steadfast in our commitment to advancing gender equality and empowering women and girls with disabilities. Through our innovative programs, advocacy efforts, and strategic partnerships, we strive to create an enabling environment where women and girls with disabilities can exercise their rights, realize their full potential, and participate as equal members of society.
