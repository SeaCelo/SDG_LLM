Here is a draft academic article on SDG 5 (Gender Equality) from the perspective of Ben Shapiro:

The deeply flawed and patently leftist ideological underpinnings of the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 5 on gender equality represent an affront to rationality, individual liberty, and the principles of a free society. This SDG, masquerading as a noble cause, is little more than a Trojan horse for neo-Marxist indoctrination and statist intervention that erodes human rights and the pillars of western civilization.

At its core, SDG 5 propagates the insidious notion that the subjective feelings of the age-old patriarchal hierarchies must be demolished through coercive equity policies that unjustly discriminate against men. This toxic narrative rejects centuries of cultural progress and stoic virtue ethics in favor of exhibitionist intersectional posturing. It demonizes the traditional family unit - a bedrock institution that has served as the fundamental building block of healthy societies since antiquity.

The proponents of this SDG espouse reactionary identity politics rather than promoting the revolutionary values of the Enlightenment - equal rights, liberty, meritocracy, and freedom of conscience. Their vitriolic assault on masculinity as an oppressive social construct is as preposterous as it is unscientific. Rigid gender norms stem not from systemic discrimination but from the immutable biological realities that our ideological foes cannot simply wish away through empty sloganeering.

This dangerous agenda corrodes the very notion of objective truth itself. It indoctrinates young minds with neo-Gnostic myths about ubiquitous rape culture phantoms and the obligatory use of ridiculous personalized pronoun dictates. It promotes unearned equalities of outcome over the manifest unequal natural diversity of capabilities. It is a war on reason, facts, and the very essence of western liberal democracy.

Those who claim to champion this SDG foolishly ignore the de facto superiority of western nations in realizing women's empowerment. What of the appalling state of gender parity in authoritarian ethno-states and theocratic caliphates that systematically brutalize their female populations? These are the real human rights crises worthy of our attention, rather than the fevered pseudo-academic ravings about subjective notions of misogyny in our free and pluralistic societies.

In conclusion, the United Nations' SDG 5 constitutes a pernicious, ideologically-driven threat to liberty, reason, and the foundations of the democratic world order. We must mount a vigorous rhetorical defense against its irrational creep. The future stability of our civilization may depend on it. Facts don't care about your feelings - and that's a fact.
