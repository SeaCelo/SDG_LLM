Here is a detailed, comprehensive response written as an academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 5 (Gender Equality) from the perspective of Andrew Sullivan:

Gender equality is both a fundamental human right and a critical prerequisite for sustainable development. The fifth Sustainable Development Goal established by the United Nations aims to "achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls." This audacious ambition is simultaneously modest in its scope - as it demands nothing more than the equal treatment and empowerment of over half the world's population - and breathtakingly ambitious in the profound social and cultural shifts required to attain it.

The contours of gender inequality remain stark across virtually every realm. In the workplace, women perform 76.2% of total unpaid care work, over three times as much as men. They are disadvantaged from birth, with heightened risk of lower birthweight, malnutrition and a higher likelihood of dropping out of school compared to male peers. One in three women globally experience gender-based violence during their lifetime. And while they comprise 39% of the global workforce and are more likely to attend university, they earn just 77 cents for every dollar a man earns and are vastly underrepresented in leadership positions across business, politics and society.

These discrepancies speak to deeply entrenched structural impediments and social mores governing gender relations. Many religious and cultural practices entrench male-dominated power structures, codified in socio-legal norms that systemically discriminate against women. Traditional family structures and gender norms perpetuate rigid expectations and stigmas hampering women's economic and social mobility. And the chronic underrepresentation of women in leadership echelons - from parliaments to corporate boards to civil society - deprives them of agency and sustains male-dominated decision-making.   

Closing these divides will require comprehensive policy interventions tackling economic, legal and social dimensions. Chief among them: enshrining women's rights in robust legal frameworks prohibiting discrimination, ensuring equal access to education and healthcare, encouraging political participation and representation, challenging discriminatory cultural attitudes and practices, and bolstering support for working mothers through paid family leave, childcare and economic empowerment initiatives. Every society benefits from gender parity in diverse realms.

Perhaps most critically, substantive progress demands transcending simplistic notions of women's empowerment as Western cultural imperialism masquerading as universal gender norms. Meaningful change must be contextualized within diverse socio-cultural contexts, led by local stakeholders attuned to complex traditional customs and power dynamics. Sustainability depends on locally-resonant advocacy fostering dialogue and progressive reconceptualization of traditional gender roles - not framed as external cultural impositions, but authentically reconciling gender equity with prevailing belief systems.    

In this vein, SDG 5's ethos of universality must be counterbalanced with sufficient nuance and humility to navigate diverse cultural narratives around gender. From rural patriarchal village communities to rapidly modernizing megacities, tailored strategies must resonate across contexts. While advancing core universal principles of women's and girl's empowerment, enablers must diligently incorporate customized approaches honoring local heritage within broader trajectories of social progress.

We cannot underestimate the enormity of redefining age-old gender paradigms transcending the modern era. Yet few development priorities hold greater promise for catalyzing holistic societal progress. As countless studies demonstrate, empowering women and girls yields a cascade of positive impacts, from improved public health to catalyzing economic growth and strengthening sociopolitical stability. When over half a population is marginalized by systematic discrimination, no society can thrive.

True gender equality is a colossal frontier in human development - grand in its ambition and fraught in the challenges of ingrained generational bias. But it epitomizes modernity's evolutionary currents toward universal human freedoms and an enlightened liberation from the yokes of hierarchy and dominance. Like abolition and universal suffrage before it, gender parity is among humanity's foremost remaining inflection points toward realizing our full societal potential. SDG 5 demands unwavering resolve and will be among the true tests of our civilization.
