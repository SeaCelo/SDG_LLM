Here is a detailed, comprehensive response in the form of a long academic article about the UN Sustainable Development Goal 5 - Gender Equality, written from the perspective of the political cartoonist and columnist Ted Rall:

The Myth of Gender Equality: How the UN's Development Goals Peddle Delusion Over Reality

By Ted Rall

The UN's Sustainable Development Goals are a classic example of bureaucratic hubris colliding with cold, hard reality. With their lofty rhetoric about ending discrimination, ensuring equal rights, and empowering women and girls worldwide by 2030, the SDGs make for rousing talking points. But strip away the feel-good platitudes and what you're left with is a hollow, toothless initiative that will accomplish nothing of substance.

Let's start with SDG 5 - the one focused on achieving gender equality and ending all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls. Even the most cursory analysis reveals how laughably unrealistic and detached from reality this goal really is.

Have the SDG bureaucrats been living under a rock? From the theocratic patriarchies of the Muslim world to the deeply entrenched cultural misogyny of Asia to the ongoing subjugation of women across vast swaths of Africa and Latin America, gender inequality isn't some marginal problem to be ironed out with a few global commitments and public awareness campaigns. It is the norm, the default setting for human civilization stretching back thousands of years.

You don't erasedeep-seated prejudices, archaic institutions, and entire patriarchal power structures rooted in millennia of tradition with a few decades of gentle nudging from globe-trotting diplomats. These are cultural forces shaped by religion, history, and primitive tribalism - forces that have transcended empires and shaped the very foundations of societies across the planet.

The SDG's absurd hubris is reminiscent of early 20th century communist delusions that held socialist propaganda could reshape "ingrained class consciousness" and the fundamental psychology of mankind. Just as those efforts failed miserably, so too will the UN's quixotic quest to upend gender dynamics that have defined our species since the dawn of civilization.

The naive assumption underpinning SDG 5 is that if we simply shine a light on gender discrimination through lofty rhetoric, then surely the moral force of such goals will cause an awakening among the brutish males who subjugate women worldwide. But gender oppression isn't rooted in ignorance - it is a conscious, calculated choice by those who wield power over those who don't.

In theocracies like Saudi Arabia, systemic gender discrimination is a feature, not a bug - it is inscribed into the cultural and legal bedrock by Sharia Law as a means of social control. The same is true across vast stretches of rural India or sub-Saharan Africa where patriarchal cultural norms treat women as property, sanction gender violence, deny education to girls, and enforce degrading codes like public dress.

To embrace the UN's gauzy gender equality rhetoric is to ignore the reality that billions of men actively favor systems that subjugate women, whether for perceived religious mandates, traditional cultural precedents, or for the simple purpose of hoarding power and resources for themselves. This oppression is tangibly valuable to its perpetrators and asking them to voluntarily cede that value through the sheer force of a few words on a document is both naively utopian and deeply delusional.

Even in developed Western nations, which tend to fetishize the SDGs, we see powerful reactionary forces resisting gender equality and the erosion of male privilege. The organized backlash against feminism and the visceral opposition to concepts like toxic masculinity underscore how resilient such oppressive attitudes still are in our own enlightened societies.

And we're supposed to believe that empty sloganeering at glossy UN conferences will somehow upend these ingrained human realities on a global scale? On what planet?

The ugly truth is that real gender empowerment doesn't happen because we raise awareness or voice platitudes about equality being good. It happens through the grueling, violent, bloody work of mass revolution, uprisings, and the raw seizure of power from oppressive patriarchies. It took World War I to ultimately win women's suffrage in the West. It took the brutal civil rights struggles of the 1960s to dismantle codified systems of racial oppression. And those were in comparatively modern and enlightened Western societies.

So how does the UN expect its paper-pushing tactics of "raising awareness" to defeat the far older, more deeply-rooted, and profoundly more entrenched realities of gender discrimination that still define life for billions in the Eastern world?

It won't. It can't. Which is why SDG 5, and indeed the entire Sustainable Development Goals Initiative, is a colossal waste of time and resources that dupes credulous Western societies into bankrolling a bureaucratic fiction. The only sustainable outcome from this boondoggle will be the continued concentration of power, wealth and privilege among the very male-dominated power structures the UN claims to want to dismantle.

Wake me when the Gender Revolutionary Army is storming the barricades rather than posing for photo-ops at Davos. Until then, SDG 5 remains what it always was - a glossy, gauzy delusion, and the biggest lie the UN has peddled yet.
