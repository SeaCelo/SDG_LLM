Here is a detailed, comprehensive academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 5: Gender Equality, as if written by economist Joseph E. Stiglitz:

The pursuit of gender equality represents one of the most profound and consequential challenges facing the global community as we strive toward a more just, equitable and sustainable world. As the 5th Sustainable Development Goal articulates, achieving gender equality and empowering women and girls is not merely a moral imperative, but a fundamental prerequisite for alleviating poverty, bolstering economic growth, and catalyzing social development writ large.  

The societal and economic marginalization of women remains an intractable reality that transcends cultures, geographies and income strata. From lack of access to education and healthcare to workplace discrimination and under-representation in leadership roles, the subjugation of the female half of humanity constitutes a staggering abdication of human potential and economic dynamism. This systemic disenfranchisement carries severe ramifications at both the individual and macroeconomic level.

At its core, gender inequality represents a grotesque market failure – an inefficient allocation of human resources that imposes enormous opportunity costs on economies and societies. By circumscribing the rights and liberties of women, patriarchal norms and discriminatory practices erect artificial constraints on their participation in the labor force and broader economic affairs. This arbitrary exclusion curtails economic output and productive capacity, while fortifying structural inequalities that beget inter-generational cycles of disadvantage.

The dividend from women's economic empowerment is unambiguous. A study by the McKinsey Global Institute estimated that achieving gender parity in labor force participation could yield a 26% boost to global annual GDP by 2025 – a prize of $28 trillion. In developing countries, eliminating gender barriers in areas like education and financial services could potentially increase per capita incomes by over 15%. These gains underscore the transformative impacts that could accrue from dismantling the antiquated precepts, policies and prejudicial behaviors that relegate women to subordinate standing.

However, redressing gender inequality transcends the calculus of purely economic incentives. It strikes at the foundations of human development and the expansion of substantive freedoms – an ethos espoused by economist Amartya Sen and the Human Development Index. How can we claim to inhabit societies grounded in justice, equity and respect for human dignity when half the population is systematically deprived of basic liberties? The persistence of gender-based violence, unequal property rights, lack of political representation and constrained autonomy over health decisions represent pernicious impediments to the genuine freedoms that allow individuals to lead lives they have reason to value.

Of course, the amelioration of gender discrimination remains an immense undertaking given its profoundly entrenched character. Social norms and patriarchal attitudes are obdurate constructs, reinforced over centuries of dogma and institutional perpetuation. Upending such deeply rooted prejudices necessitates a holistic, multi-faceted endeavor bridging policies, laws, public advocacy, private sector engagement and perhaps most critically, a grassroots mobilization that confronts retrograde cultural mindsets at their core. Empowerment of women through increased access to education, productive employment, financial instruments and leadership fora is a vital catalyst for catalyzing this societal metamorphosis.

Moreover, gender equality epitomizes the notion of positive complementarities across the Sustainable Development Goals. Its realization would yield corollary progress toward reducing poverty and hunger, improving health and education outcomes, fostering inclusive economic growth, and cultivating peaceful, just societies. At the vanguard of sustainable development lies the fundamental recognition that these challenges are inherently interlinked – a acknowledgment that emancipation of the world's women is both a prerequisite and powerful multiplier for the entire SDG agenda.

Ultimately, the journey toward a more egalitarian world represents a multi-generational undertaking, one marked by arduous structural transformations, reformed legal frameworks, and above all, a deeper evolution in human consciousness. It requires transcending the archaic biases and outmoded mentalities that inhibit our collective flourishing. The path will be an inexorable struggle against inertia and entrenchment, but one that avails boundless prospects for socioeconomic renewal. For in uplifting the rights, autonomy and boundless potential of half the world's population, we catalyze a chain reaction of progress toward the grander ambition of truly sustainable development for all.
