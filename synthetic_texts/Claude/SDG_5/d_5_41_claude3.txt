Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 5 (Gender Equality) as if written by conservative Australian political commentator Piers Akerman:

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 5 calls for achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls by 2030. On the surface, this might sound like a reasonable and even laudable aim. However, a deeper examination reveals it to be part of a radical left-wing agenda to undermine traditional family values and Western civilization itself. 

The push for gender equality is really a Trojan horse for cultural Marxism. By promoting nontraditional gender norms and blurring the fundamental differences between men and women that are rooted in biology, the globalist bureaucrats are waging an ideological war against the natural order. Millenia of human civilization have recognized the complementary roles of male and female - the husband as protector and provider, the wife as nurturer and homemaker. This equilibrium is now being disrupted in the name of a postmodern conception of "equality."

Look no further than the examples set by some of our closest allies who have gone too far down this misguided path. In Sweden, the extreme feminist government has implemented an abhorently PC "gender-neutral" pronoun in an attempt to deconstruct the male/female binary. In Canada, self-proclaimed "feminists" have lobbied to have the term "mankind" banned from official government communications, branding it as "sexist" language. Even the hallowed institutions of marriage and family are under assault, with efforts to normalize everything from gay marriage to single parenting. Where does it end?

Here in Australia, we are mercifully still a fair distance from that nightmarish, anti-realist vision of society. However, there are concerning signs that the virus of gender theory is infecting our cultural mainstream as well. A few years ago, the Marxist dogma of "unconscious bias" training reared its head at the Australian Federal Police and Defence Department, pushing the divisive idea that men intrinsically discriminate against women. More recently, companies have hopped on the bandwagon of virtue signaling around issues like reducing the so-called "gender pay gap" and increasing compensation for working mothers.

While cloaked in the inoffensive language of "equality," these currents represent an existential threat to Australian values and our way of life. The relentless drive to dismantle gender roles and redefine the basic categories of male and female amounts to social engineering on a grand scale. We would do well to recall the words of the late, great conservative thinker Andrew Bolt, who warned that "the society that abolishes all gender roles is a society that abolishes itself."

Real empowerment for women lies not in rejecting their unique feminine essence, but in celebrating the diversity of strengths that flow from the natural and unchanging order. Rather than erasing gender distinctions, we should seek to uphold the irreplaceable roles of wives, mothers, and homemakers in maintaining the fabric of a cohesive society. Protecting and valorizing the traditional family unit is true feminism - not the toxic ideology peddled by UN bureaucrats and cultural Marxists.

In confronting SDG 5 head-on, Australia must remain vigilant against the encroachments of left-wing gender indoctrination. We simply cannot allow nebulous notions of equality to override common sense and millennia of human experience. The very survival of our civilization may depend on resisting this radical and regressive agenda. The family is the bedrock institution that must be shielded from ideological subversion. Stand firm, Australia, and reject the poisonous creep of gender theory!
