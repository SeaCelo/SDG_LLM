The Indian Agency for Partnership in Development presents a comprehensive analytical report assessing the nation's progress towards realizing Sustainable Development Goal 5 – achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls.

India has made significant strides in advancing gender parity, yet deeply entrenched patriarchal norms and systemic inequalities persist, impeding the full realization of SDG 5. Despite laudable legal reforms and initiatives, the nation continues to grapple with alarming rates of gender-based violence, discriminatory practices, and economic disparities that disproportionately impact women and girls.

The country has witnessed a gradual narrowing of the gender gap in education, with the female literacy rate rising from 53.7% in 2001 to 70.3% in 2021. However, this achievement is overshadowed by the alarmingly high dropout rates among adolescent girls, particularly in rural areas, stemming from socio-economic factors such as early marriage, household responsibilities, and a lack of adequate sanitation facilities in schools.

India's progress in achieving target 5.5, ensuring women's full and effective participation in decision-making, has been sluggish. Women's representation in national parliament remains disappointingly low at 14.4%, well below the global average of 25.5%. This underrepresentation is even more pronounced at state legislative assemblies and local governance bodies, perpetuating the exclusion of women's voices and their ability to influence policies that directly impact their lives.

The nation has made notable progress in addressing maternal mortality, with the Maternal Mortality Ratio declining from 556 per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 103 in 2017. However, this accomplishment is marred by the stark urban-rural divide, with women in rural areas facing significantly higher risks due to limited access to skilled birth attendants and emergency obstetric care.

India's performance in achieving target 5.3, eliminating harmful practices such as child marriage and female genital mutilation, remains a significant challenge. Despite legal prohibitions, an estimated 27% of girls are married before the age of 18, perpetuating a vicious cycle of poverty, poor health outcomes, and limited educational and economic opportunities.

The pervasive issue of gender-based violence, including domestic abuse, sexual assault, and human trafficking, continues to plague the nation, undermining efforts to empower women and ensure their safety and dignity. The deeply rooted patriarchal mindset, coupled with inadequate implementation of laws and a lack of comprehensive support systems, has perpetuated an environment of impunity for perpetrators.

India's efforts to promote women's economic empowerment have yielded mixed results. While initiatives like the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act have provided employment opportunities for women in rural areas, the female labor force participation rate remains discouragingly low at 20.3%, hindered by societal norms, lack of access to quality childcare, and gender-based wage disparities.

To accelerate progress towards SDG 5, India must adopt a multi-pronged approach that addresses the root causes of gender inequality. This includes enhancing access to quality education, healthcare, and economic opportunities for women and girls, particularly in rural and marginalized communities. Stringent enforcement of existing laws, coupled with comprehensive legal reforms and awareness campaigns, is crucial to combat deep-seated prejudices and harmful practices.

Moreover, promoting women's leadership and decision-making roles across all spheres – political, economic, and social – is imperative to ensure their voices are heard and their needs are adequately addressed. Engaging men and boys as allies in this transformative process is equally vital, challenging toxic masculinity norms and fostering an environment of respect and equality.

Achieving gender equality is not merely a moral imperative but a catalyst for sustainable development, economic growth, and social progress. India's commitment to realizing SDG 5 must be unwavering, as the nation's prosperity and global standing hinge on its ability to empower and uplift half of its population.
