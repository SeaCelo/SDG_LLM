Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 5 (Gender Equality) as if written by economist Luigi Zingales:

Achieving Systemic Gender Equality: An Economic Imperative 

By Luigi Zingales

The insidious persistence of gender-based discrimination represents one of the most flagrant market failures confronting modern society. Despite well-established economic principles underscoring the productive superiority of meritocratic systems, entrenched power structures and cultural biases have perpetuated the wholesale underutilization of human capital along gender lines. This egregious allocative inefficiency directly subverts core tenets of competition and dynamism, hamstringing economic growth and progress on a staggering scale.  

From a rational choice perspective, taste-based discrimination against women represents a textbook violation of profit maximization, enabling more egalitarian rivals to outcompete prejudicial firms by tapping undervalued talent pools. Yet the persistence of such patently irrational behavior points to deeper institutional forces at play - an insidious principality of social constructs codifying and reinforcing the dilution of women's economic rights and opportunities across domains.  

As the groundbreaking work of Esther Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee illuminates, conventional policy interventions often fail to surmount these deeply entrenched norms and expectancies. A multifaceted, holistic strategy is imperative, encompassing simultaneous disruptions across educational, financial, technological, and legal spheres.  

Education systems encapsulate the frontline of this crusade, with generational investments required to counteract implicit biases that constrain girls' self-perceptions from a tender age. Intentionally engineered curricula and instructional methods can empower young women to persist through traditionally male-dominated academic tracks and extracurriculars, catalyzing essential skill development and self-confidence.  

Financial inclusion efforts must be strategically directed toward dismantling capital barriers that disproportionately impede female entrepreneurship across cultures. Initiatives like microfinance open vital economic gateways, but without holistic social renovations, marginal impact is effectively capped. Complementing capital access with comprehensive entrepreneurial support networks - mentoring, technological training, professional services access - can exponentially amplify economic empowerment.

Law and regulatory reform represents a pivotal sphere for catalyzing macro-level gender parity. Instituting robust employment discrimination protections, paid family leave policies, equitable property rights and inheritance laws generates profound economic dynamism, unlocking expansive productivity gains and consumer purchasing power. This legal reform crusade must be integrally aligned with vigorous enforcement mechanisms, preemptively safeguarding institutional integrity.

Beyond these focused interventions, comprehensive culture change embodies the core objective - a systematic reframing of gender roles, expectations, and ultimately self-perceptions both for women and men. Relentless, multimedia framing campaigns coupled with highly visible, prestigious leadership posts for women across economic and political spheres can progressively catalyze rapid, self-perpetuating shifts in social norms and aspirations.

Critically, such structural reforms generate exponential cross-sector reverberations, setting into motion virtuous cycles of compounded female empowerment and economic growth. Rigorously substantiated evidence highlights causal linkages between gender parity, democratized capital allocation, innovation acceleration, and elevated household and macroeconomic performance metrics. Simply put, the realization of women's full economic potential represents a rising tide capacitating universal prosperity.

Ultimately, the moral and economic imperatives merge into existential urgency. In an era defined by escalating complexity and breakneck competitive churns, capitalizing on the entire human capital universe has transcended philosophical musings, emerging as a strategic necessity. Mobilizing half the population to fulfill its highest productive capacity is a prerequisite for robust economic resilience and long-term viability within globalized markets. Those societies ardently embracing comprehensive gender equality will be poised to outcompete commensurately. The choice is systemic prosperity or accelerating stagnation.
