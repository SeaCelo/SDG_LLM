Here is a long academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 5 (Gender Equality), written from the perspective of satirical novelist Carl Hiaasen:

The Lopsided Scales of Lady Justice: A Blistering Critique of Gender Inequality 

Well, well, well. If it isn't the issue that just won't go away, despite decades of struggle, protest marches, and legislative lip service - gender inequality. As a proud Floridian man who has witnessed the rampant inequities that fester in the sweaty underbelly of this snake-infested peninsula, I feel eminently qualified to opine on this nettlesome Topic of Patriarchal Persistence.  

Let's start with a few sparkling gems from the checkered history of the women's rights movement in these United States. We had the huddled masses yearning to breathe free at the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848, angrily waving their feminine fists at the founding knuckleheads who neglected to include their kind in that quaint little document about life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 

Flash forward over half a century to 1920, when the 19th Amendment finally allowed American women to vote after being treated like decorative second-class citizens for generations. Because having an opinion is just so unsightly in a lady, or so the mouth-breathing male establishment believed at the time.

Fast forward another torturous 50-plus years to the feminist movement of the 1960s, which bravely challenged the ingrained assumption that a woman's highest purpose was birthing babies and warming up TV dinners for when the husband came home from his real job. Suddenly, the Stepford Wives were rising up against their domestic prisons, burning their underwire bras, and daring to make decisions about their own reproductive plumbing.

Which brings me to today's grim battle lines in the ongoing War on Gender Parity. Globally, women are still shamefully underrepresented in leadership roles across virtually every sector - government, business, education, you name it. Their paychecks continue to get unfairly docked compared to men in the same positions. Sexual harassment and violence against women remain horrifically widespread epidemics. And access to basic rights like maternity care, family planning services, and general control over their own bodies is still being viciously contested in many parts of the world, including more than a few backwater American states.

It's a cycle of oppression as old and intractable as the Florida Everglades - a stinking, rarefied quagmire where unchecked male privilege has been allowed to fossilize for far too long, contaminating everything in its wake. The toxic mindsets, the systemic biases, the antiquated power structures - like a trail of braided breadcrumb clues left by a demented predator.

Where are the strong-willed, clear-eyed environmental crusaders when you need them? The scourges of sexism and gender discrimination demand the same fierce activism that took down the billionaire bastards responsible for the 2010 BP oil spill catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico. Only this time, we need to rally the trooped forces against an even more prolific offender - the oppressive patriarchy itself, and its baseless subjugation of the XX chromosome across cultures, continents and centuries. 

We're long overdue for draining that fetid swamp, once and for all. The he-man thugs who denigrate, demean and devalue over half the world's population don't deserve to keep their choke-hold on society's attitudes and opportunity structures. Swing the pendulum toward true gender equity and equal respect, and you uplift all of humanity.

Maybe then, finally, Lady Justice can ditch the damned blindfold that has symbolized her impartiality schtick for far too long. I'd rather she go ahead and keep both eyes wide open, staring down the odious knuckle-draggers who still fail to grasp that equal rights and empowerment for women is not a threat to masculinity - it's a blessing to humankind. A virtuous upgrade to the antiquated operating systems that have kept the glass ceilings firmly in place.

Because here's the truth - there's nothing more dangerous than an underestimated woman who's been pushed to her limits by small-minded, insecure men who can't handle her power. Trust me, I've met the type in dark corners of the Everglades where chivalry gets buried alongside the other swamp debris. And I'll be damned if we let those idiots keep rigging the scales of justice to their pitiful advantage.
