The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5 – "Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls" – is a multifaceted objective that has profound implications for economic theory and policy. At its core, this goal challenges the traditional neoclassical economic paradigm, which has often overlooked or undervalued the contributions of women and the impact of gender inequalities on economic outcomes.

Feminist economics, a branch of economic thought that emerged in the late 20th century, has been instrumental in challenging the androcentric biases inherent in mainstream economic theory. Scholars in this field have highlighted the ways in which the unpaid care work performed disproportionately by women has been systematically excluded from conventional measures of economic output, such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This omission has led to a distorted understanding of the true sources of economic value and productivity.

The seminal work of scholars such as Nancy Folbre, Marilyn Waring, and Diane Elson has underscored the importance of recognizing and valuing the reproductive labor undertaken by women, which serves as a critical foundation for the functioning of the formal economy. By incorporating the principles of social reproduction theory, feminist economists have challenged the artificial dichotomy between productive and reproductive spheres, revealing the interdependencies and synergies between them.

Building on these insights, recent developments in economic theory have sought to integrate gender considerations more explicitly into models of economic growth and development. For instance, the "engendering" of macroeconomic models has highlighted the ways in which gender inequalities in education, employment, and access to productive resources can constrain economic growth and perpetuate intergenerational cycles of poverty and marginalization.

Furthermore, the application of behavioral economics and experimental methods has shed light on the pervasive influence of gender norms, stereotypes, and discriminatory practices on economic decision-making and outcomes. These insights have challenged the assumptions of rational choice theory and revealed the need for more nuanced models that account for the complex interplay between individual preferences, social norms, and institutional constraints.

In this context, the pursuit of SDG 5 represents a profound challenge to the traditional economic paradigm, calling for a fundamental rethinking of the way we conceptualize and measure economic progress. It demands a shift towards a more inclusive, equitable, and sustainable model of development, one that recognizes the intrinsic value of gender equality and women's empowerment, not merely as instrumental means to other ends, but as inherent components of human well-being and societal flourishing.

To achieve this goal, economic theory must actively engage with interdisciplinary perspectives, drawing upon insights from fields such as sociology, anthropology, and gender studies. It must also embrace a more holistic and nuanced understanding of human behavior, acknowledging the complex interplay between economic incentives, social norms, and institutional structures that shape gender roles and power dynamics.

Ultimately, the pursuit of SDG 5 requires a fundamental reframing of the economic discourse, one that challenges the androcentric biases that have historically characterized the discipline and embraces a more inclusive, equitable, and transformative vision of economic progress. By doing so, it holds the potential to catalyze a paradigm shift in economic theory, unlocking new frontiers of knowledge and policy innovation that can contribute to the realization of a more just and sustainable world.
