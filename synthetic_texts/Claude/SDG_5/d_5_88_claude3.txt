Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 5 (Gender Equality), written from the perspective of Jug Suraiya, a renowned Indian writer, satirist and columnist:

A Laughing Matter? The Tragicomic Quest for Gender Parity

By Jug Suraiya  

It would be remiss of me not to begin with a disclaimer about the dubious privilege of being a male commenting on issues of gender inequality. My gender itself is an implicit disqualification when it comes to an experiential understanding of the myriad indignities and obstructions faced by the other half of humanity. And yet, the folly of men has for too long been to arrogate to themselves the right to hold forth on matters in which they manifestly lack locus standi. So let me embrace this folly in the faint hope that self-parody may compensate for proprietorial overreach.

The professed goal of SDG 5 – "Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls" – is so breathtakingly self-evident in its aspirations as to render elaborate elaboration otiose. What reasoning mind could quarrel with the moral and pragmatic imperative of ending discrimination against those who represent slightly more than half the world's population? And yet, despite the admirable intent catalysed by such agenda-setting global initiatives, the battle for substantive and not merely token gender parity continues to be overwhelmingly One Struggle Forward, Two Struggles Back.

The deeply embedded prejudices of a patriarchal system that has persisted across millennia are not so easily dislodged. It is almost as though misogyny is genetically hard-wired into male psyches from birth. The 'gentle' reminders to 'behave like a man' (which is to say, to subjugate any perceived 'feminine' traits like sensitivity or emotional vulnerability) reinforce regressive gender stereotyping at an impressionably young age. Small wonder that the graduated spectrum of disrespect towards the female – ranging from condescension to contempt to the grotesquely commonplace of violence – has proved so obdurately impervious to reform.

One recalls the perspicacious insight of that Edwardian sage of paradox, G K Chesterton: "What is meant by the 'rights of women', is merely the civil and political status of one sex." A century on, these words remain mordantly relevant, particularly for vast tracts of the purportedly modern world, where the Madame's inalienable freedoms continue to be circumscribed by cultural and pseudo-religious sanction. The very countries that grandstand as paradigms of progressivism stand indicted of abject failure when it comes to closing the gender gap in crucial indices like workforce participation, pay parity, educational access, safety and security, and political representation.

Meanwhile, the 'developing' world (it would be more accurate to call it the 'philosophically regressing' world) presents an even more ruinous vista of gender discrimination: female foeticide, underage marriage, legitimized spousal abuse, unconscionable strictures on women's mobility and autonomy. The situation in my homeland of India is a micro-representation of this global malaise, with the all-too-regular eruptions of horrific violence against women countervailing any notions of the country being an emerging economic powerhouse. Our pluralistic democracy stands diminished in the face of such remorseless injustice against the nation's daughters.    

If India's example is singularly sobering, there are equally depressing samples to be found across the world, whether in the theocratic dystopias of the Middle East and parts of Africa or the more 'enlightened' precincts of the West where glib pretences of empowerment mask more deep-seated failures. Patriarchy has many pernicious exponents, and male-pattern misogyny myriad manifestations.

And yet... what is one to make of feminist voices that insist gender be seen not as a binary identity but as an expansive continuum? The emerging discourse around 'mansplaining' and 'toxic masculinity' seems replete with ironies of homogenisation on the other side of the divide. There is also an unmistakable strand of misandry (ranging from the merely contemptuous to the categorically vitriolic) that is in danger of undermining the moral ascendancy of the mission for gender equality.

Ultimately, the quest for this sacrosanct objective is too urgent to be derailed by either patriarchal obduracy or feminist dogmatism. What is needed is a more accommodating space for reasoned dialogue premised on mutual respect and understanding. The true emancipation of womankind cannot be delinked from the imperative of revisiting and revising outmoded notions of manhood. Gender equality is not a zero-sum game where one side can advance only by vanquishing the other. It is a collaborative journey towards a societal and civilizational equilibrium.  

So perhaps the injustices and anomalies of gender hierarchy deserve to be exposed through the defamiliarizing lens of comedic subversion rather than solely through the venting of grievance and rage. Those who are rendered risible may eventually recognize the folly of their prejudices. As I have long argued, it is through the ancient Sanskrit dictum of "Vinodā Prastavām" – or "Uplift, Whilst Keeping Them Laughing" – that lasting mindset reformations are achieved.

Some may opine that the epic fight for such an ideal as gender equality is far too profound to be treated with levity. To them, I would counter with the words of that ultimate iconoclast, Lenny Bruce: "Every revolutionary idea seems to evoke three stages of reaction... it is first ignored, then ridiculed, then accepted as self-evident." If the goal of SDG 5 continues to be ridiculed, it is a sign of progress – for the next stage of its realization can only be its ultimate acceptance as self-evident worldwide.
