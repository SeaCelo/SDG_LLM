Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 5 (Gender Equality) as if written by economist N. Gregory Mankiw:

The field of economics has traditionally focused on concepts like efficiency, optimization, and the allocation of scarce resources. However, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by the United Nations in 2015 brought broader humanitarian issues to the forefront, including the crucially important goal of achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls (Sustainable Development Goal 5).

From a narrow economic perspective, one could argue that gender discrimination and lack of women's empowerment is inefficient, as it prevents the full utilization of half the potential labor force and human capital in a society. However, the moral and ethical arguments for gender equality extend far beyond just economic costs and calculations of GDP effects.

There are clear economic benefits to be realized from achieving SDG 5, including higher productivity, more economic diversification, and increased labor force participation. A 2015 McKinsey Global Institute report estimated that advancing women's equality could add $12 trillion to annual global GDP by 2025. Moreover, research shows that increasing the share of household income controlled by women leads to greater investment in children's education, health, and nutrition, creating a virtuous intergenerational cycle.

However, despite the compelling economic case for women's empowerment, gender gaps stubbornly persist across both developed and developing nations. Even in my field of economics, there is a significant gender imbalance, with women making up only around one-third of Ph.D. students and holding relatively few tenured professorships at top universities. This represents an enormous pool of untapped potential.

The root causes of gender inequality are multifaceted, ranging from institutional factors like discriminatory laws and lack of legal protections, to interpersonal dynamics like gender norms, discrimination, and sexual harassment. Overcoming these barriers will require coordinated efforts across many fronts, both within households and across institutions and societies.

On an individual and household level, we know that increasing women's control over financial resources and household decision-making is one of the most reliable pathways to achieving positive development outcomes. Promoting women's education, delaying early marriage, and facilitating access to reproductive health services can help empower women and put them on more equal footing.

Nevertheless, attempts to shift long-standing cultural gender norms often face backlash or resistance. As economists, we must be attuned to how interventions can inadvertently trigger unintended consequences. For instance, conditional cash transfer programs that grant funds to women have shown success in some contexts, but have also been known to incite domestic conflicts or a backlash of men re-asserting control within households.

Thus, carefully analyzing the complex network of social, economic, and institutional factors perpetuating gender inequality through the lenses of game theory, behavioral economics, and sociological insights is crucial for designing effective policies and interventions. Top-down legal reforms must be complemented by bottom-up efforts to update social norms and shift societal mindsets.

On an institutional level, eliminating occupational segregation, enacting anti-discrimination labor laws, providing childcare support, and securing property rights for women can help level the economic playing field. The economic dividends of such measures could be substantial â€“ studies suggest that improving gender parity in employment could raise GDP by 5-20% in many developing nations.

Governments and development institutions also have an important role in systematically collecting gender-disaggregated data and funding more research to shed light on what policy interventions work and why. Too often, gender is an afterthought rather than a core part of economic modeling and analysis.

In conclusion, the moral case for achieving SDG 5 and empowering the world's women and girls is clear and unambiguous. But even from a purely economic perspective, gender equality represents an immense source of untapped productive potential, making it among the most critical ingredients for fostering sustainable economic development in the 21st century.

Just as slavery was an economically inefficient and morally abhorrent practice that held back prosperity for centuries, perpetuating gender discrimination today hampers our collective human progress and flourishing. The economics profession has an important role to play in rigorously studying and clearly communicating the steep costs of inequality and the vast benefits of women's empowerment. I look forward to more research, analysis, and advocacy around SDG 5 in the years ahead.
