Here is a long academic article about SDG 5 (Gender Equality) in the humorous style of Dave Barry:

Ladies and Gentlemen of the Academic Industrial Complex, I come before you today to discuss a topic of grave importance that is causing massive controversy and heated debates across faculty lounges from Cambridge to Cal Tech - the idea that women are human beings.

I know, I know. It sounds utterly insane. Next I'll be claiming the Earth orbits the Sun or that fire is hot. But hear me out. There is mounting evidence building from various academics that members of the female gender — let's call them "women" — should have the same basic rights, opportunities, and headache-inducing hassles as males.

This radical notion that females are not, in fact, decorative objects designed solely to wear tiny garments and look befuddled in beer commercials is gaining steam. A cabal of gender researchers is citing obscure "data" from "facts" and even making the outrageous claim that women have capabilities beyond applying makeup and making sammiches.

These rogue co-ed profs point to developing nations where young girls are denied access to schools, robust salaries, and elected Doge positions. There are even regions of the globe where the primary vocation for women involves heavy labor, child-rearing, and enduring household chores like "gathering water" and "hauling firewood for miles." To which I say: No way! Really? Women aren't supposed to do stuff like that?

This movement further alleges that even in major cities across the developed world, men make more income than women for the same work. They cite wildly divergent pay scales in fields from medicine and law to blogging semi-coherently about the Miami Dolphins. Madness! How can this be happening in enlightened nations where women have been legally recognized as human since... (shuffles notes)... the 20th century? 

As if that's not enough upheaval for one article, this cabal wants to put an end to pernicious practices like human trafficking, forced marriages of children, denying inheritance rights, and somehow "empowering" women in the global workforce. Are they mad?! 

Respected academics are proposing nothing short of a total gender equality revolution - a world where females are granted the same autonomy and life choices as males. A reality where women control their own bodily functions, free from coercion, violence, or subservience to a patriarchy. It's madness I tell you! Pandemonium!

What's next? Letting them wear pantsuit? Read maps? Forget jokes, these people aren't kidding around.

So let me leave you with this: While I cannot endorse full-scale experiments in gender equivalence, if even a fraction of the assertions about female potential prove accurate... we males best watch our backs. Because a world where women call the shots could turn society upside down and make objects on the resume obsolete.

I'm just saying, we ought to nip this SDG 5 business in the bud before women read this article and get any crazy ideas about running Fortune 500 companies or stunt choreographing Jacki Chan films. Because Lord knows where that path leads...
