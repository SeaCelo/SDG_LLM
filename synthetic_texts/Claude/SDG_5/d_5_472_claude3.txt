Here is a detailed newspaper article about Sustainable Development Goal 5 (Gender Equality), drafted as if written for Fortune magazine:

Unlocking Economic Growth by Closing the Gender Gap

For decades, gender inequality has persisted as a persistent barrier to unlocking the full economic potential in societies around the world. However, emerging data underscores how achieving gender parity is not just a matter of human rights and social justice, but also a critical driver of economic prosperity. 

The Sustainable Development Goals, adopted by all United Nations member states in 2015, placed gender equality at the heart of the 2030 Agenda with SDG 5. This goal calls for ending all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls, ensuring their equal opportunities for leadership across all spheres, and promoting their economic empowerment through equal rights and access to resources.

A growing body of research illustrates the immense gains that can be realized by closing gender gaps. According to analysis by the McKinsey Global Institute, advancing women's equality could add $12 trillion to global GDP by 2025. The International Monetary Fund estimates that closing the gender gap in workforce participation could raise GDP in the United States by 5%, in the United Arab Emirates by 12%, and in Egypt by a staggering 34%.

"Gender equality is an issue that impacts competitiveness as much as any other factor in today's global markets," says Sarah Iqbal, Program Director at the World Economic Forum. "By failing to capitalize on the capabilities and talent of half the population, economies are undercutting their own productive potential."

Indeed, investing in women yields a "multiplier effect" that fuels wider economic growth and positive social impacts. Studies show that women reinvest up to 90% of their income in their families and communities, driving improvements in child health, education, and household wealth that compound across generations.

Yet despite this compelling economic case, deep challenges persist worldwide. The World Bank estimates that over 2.7 billion women are legally restricted from having the same choice of jobs as men. Globally, women perform 2.6 times more unpaid care and domestic work than men. And while female educational attainment has improved, this has not translated into proportional gains in leadership roles or income levels across most sectors.

Leading companies are increasingly recognizing that achieving SDG 5 and empowering women is not just good corporate citizenship, but a strategic business imperative. Innovative policies and practices that invest in women's advancement throughout their career lifecycles – from recruitment and retention programs to leadership development tracks – can unlock immense returns.

"Having a diverse and inclusive workforce isn't just the right thing to do, it's a competitive necessity in today's war for talent," explains Lorraine Hariton, President and CEO of Catalyst, a global nonprofit focused on accelerating progress for women through workplace inclusion. "The companies that successfully attract, develop and retain women will be the ones positioned for greatest success in the decade ahead."  

From boardrooms to factory floors, underutilized "womenomics" may represent one of the greatest remaining frontiers for generating sustained economic growth worldwide. As the business case for gender equality grows clearer, achieving SDG 5 should be recognized as an unparalleled investment opportunity that promises a better working world for all.
