Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 5 (Gender Equality), written from the perspective of Brendan O'Neill:

The Feminist Myth of Gender Inequality
By Brendan O'Neill

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 5 — the achievement of gender equality and empowerment for all women and girls — represents a disturbing fundamentalism that has become entrenched within elite circles. This cynical campaign to problematize the relationship between men and women and recast it as one of systematic oppression and inequality is perhaps the most regressive ideology of our time.

At its root, SDG 5 rests on the prevailing feminist myth that women globally are held back, abused, and treated as second-class citizens by an overarching culture of misogyny and patriarchal dominance. This revisionist narrative could not be further from the truth. In the modern Western world, women have never been more free and more advantaged across every sector of society. They outperform men academically, are more likely to attend university, and have greater employment prospects in many fields. Discrimination against women is illegal and widely scorned.  

And yet adherents to the dogma of SDG 5 treat this unprecedented progress as mere window-dressing, conveniently overlooking the immense social and economic advancement of women over the past century. They arrogantly declare "gender inequality" to be one of the burning injustices of our era, using inflammatory claims about a "patriarchal crisis" to justify an array of draconian policies and interventions that do vastly more harm than good.

Take the UN's perverse focus on eliminating so-called "gender-based violence." By cynically medicalizing domestic disputes and interpersonal conflicts as indicators of systemic oppression, this unenlightened initiative only further obstructs dialog and deepens gender divides. Its regressive promotion of carceral "solutions" that seek to swell the ranks of the prison-industrial complex for extremely subjective offenses reveals the authoritarian underpinnings of the entire SDG agenda.

Or consider the UN's obsessive fixation with achieving "gender parity" and equal representation across all fields and institutions. This quasi-Marxist fantasy of enforced equality of outcome lays bare the economic illiteracy and utter disregard for merit and personal freedom inherent in the SDG program. Market forces and innate differences in abilities and vocations between the sexes are sneered at while heavy-handed social engineering and top-down quotas are treated as self-evident goods. This undemocratic assault on the free choices and aspirations of women represents a perverse return to the antiquated paternalism SDG 5 claims to counteract.

Unsurprisingly, the disastrous consequences of this divisive ideology are plain to see across the global community. The developing world has suffered immensely from the implementation of these failed Western feminist dogmas. Economically fragile nations like Rwanda have been pressured into enshrining destructive gender quotas for political representation, further destabilizing already volatile societies. The vain obsessions of the UN's gender commissars have taken priority over more pressing development needs, to the detriment of men and women alike.

Meanwhile in the West, once-proud institutions like universities and corporations have become little more than reeducation camps for this secular creed, mandating insipid gender indoctrination sessions and "unconscious bias training" as intrusive and authoritarian loyalty tests. To voice reasoned disagreement with any aspect of the regime's current orthodoxies around sex and gender invites social and professional ostracization. Independent thought has become heresy.

It is telling that even the tiniest deviations from these radical gender diktats provoke overwhelming outrage. The surest sign of a religion is its fear of dissent and hostility to free expression. Criticism of transgressive rhetoric codes, discriminatory affirmative action practices, or dubious statistics around the "gender wage gap" is shouted down as blasphemy, with heretics threatened with economic exile.

For too long, too many have remained silent in the face of the intolerant rise of this anti-human faith. It is long past time to reclaim Enlightenment values, dismantle the intellectual architecture of SDG 5, and restore reason, freedom, and true equality to the relationship between the sexes. This egalitarian future is only possible by rejecting the divisive, self-serving agenda of the feminist elites who have hijacked the noble principals of gender equality in service of an authoritarian, misguided crusade.
