Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 5 (Gender Equality), written from the perspective of Leslie Cannold, a prominent Australian scholar of gender issues:

The pursuit of gender equality is both an ethical imperative and a strategic priority for the advancement of all humanity. As we progress deeper into the 21st century, it has become abundantly clear that empowering women and girls represents one of the most transformative and catalytic forces for positive change across the full breadth of the Sustainable Development Goals.

At its core, SDG 5 calls for the eradication of all forms of discrimination, violence, and harmful practices against women and girls worldwide. However, its ambition extends far beyond a defensive stance against overt injustices. This goal envisions a world where true equality is achieved – a world where women have equal rights to economic resources, access to ownership and control over land and assets, and full participation in political, economic and public life. 

The imperative of gender equality intersects with virtually every aspect of sustainable development and societal wellbeing. For example, study after study has demonstrated that increasing women's access to education drives economic growth, improves child nutrition, reduces risks associated with pregnancy, and raises lifetime earnings potential. Simply put, educating girls is a pivotal force multiplier with reverberating benefits.

Similarly, increased participation of women in the workforce is positively correlated with GDP growth rates, corporate profitability, and labor productivity. According to the World Economic Forum, equalizing employment opportunities for women could boost global wealth by trillions per year. The exclusion or underutilization of women's talents imposes an economic deadweight loss that the world can ill afford.

Perhaps even more fundamentally, gender equality is inextricably linked to the battle against global poverty. Women bear a disproportionate burden of the world's poverty, with far higher vulnerability to malnutrition, disease, and economic disadvantage. Entrenched discrimination and lack of autonomy only exacerbate this vicious cycle. By contrast, female empowerment and enhanced economic participation serves as a powerful circuit-breaker against intergenerational poverty.

In assessing obstacles to SDG 5, one unavoidable scourge is the pervasive gender-based violence that afflicts women worldwide – in the home, workplace, online spaces, and in zones of armed conflict. Violence, harassment, and abuse shatter lives, disrupt livelihoods, and impose massive societal costs in treatment, law enforcement and lost productivity. Challenging the cultural norms, institutions, and practices that enable such violence must be a top priority.  

Additionally, the burden of unpaid domestic and care work falls disproportionately on women and girls, constraining their education and career prospects. Gender roles and expectations that consign women to the home front undermine their self-determination and upward economic mobility. Resolving these inequities through progressive legislation, workplace policies, and infrastructure investments will go a long way toward realizing SDG 5's vision.

Ultimately, the quest for gender equality must be framed as a moral cause célèbre that benefits all of humanity, not just women and girls. It is an indispensable ingredient in the fight against injustice, poverty, authoritarianism, and environmental degradation. By liberating the constrained potential of half the world's population, we unlock boundless dividends in human development and societal progress.

While the challenges are immense, striving toward the universally transformative goal of gender equality must be a pivotal priority for all nations, institutions, and individuals who purport to care about humanity's shared future. The path will not be easy, but the payoff of full female empowerment will reverberate across generations to come.
