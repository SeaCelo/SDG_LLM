Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 5 (Gender Equality) from the perspective of Dennis Prager:

The push for gender equality under the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 5 is a troubling example of the moral decline and misguided priorities gripping modern society. While ensuring women have equal rights and opportunities is a noble aim in principle, the way this agenda is being advanced represents a misguided attack on traditional gender roles and values that have served as the bedrock of civilized society for millennia.

At its core, the SDG 5 agenda seeks to undermine the unique and complementary strengths that men and women offer through prescriptive gender norms. The nuclear family, with a male breadwinner and nurturing mother dedicated to raising children, has been the engine of societal and moral progress since the dawn of civilization. This timeless model is being insidiously eroded by radical feminists and secular humanists seeking to blur the distinctions between the sexes.

By aggressively promoting work opportunities, political power, and personal autonomy for women, international bodies like the UN are unwittingly destabilizing the familial foundation that allowed humanity to flourish. When women are pushed into the workplace and public sphere, it deprives children of the maternal care and guidance so crucial to their development into morally upright citizens. The unique gifts women offer as child-bearers and nurturers are being subjugated to a flawed conception of equality that values career and self-actualization over family.  

Of particular concern are efforts to expand access to "reproductive health" services, a euphemism for abortion that enables the unconscionable killing of the unborn. This moral atrocity, couched in the language of "rights" and "empowerment", undermines the sacred role of women as bearers of new life. Rather than exalting and protecting this profound capability, the international community treats it as an obstacle to be circumvented through contraception and pregnancy termination.

Moreover, the relentless advocacy for "gender parity" in leadership roles across business, politics, and civil society reflects a troubling devaluation of the distinct strengths men and women offer. Male and female qualities like assertiveness, logistical thinking, nurturing, and compassion become muddled and compromised when artificial pressure for numerical equality is applied across all sectors of society. The differences that allow the genders to complement each other so fruitfully are being systematically eroded. 

Efforts to upend traditional masculine ideals like chivalry, protectiveness, and women-and-children-first ethos are dismantling the very civilizing forces that ushered humanity out of its brutish origins. The ascendant feminist dogma rails against the notion of men as guardians and providers for the family unit, denigrating these virtues as antiquated discrimination. 

In losing venerable yet distinct male and female archetypes, society loses its moral bearings and cohesion. If we continue down this misguided path of leveling differences between men and women, we risk unraveling the social fabric and wisdom distilled over centuries. This UN-led agenda, cloaked in the hollow mantras of equality and empowerment, imperils the very familial and moral pillars required for any just and ethical society to survive and thrive.
