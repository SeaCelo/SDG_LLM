Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 5 (Gender Equality), written from the perspective of renowned economist Paul R. Krugman:

Gender equality is one of the great economic challenges and opportunities of our time. The fifth Sustainable Development Goal set forth by the United Nations calls for achieving gender equality and empowering women and girls across all spheres of life by 2030. While laudable progress has been made, the path to true parity remains long and arduous. As an economist, I believe the systematic undervaluation and underutilization of women's skills represents a massive inequity and inefficiency that inflicts tremendous costs on the global economy.

The most glaring gender gaps persist in the labor force. While female participation rates have risen markedly over recent decades, women remain disproportionately relegated to lower-paying occupations and informal employment with negligible benefits or protections. The motherhood wage penalty looms as a pernicious force impeding career advancement. Women worldwide still bear the brunt of unpaid care and domestic work—a hidden subsidy enabling conventionalmarkets to function. Even in developed nations, women are over-represented in part-time roles and face significant barriers when seeking leadership positions or seats in the corporate boardroom. The leaky pipeline of female talent hemorrhages scarce skills and perpetuates the sidelining of qualified women.  

This institutionalized marginalization produces immense deadweight losses, forgone productivity, and misallocation of human capital on a colossal scale. By some estimates, achieving gender parity in economic participation could boost global GDP by $28 trillion annually. The diminished role and rights of women exert a cumulatively crippling drag on economic development and actualization of potential across nations. It represents a prime example of extraordinary negative externalities arising from entrenched social norms and market failures necessitating decisive policy intervention.

Breaking down discriminatory norms, laws, and institutional impediments suppressing female economic empowerment must be a paramount priority. Governments should support public investments enabling women's full labor participation, including subsidized childcare, parental leave policies, and initiatives promoting work-life balance. The global gender pay gap must narrow through pay transparency mandates, forbidding wage discrimination, and skills development. Appointing more female leaders can shift organizational cultures, counter implicit biases, and serve as inspirational beacons attracting talent pipelines. Extending access to financial products, property ownership rights, and productive assets catalyzes female entrepreneurship and economic independence. Donor-driven, grassroots programs fostering education and microlending can sustainably uplift women's economic standing in developing contexts.

Of course, economists must acknowledge that patriarchal power structures, social conditioning, and preference stratification underpin observed gender disparities. Encouraging attitudinal shifts dismantling discrimination through advocacy and sensitization is vital. But material policy changes are pivotal precursors for reshaping sociocultural attitudes over generational timeframes. Simply put, empowering women through sustained investments enabling economic equality forges a positive feedback loop shattering lingering misconceptions about female capability.

From a rational perspective, achieving SDG 5 and advancing women's economic participation is a phenomenal means of unlocking growth, welfare enhancements, efficiencies, and innovation on a transformative scale. It's the quintessential economic policy with near-limitless payoffs. As Adam Smith once philosophized, peace, easy taxes, and a tolerable administration of justice count as among the principal advantages derived from a well-governed society. Add to that list the emancipation and elevation of over half the human race. Gender equity is not simply a human rights imperative—it's one of the most powerful levers we possess for collective enrichment and posterity. We economists can ill-afford to persist with anemic female empowerment.
