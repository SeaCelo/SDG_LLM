Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 5 (Gender Equality) as if written by economist Joshua D. Angrist:

Gender equality is a fundamental human right and a prerequisite for prosperous, peaceful societies. Yet despite considerable progress over recent decades, gender inequality persists as a defining challenge of our time. Pervasive discrimination, entrenched social norms, and structural barriers continue to constrain the economic, social, and political empowerment of women and girls worldwide.  

The economic costs of gender inequality are staggering. Conservative estimates suggest that closing the employment gender gap could boost global GDP by $28 trillion by 2025. At the microeconomic level, abundant causal evidence points to substantial returns to increasing girls' educational attainment and delay of early marriage and childbearing. For example, my own work in Pakistan found large returns to subsidies that induce girls to remain in school. At the macroeconomic level, cross-country growth regressions identify a robust positive relationship between measures of gender equality and economic performance.  

Yet progress has been uneven. In too many countries, systematic discrimination and sexual violence remain grave threats to gender equality. Even in prosperous nations, large and persistent gender pay gaps reflect ongoing employment discrimination and the disproportionate burden shouldered by women for unpaid domestic work and childcare. Encouragingly, innovative policy designs that leverage field experiments and quasi-experimental methods offer new pathways to remedying these inequities.

Interventions that alleviate time constraints on women's labor supply offer one such approach. Through pioneering work applying randomized evaluations, researchers like Esther Duflo have demonstrated the empowering effects of labor-saving technologies like improved stoves and water infrastructure. These sorts of investments, coupled with affordable childcare and parental leave policies, can unleash virtuous cycles of employment, autonomy, and economic security for women.

Reforming patriarchal social norms represents another crucial priority. While shifts in attitudes evolve gradually, evidence shows promise in leveraging community information campaigns and intentional curriculum design to cultivate gender-equitable beliefs and behavior. Programs like the Gender Equity Movement in Schools (GEMS) deploy classroom discussions, teacher training, and behavior change curricula to foster gender-progressive values from a young age.

Progress also requires improving women's access to productive capital and economic assets. Microfinance has emerged as a celebrated tool in this regard, with prolific research applying econometric techniques to assess microcredit's impacts. However, results from India's landmark randomized lending experiment revealed more limited average impacts than previously believed. These findings underscore the importance of product design: bundling credit with complementary training, savings facilities, and agency support may be key to empowering entrepreneurial success. Innovative fintech platforms also offer new avenues for overcoming gender barriers in financial inclusion.

Strengthening women's political voice and leadership represents another key lever. Quotas for female representation in governing bodies, while philosophically contentious, offer a promising policy instrument supported by emerging evidence. Research using regression discontinuity designs – which leverage close election outcomes to approximate randomized control trials – suggests that increased female political leadership enhances investments in health and education, vital to breaking intergenerational cycles of gender inequality.

Ultimately, achieving SDG 5 requires a holistic approach that cuts across sectoral, geographic, and demographic lines. Improving data systems to enable comprehensive gender data is a crucial foundation. In parallel, we must strive to understand and dismantle the diverse, context-specific institutional, economic, and social constraints that perpetuate gender inequality's stubborn persistence. The hard-earned gains of the past must embolden our resolve for the road ahead. Gender equality is a transcendent and moral imperative - and an indispensable condition for eliminating extreme poverty and unlocking humanity's full creative potential.
