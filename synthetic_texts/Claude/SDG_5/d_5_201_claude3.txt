Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 5 (Gender Equality) from the perspective of Cal Thomas, the conservative political commentator:

The 5th Sustainable Development Goal set forth by the United Nations calls for "achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls." On the surface, this seems like a noble and worthy pursuit. After all, who could be against equality and empowerment? Indeed, the American principles of individual liberty and equal opportunity stem from the self-evident truth "that all men are created equal." However, the secular progressive agenda behind SDG 5 is troubling.

The left's conception of "equality" is rooted in an oppressor-oppressed Marxist paradigm that views Western civilization as inherently patriarchal. In this radical feminist ideology, men are the oppressors and women are the oppressed class who must be "liberated" through relentless activism and the remaking of society. This divisive narrative breeds resentment and condemnation of men and traditional gender roles, demonizing the very foundation of family that has sustained healthy cultures for millennia.

The real war on women is being waged by the modern secular Left that celebrates promiscuity, indecency, and declining moral standards. The hypersexualization of society is stripping women of their true dignity and worth. The widespread acceptance of abortion as a form of birth control is horrifically exploitive of women. And the redefinition of marriage and attempts to dismantle gender norms harm the family unit, which provides stability for women and children. 

In contrast to SDG 5's demands, biblical principles cultivate authentic freedom, value, and empowerment for women. The Judeo-Christian tradition elevated the status of women and established moral guardrails enabling human flourishing. The Scriptures speak of husbands loving and honoring their wives as co-heirs in Christ. True equality recognizes the inherent worth of all people as beings created in the image of God - not conferred by some UN directive.

Real empowerment for women in the developing world means promoting education, economic opportunity, religious liberty, and the protection of basic human rights - not peddling a leftist cultural revolution. Countries embracing Judeo-Christian values and freedom tend to cultivate the most prosperous, stable societies where women thrive as equals.

The answer is a renaissance of biblical virtues - not statist goals pushing ideological agendas hostile to faith and family. While well-intentioned people may support SDG 5, we must be wary that it could become another vehicle for secular fundamentalists to trample individual liberty, erode religious freedom, and destabilize the civilizational pillars that have empowered women for centuries.
