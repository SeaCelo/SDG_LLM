Here is a draft academic article on SDG 5 (Gender Equality) from the perspective of Janet Albrechtsen:

The Sustainable Development Goal of achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls (SDG 5) is a lofty ambition cloaked in ideological dogma that fails to align with observable reality. A rigorous examination exposes the inherent flaws and contradictions in the very premise of this agenda item.

From a biological standpoint, the binary nature of human sexuality is an immutable fact. Attempts to dismantle this fundamental truth through rhetorical constructs like "gender identity" are anti-scientific and detached from empirical evidence. Such unconventional gender theories, once confined to the fringes of academia, now ironically underpin the mainstream advocacy for SDG 5.

This regressive ideology has permeated the highest levels of global governance, with institutions like the UN becoming captive to a radical fringe demanding a rewriting of anthropological norms under the guise of "equality." Prominent figures have lamented how the, "The word 'gender' has become perverted" from its original meaning of male and female into a dogma that is impervious to questioning.  

Furthermore, the very metrics used to benchmark progress towards SDG 5 are deeply flawed. Gender parity in fields like STEM is naively pursued as an end unto itself, divorced from the free choices of individuals. If women's preferences simply don't align with socially-engineered targets, proponents will inevitably demand more heavy-handed interventions that encroach on personal liberty.

Similarly, the simplistic narrative that attributes any statistical disparities between genders as axiomatic proof of systemic oppression is intellectually bankrupt. It fails to account for a myriad of complex variables that shape human capital formation and career trajectories, many of which are cultivated through volitional choice. In free societies, diversity in ambitions and life paths should be embraced, not eliminated through coercive social engineering.

The proselytization of SDG 5 in the developing world is particularly insidious, as it seeks to disrupt traditional societies and remake them in the image of a modernist secular value system. Under the pretext of "gender empowerment", it subverts core cultural norms, often displacing long-standing family structures and hierarchies. This moral universalism fails to respect the nuances of non-Western value systems.

Fundamentally, SDG 5 rests on flawed anthropological assumptions underpinned by neo-Marxian feminist ideology that has transmuted biological differences into a perpetual constructed grievance around "gender." This has enabled a self-perpetuating advocacy machine that, ironically, reduces the very idea of gender unto itself while ensuring its animating spirit lives on as a utopian political project.

Rather than succumbing to this corrosive dogma, we should have an honest reckoning about the immutable biological realities and rich diversity of cultural perspectives when it comes to the complementary roles of male and female in society. Only through viewpoint diversity and open discourse can we formulate a balanced vision for harmonious gender relations that transcends ideological strictures. The current trajectory of SDG 5 is untenable and willonly foster conflict and societal fracturing.
