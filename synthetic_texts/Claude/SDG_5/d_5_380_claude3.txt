The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) presents this analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 5 (SDG 5), which aims to "achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls." Despite notable progress in recent decades, persistent and systemic gender disparities continue to undermine inclusive and sustainable development across the globe.

Gender equality is a fundamental human right and a catalyst for socioeconomic transformation. However, deeply entrenched patriarchal norms, discriminatory practices, and structural barriers impede the realization of this goal. Women and girls face multidimensional challenges, including limited access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities, as well as disproportionate exposure to violence, exploitation, and unequal distribution of unpaid care work.

In the realm of education, while gender parity in primary enrolment has been achieved in many regions, significant gaps persist at higher levels. Globally, only 39% of countries have achieved gender parity in tertiary education enrolment, perpetuating a cycle of disadvantage that limits women's participation in high-skilled professions and decision-making processes. Cultural biases, early marriage, and inadequate support systems contribute to these disparities, hampering the development of human capital and hindering economic growth.

The labor market remains a bastion of gender inequality. Women's labor force participation rate stands at 47%, compared to 72% for men, reflecting entrenched sociocultural norms and the disproportionate burden of unpaid care work borne by women. This translates into substantial economic losses, with estimates suggesting that closing the gender gap in labor force participation could boost global GDP by up to 26%.

Furthermore, women face significant wage disparities, earning on average 77% of what men earn for similar work, exacerbating economic insecurity and perpetuating the feminization of poverty. The concentration of women in informal, low-wage sectors, coupled with limited access to productive resources and financial services, further entrenches economic marginalization.

Violence against women and girls remains a pervasive global pandemic, with one in three women experiencing physical or sexual violence in their lifetime. This not only violates fundamental human rights but also imposes substantial societal costs, hindering productivity, undermining human capital development, and perpetuating intergenerational cycles of violence and trauma.

Achieving gender equality requires a multifaceted approach, addressing structural barriers, transforming discriminatory norms, and empowering women and girls through targeted interventions. This includes:

1. Reforming legal frameworks to eliminate discriminatory laws and policies, while promoting gender-responsive legislation and policies that safeguard women's rights and facilitate their economic empowerment.

2. Investing in quality, affordable, and inclusive education, particularly at higher levels, to equip women and girls with the skills and knowledge to participate fully in the labor market and decision-making processes.

3. Promoting women's economic empowerment through access to productive resources, financial services, and decent work opportunities, while addressing discriminatory social norms and unpaid care work burdens.

4. Strengthening institutional mechanisms and partnerships to advance gender equality, including gender-responsive budgeting, data collection, and monitoring systems.

5. Engaging men and boys as allies in challenging harmful gender norms and promoting positive masculinities.

6. Addressing intersecting forms of discrimination based on factors such as race, ethnicity, disability, and socioeconomic status, which exacerbate gender inequalities.

Achieving gender equality is not only a moral imperative but also an economic and developmental necessity. By harnessing the full potential of women and girls, societies can unlock a powerful catalyst for sustainable development, fostering inclusive economic growth, enhancing productivity, and accelerating progress across all Sustainable Development Goals.

UNCTAD calls upon all stakeholders – governments, civil society, the private sector, and international organizations – to prioritize gender equality as a cross-cutting issue, integrating gender perspectives into policymaking, programming, and investment decisions. Only through concerted and sustained efforts can we dismantle the structural barriers that perpetuate gender inequalities and unleash the transformative potential of women and girls as agents of change.
