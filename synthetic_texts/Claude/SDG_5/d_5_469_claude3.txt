Here is a detailed newspaper article on Sustainable Development Goal 5 (Gender Equality) from the perspective of an entrepreneur:

Achieving Gender Parity: The Entrepreneurial Imperative 

By Alexandra Wilkinson, Founder & CEO, Athena Strategic Ventures

As an entrepreneur, I firmly believe that gender equality is not just a moral and social imperative - it's also an economic and business necessity. The stark truth is that we cannot achieve sustainable, inclusive economic growth without empowering women and girls and ensuring their full participation across all sectors.

The statistics paint a sobering picture. Women perform 2.6 times more unpaid domestic and care work than men globally. They face discriminatory laws and lack access to economic resources in many countries. The gender pay gap persists stubbornly - women earn just 77 cents for every dollar earned by men. And perhaps most troubling, 1 in 3 women worldwide experience gender-based violence in their lifetimes.

As entrepreneurs, we simply cannot afford to ignore these realities or the immense drain on human potential they represent. Gender inequality is a systemic risk that hampers economic dynamism, stifles innovation, disrupts labor markets, and constricts our available talent pool. In fact, it's estimated that gender gaps cost the global economy a staggering $160 trillion in lost wealth due to gaps in earnings, productivity, and workforce participation.

Conversely, research shows that companies with gender diversity outperform their peers in profitability, creativity, governance, and sustainable business practices. Gender lens investing - which intentionally backs companies that embrace gender equity policies and products/services that benefit women - is an increasingly mainstream strategy yielding strong returns.

So from a purely economic standpoint, promoting gender equality is one of the most powerful accelerants for business success and market growth that entrepreneurs can leverage.

But beyond economics, achieving SDG 5 is fundamentally about human dignity, justice, and tapping into the full depth of human potential. Fulfilling the promise of gender equality means overcoming systemic biases, dismantling discriminatory laws, investing in women's education and skills training, and promoting shared responsibility for unpaid care work. It means reshaping restrictive masculine norms and power structures that enable sexual exploitation, harassment, and violence.

It means empowering women as entrepreneurs themselves - supporting their access to capital, networks, and mentorship so they can build scalable businesses and create jobs in their communities. Through my venture capital fund, I've seen firsthand how investing in female founders generates powerful ripple effects in driving progress on gender equality.

As entrepreneurs, we have both the opportunity and the moral obligation to embed principles of gender equity into the core DNA of our companies - through equitable hiring, promoting women into leadership roles, offering benefits like paid family leave, addressing bias in product design and marketing, and cultivating inclusive work cultures. We have to hold ourselves and others accountable for meaningful change.

Gender inequity isn't just a "women's issue" - it's a human issue that hampers the full economic potential and flourishing of societies. By actively promoting women's empowerment through our businesses, entrepreneurs can be catalytic agents in achieving the SDG 5 vision of a "gender equal world is a better world."

Bold, proactive leadership from the entrepreneurial community is critical to accelerating progress. So let's roll up our sleeves, leverage our innovation mindsets, and get to work driving the transformative change that builds prosperous, equitable economies of shared opportunity. The world's future prosperity depends on it.
