Here is a detailed academic article on SDG 5 (Gender Equality) from the perspective of the late economist Walter E. Williams:

The United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has rightly identified gender equality as one of its 17 Sustainable Development Goals. Too often, however, the solutions proposed to achieve this laudable aim rely on coercive government intervention and disregard the role of free markets and property rights in empowering women.  

Let's start with some tough truths. Despite the ostensible commitments to gender equality espoused by most nations, discrimination against women remains pervasive worldwide. Gender gaps in labor force participation, compensation, education, legal rights, and other areas persist across cultures. Even in the modern West, women continue facing unfair obstacles. We must confront these inequities head-on.

The vital question, however, is how best to effectuate positive change. Misguided policies relying on legislative quotas, preferential treatment regimes, and aggressive wealth redistribution won't solve the underlying issues. History has shown that such top-down solutions breed resentment, undermine meritocracy, and often worsen circumstances for the intended beneficiaries.

A far better approach recognizes how economic freedom and robust property rights foster female empowerment. Where markets are allowed to flourish with minimal government intrusion, women's entrepreneurial potential can blossom. Just look at the vast strides made by female entrepreneurs and executives in capitalist nations like the United States over the past century. 

This virtuous cycle is no coincidence. Systems prioritizing individual liberty, equal legal standing, and secure private property catalyze opportunities for all – including marginalized groups long denied equal standing. As women gain financial autonomy and accrue capital through market endeavors, their social standing and bargaining power increase commensurately.

Of course, important cultural and legal barriers must still be dismantled globally before true gender parity can be achieved. But coercive wealth transfers and preferential programs are not the answer. They undermine the very market dynamics and incentives that have proven so emancipating for women in free societies.

A wiser strategy emphasizes strengthening economic freedom worldwide while upholding neutral frameworks of laws and rights. This empowers women – and all people – to flourish through voluntary market interactions, meritocratic advancement, and capitalistic value creation. Only then can the moral imperative of ensuring equal dignity and opportunity be realized in full.

Some may criticize this approach as overly idealistic or insufficiently "progressive." But the empirical evidence is clear: Nations and cultures embracing economic liberty consistently propel greater prosperity, social progress, and emancipation of the disadvantaged over time. Those mired in stagnant, tightly controlled command economies almost invariably suffer heightened gender oppression.

Sustainable Development Goal 5 presents a vital mandate. But we must look to the right models – the liberating forces of free enterprise, property rights, and entrepreneurial dynamism – to catalyze real, lasting progress toward gender equality worldwide. Coercive redistribution and bureaucratic diktats cannot create the requisite societal transformation; only the generative powers of capitalism and voluntarism can ultimately usher in a liberated future of equal dignity for all.
