Esteemed colleagues and distinguished members of the expert community,

In this analytical report, we delve into the intricate realm of Sustainable Development Goal 5 (SDG 5), which aims to "achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls." As a leading global network dedicated to addressing the challenges of an aging population, HelpAge International recognizes the inextricable link between gender equality and the well-being of older persons, particularly older women.

The intersection of gender and age presents a complex tapestry of intersectional vulnerabilities and opportunities. Older women frequently face compounded discrimination, marginalization, and systemic barriers that impede their full participation in society. This multifaceted issue demands a nuanced and holistic approach that acknowledges the diverse experiences and realities of older women across different socioeconomic, cultural, and geographical contexts.

Globally, older women are disproportionately affected by poverty, lacking access to essential resources, income security, and social protection mechanisms. The gender pay gap, coupled with interrupted or limited employment opportunities throughout their lives, often leads to inadequate pension coverage and financial insecurity in later years. This economic vulnerability is further exacerbated by gender-based discrimination in inheritance and property rights, leaving many older women without assets or a safety net.

Moreover, older women's access to quality healthcare services remains a pressing concern. Ageism and gender biases within healthcare systems can result in inadequate screening, diagnosis, and treatment, particularly for age-related conditions and non-communicable diseases that disproportionately affect women. This disparity is compounded in low- and middle-income countries, where limited resources and infrastructure pose significant challenges.

Ensuring the inclusion and participation of older women in decision-making processes is crucial for achieving gender equality and empowerment. Their unique perspectives, experiences, and insights must be valued and incorporated into policymaking, development initiatives, and community-level programs. Encouraging their engagement not only promotes their agency and autonomy but also fosters intergenerational solidarity and knowledge exchange.

Addressing the specific needs and empowerment of older women requires a multifaceted approach that tackles the root causes of gender inequality and ageism. This includes challenging deep-rooted societal norms, stereotypes, and discriminatory practices that perpetuate the marginalization of older women. Comprehensive legal and policy frameworks must be established to protect their rights, promote their economic empowerment, and ensure their access to essential services and support systems.

Collaborative efforts among governments, civil society organizations, and private sector entities are essential to create enabling environments that foster the inclusion, dignity, and autonomy of older women. Investing in gender-responsive social protection programs, accessible and affordable healthcare services, and lifelong learning opportunities can empower older women and enhance their resilience.

Furthermore, data disaggregation by age and gender is imperative to accurately capture the intersectional challenges faced by older women and inform evidence-based policymaking and programmatic interventions. Closing the data gap will enable targeted interventions and the monitoring of progress towards achieving gender equality and empowerment for all ages.

HelpAge International recognizes the urgency of addressing the multidimensional challenges faced by older women and remains steadfast in its commitment to advocating for their rights, promoting their inclusion, and amplifying their voices. By embracing a holistic and intersectional approach, we can collectively work towards creating a more equitable and sustainable world, where the contributions and dignity of older women are valued and celebrated.
