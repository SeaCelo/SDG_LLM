From the perspective of the Chilean International Cooperation Agency, Sustainable Development Goal 5 (SDG 5), focused on achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls, represents a fundamental challenge for the sustainable development of our country and the region. Despite significant progress in recent decades, structural gender gaps persist, hindering progress toward a truly inclusive and equitable society.

In Chile, while notable advances have been made in education and female labor force participation, systemic barriers still prevent women from reaching their full potential. The gender pay gap, which hovers around 20%, reflects persistent discrimination and occupational segregation faced by women in the labor market. Additionally, the disproportionate burden of unpaid domestic and care work continues to fall on women, limiting their professional development and economic autonomy.

In decision-making spaces, although there has been a gradual increase in female leadership, cultural and structural obstacles remain that hinder equitable access to positions of power. Women's underrepresentation in political, business, and community decision-making spaces perpetuates gender biases and limits the inclusion of diverse perspectives in policymaking and development strategies.

Another critical challenge is gender-based violence, a scourge that affects women and girls of all ages and social strata. Despite efforts to strengthen the legal framework and prevention and care programs, domestic violence, sexual harassment, and other forms of violence remain a concerning reality that undermines women's autonomy, health, and well-being.

It is crucial to address these challenges with a multidimensional approach involving all sectors of society. Comprehensive public policies are required to promote equal opportunities in education, employment, and politics, as well as measures to reconcile work and family life and to eradicate social and cultural norms that perpetuate discrimination and violence against women.

Additionally, it is vital to strengthen accountability and monitoring mechanisms to ensure the effective implementation of laws and programs aimed at promoting gender equality. The collection and analysis of gender-disaggregated data are essential to identify existing gaps, monitor progress, and adapt interventions as necessary.

In this regard, international cooperation plays a key role in sharing experiences, transferring knowledge, and mobilizing resources to support national efforts on gender equality. Regional and international collaboration allows for leveraging best practices and innovative approaches while strengthening partnerships and coalitions to address common challenges.

In summary, achieving SDG 5 is imperative for the sustainable development of Chile and the region. It requires a firm and sustained commitment from all stakeholders, as well as the adoption of a transformative approach that addresses the root causes of gender inequality. Only by promoting a truly inclusive and equitable society can we fully harness the potential and contributions of all women and girls, laying the foundation for a prosperous and sustainable future for everyone.
