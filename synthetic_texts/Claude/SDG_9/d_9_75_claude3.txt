Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), written from the perspective of conservative commentator Mark Steyn:

The Dystopian Dreamscape of 'Sustainable' Development

By Mark Steyn

Once again, the great blob of transnational progressivism is demanding we sacrifice individual liberty and economic freedom on the altar of another utopian scheme - this time under the Orwellian banner of "sustainable development." Sustainable Development Goal 9 calls for building "resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization and fostering innovation." On the surface it sounds uncontroversial, even laudable. But drill down into the statist sludge of U.N.-speak, and you'll find the same corrosive hostility to free markets and constitutional democracy that characterizes the entire SDG campaign.

The very notion of the United Nations dictating the appropriate pace and pattern of industrialization is a frontal assault on the core principles of capitalism - private property rights, free flows of investment capital, and freedom of labor. Innovation is a beautifully destructive process of creative upheaval in which new ideas, methods and products continually sweep aside the old. Yet the plodding mandarins of Sustainable Development seek to centrally plan and control these spontaneous evolutionary forces - replacing Adam Smith's "invisible hand" with a tightly clenched federal fist.

Examine the rhetoric more closely. What precisely do they mean by "inclusive and sustainable industrialization?" Well, the U.N's own documents make clear this is code for giving developing nations a perpetual claim on the productivity of the industrialized west through compulsory transfers of capital, technology and resources - a real-life realization of the economic hypothesis that wrecked the Soviet Union. The Orwellian language about "resilient infrastructure" simply masks an insatiable desire to control and micro-regulate the means of production and the free movement of people, goods and services.

Just as SDG 1 seeks to redefine "poverty" to justify never-ending redistributive programs, SDG 9 radically redefines "industrialization" so that economic development becomes not a process of capital accumulation and technical progress, but a top-down regime of enforced stasis subsidized by the developed world. And all in pursuit of that most slippery and subjective of chimeras - "sustainability." It's a recipe for managed decline and civilizational sclerosis that will leave future generations to inherit a defensive crouch of lowered expectations and enforced privation.

The bitter irony is that the very innovations that made the modern world wealthy and healthy enough to lavish precious resources on combating poverty, disease and environmental despoliation are now being systematically disincentivized. By seeking to freeze the economic order of the early 21st century in place, the Sustainable Development Goals will ensure a grim Malthusian future of arithmetic stagnation in which humanity's full potential remains unrealized, and billions are condemned to marginal subsistence.

The world's poor do not need infinite tranches of climate reparations from hairshirt eco-mullahs. They need the fundamentals of liberal capitalist economy - a fair and impartial legal system, sound property rights, low taxes, light regulations, and freedom to work, invest, trade and innovate without the heavy hand of redistributive government confiscation. This vibrant, wealth-creating, planet-healing system of free human exchange has lifted billions from poverty. Only ideologues unable to countenance the embarrassing success of the free market could dream up SDG 9 - and the grisly utopian prison it portends.
