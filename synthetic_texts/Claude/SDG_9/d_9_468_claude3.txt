Here is a draft newspaper article on Sustainable Development Goal 9 (Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation), written in the style of The Economist:

The Audacity of Infrastructure

The United Nations' rallying cry to "build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation" seems a Herculean task for the 21st century. Yet Sustainable Development Goal 9 goes to the heart of humanity's boldest endeavors - erecting the physical and organizational scaffolding to propel shared prosperity.

The notion of resilient infrastructure is in itself Janus-faced. It nods to the need for robust transportation networks, utilities, and telecommunications to withstand nature's increasingly severe temper, wrought by climate change. But it simultaneously means fortifying social systems and institutions against inequality, conflicts, and fraying governance that undermine economic progress. 

Worryingly, the coronavirus pandemic has brutally exposed just how brittle much of the world's infrastructure remains in the face of systemic shocks. Creaky supply chains crumpled, digital networks groaned under frozen demand, and subpar public health systems were overwhelmed. An estimated $2 trillion is still needed annually to plug the global infrastructure investment gap.

At the same time, the crisis may shock countries into upgrading their critical assets. China's voracious post-pandemic stimulus looks geared towards high-tech megaprojects like rolling out 5G nationwide and bolstering electric-vehicle charging networks. The European Union is earmarking billions for green infrastructure, from energy-efficient buildings to hydrogen storage and sustainable transportation.

Looking ahead, smart infrastructure means future-proofing economies against escalating threats like cyber-attacks, extreme weather and faltering progress on the SDGs themselves. This requires climate-hardened structures that can withstand baking heat waves and superstorms. It means sewers and power grids designed for burgeoning urban populations. And it necessitates fiber-optic and cellular redundancy to ensure unwavering internet access, the oxygen for digital commerce and innovation.    

Inclusive industrialization, however, poses an even knottier challenge. How to spread factories, power plants and industrial capacity in a way that lifts up disadvantaged groups rather than further marginalizing them? The road is littered with failed efforts at state-led industrialization that saddled countries with debt-ridden whitephant projects. China's much-vaunted Belt and Road infrastructure plans are now being scrutinized for locking some poor nations into loans they can't repay.

For true inclusion, the industrial development playbook needs an update for the 21st century. This means taking advantage of urbanization to create compact, green cities and productive economic clusters. It means repurposing the digital revolution and automated manufacturing into ladders for upskilling workers across the income spectrum. And it demands building more nimble organizations and institutions that evolve to seize new opportunities.

To spur this revamp, innovative financing vehicles - from green bonds to public-private partnerships and corporate-driven social impact funds - will be essential. A renewed international push for market-opening global trade deals could likewise catalyze business activity. So too could accelerated patent reforms and tech-transfer mechanisms that enable the spread of productivity-boosting innovations.

Ultimately SDG9's directive aims for the moon - recasting the very physics of how people, goods, services and bright ideas move. Accomplishing that Promethean feat would radically realign the infrastructure that props up human society itself. It is an audacious goal befitting an era of smartphones and reusable rockets. The world is still waiting to see if the planetary engineering required can indeed be achieved.
