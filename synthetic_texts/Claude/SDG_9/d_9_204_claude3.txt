Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), framed as if written by the renowned conservative political columnist George Will:

A Conservative Vision for Sustainable Industrialization and Innovation

As a staunch conservative, I believe fervently in the transformative power of human ingenuity, entrepreneurship, and market forces to catalyze progress and improve lives. Consequently, I find myself surprisingly aligned with the underlying spirit of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 9 (SDG 9), which calls for building "resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization and fostering innovation." While the UN's rhetoric often leans disappointingly progressive, SDG 9 speaks to core conservative principles of self-determinism through economic dynamism. 

At its essence, SDG 9 represents an enlightened recognition that modern societies require advanced physical capital and technological prowess to thrive and uplift the human condition. The developing world's peoples deserve the immense liberating force of sturdy transportation, renewable energy grids, environmental remediation systems, and ICT connectivity, provided most efficiently by market competition and private enterprise. Only robust industrial capacity can yield the material abundance required to elevate global living standards.  

Conservatives understand that the great menace of poverty stems not from resource scarcity, but from institutional inertia and stultifying constraints on human potential. SDG 9 implicitly endorses this wisdom by directing investment into the drivers of long-term productivity gains - resilient infrastructure, sustainable industrialization, and innovative capacity. These forces empower individuals through expanded economic freedom and opportunity.

While misguided progressives obsess over income inequality as a moral crisis, discerning conservatives recognize such fleeting disparities as transitory byproducts of the perpetual capitalist churning that fuels widespread improvement. Consider the revolutionary impact of the industrial revolution, electrification, and the combustion engine - all disruptive technologies that upended incumbent orders yet propelled society into modernity. SDG 9 tacitly vindicates this dynamic view of economic "creative destruction" by championing innovation and sustainable industrial development as catalysts for elevating humanity's station.

Of course, no governance paradigm imposed through rigid central planning can supplant an organic market order and its powerful incentives. Top-down diktats suppressing market signals chronically distort investment, misallocate resources, and reward rentseekers rather than value-creators. The UN must remain cognizant that its aspirational goals can only be achieved through an ecosystem conducive to entrepreneurial risk-taking, protected property rights, and unobstructed market pricing. 

Governments' primary role should be establishing a stable institutional framework, rule of law, and reliable infrastructure to reduce operational frictions while allowing the creative forces of capitalist competition to flourish. Every nation should robustly defend intellectual property to incentivize technological innovation. Public investment in basic research and STEM education helps seed future productivity gains. Streamlined regulatory regimes ease the path from invention to scaled commercialization.

While progressives may fixate on preventing any disparities through coercive redistribution, true conservatives understand that economic growth represents the rising tide lifting all boats. An honest reckoning shows worldwide poverty plunging as industrialization and innovation empower developing societies. Those nations integrating into globalized trade experience flourishing consumer classes, life expectancies, literacy rates, and personal freedoms. 

In tandem with robust infrastructure and technology platforms, this virtuous capitalist cycle propels sustainable development - allowing modernity's wondrous improvements to reach even the most deprived regions. The genius of SDG 9 resides in its tacit deference to humanity's inexorable striving for progress through applied ingenuity. With the right catalytic conditions, the developing world will inevitably replicate the modernizing revolutions that enlightened Western industry and enterprise.
