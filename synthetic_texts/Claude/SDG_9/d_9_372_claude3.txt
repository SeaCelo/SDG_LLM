The International Organization for Migration (IOM) presents this analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 9 (SDG 9), which aims to "Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation." As a leading intergovernmental organization in the field of migration, the IOM recognizes the intrinsic link between sustainable infrastructure, industrialization, and migration patterns.

Achieving SDG 9 is pivotal in creating an enabling environment for safe, orderly, and regular migration. Robust and resilient infrastructure is a prerequisite for facilitating human mobility, enabling access to essential services, and fostering economic opportunities. Inadequate infrastructure, particularly in developing regions, can exacerbate vulnerabilities and act as a driver of forced displacement and irregular migration.

The IOM's engagement in this goal is multifaceted, spanning from promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization to fostering innovation that addresses the challenges and opportunities associated with migration. Our organization recognizes the transformative potential of industrialization in creating decent employment opportunities and generating economic growth, which can alleviate pressures that contribute to irregular migration.

However, industrialization must be pursued thoughtfully, ensuring that it is inclusive and sustainable. The IOM advocates for industrial policies that prioritize environmental sustainability, promote decent work conditions, and actively involve migrant communities. By facilitating the integration of migrants into the formal labor market, we can harness their skills, expertise, and entrepreneurial spirit, thereby contributing to sustainable industrialization.

Innovation plays a pivotal role in achieving SDG 9, and the IOM is at the forefront of leveraging innovative solutions to address migration challenges. Our organization fosters partnerships with academic institutions, technological hubs, and the private sector to develop cutting-edge solutions that enhance migration governance, facilitate remittance flows, and promote the socio-economic inclusion of migrants.

One illustrative example of our innovative approach is the development of digital platforms that facilitate skill-matching between migrant workers and employment opportunities in destination countries. These platforms not only enhance labor mobility but also contribute to addressing skills gaps, fostering knowledge transfer, and promoting inclusive economic growth.

Furthermore, the IOM recognizes the critical importance of infrastructure resilience in the face of climate change and natural disasters. Extreme weather events and environmental degradation can trigger mass displacement, straining existing infrastructure and exacerbating vulnerabilities. Through our programs, we work with governments and communities to enhance the resilience of critical infrastructure, including transportation networks, housing, and basic services, ensuring that they can withstand shocks and support the needs of both host and migrant populations.

In conflict-affected regions, the IOM plays a crucial role in supporting the rehabilitation and reconstruction of infrastructure, creating conditions conducive to sustainable returns and reintegration. Our organization collaborates with local authorities, civil society organizations, and affected communities to ensure that reconstructed infrastructure is inclusive, accessible, and responsive to the needs of diverse populations, including migrants and internally displaced persons.

The IOM's approach to achieving SDG 9 is grounded in a comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between migration, infrastructure, industrialization, and innovation. By fostering multi-stakeholder partnerships, promoting inclusive policies, and leveraging innovative solutions, we strive to create an enabling environment that unlocks the potential of migration as a driver of sustainable development, while ensuring that no one is left behind.
