Dear colleagues and sustainable development experts,

On behalf of the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID), I am pleased to present this comprehensive analysis of Sustainable Development Goal 9: "Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure." As we know, this SDG is fundamental for driving inclusive and sustainable economic growth, promoting inclusive industrialization, and fostering innovation.

Let me begin by emphasizing the crucial importance of this goal for the progress of our nations. Building resilient infrastructure, promoting sustainable industrialization, and fostering innovation are key elements for generating decent employment, increasing productivity, and achieving equitable economic growth. However, despite progress, significant gaps persist in access to basic infrastructure, particularly in developing countries.

According to the latest reports, over one billion people lack access to paved roads, and one-fifth of the world's population does not have access to reliable electricity. These disparities hinder progress and limit development opportunities. It is imperative that the international community addresses these gaps urgently and in a coordinated manner.

Another key challenge is the need to foster inclusive and sustainable industrialization. While manufacturing has been an engine of economic growth in many countries, it has also had considerable environmental impacts. It is essential to promote the adoption of cleaner and more resource-efficient industrial technologies and processes. Additionally, we must encourage economic diversification and the creation of resilient value chains that generate decent jobs and reduce excessive dependence on specific sectors.

Innovation is a fundamental pillar for achieving the goals of SDG 9. It is crucial to invest in research and development, promote collaboration between the public and private sectors, and foster an environment conducive to entrepreneurship and innovation. We must leverage disruptive technologies, such as artificial intelligence, robotics, and biotechnology, to drive productivity, efficiency, and sustainability across all economic sectors.

However, addressing existing digital divides and ensuring access to information and communication technologies (ICT) for everyone is vital. This will not only boost innovation but also promote social and economic inclusion, especially in marginalized and rural communities.

Moreover, fostering technology transfer and knowledge sharing between developed and developing countries is critical. South-South cooperation and technical assistance play a key role in this regard by facilitating access to innovative technologies and practices tailored to local contexts.

At AECID, we are committed to supporting our partners in achieving this critical SDG. Through technical and financial cooperation programs, we are working to improve infrastructure, promote sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation across various key sectors. Notable examples include:

The road network improvement project in rural Peru, which has increased connectivity and access to markets for local communities.
The sustainable textile industry support program in Bangladesh, which has introduced cleaner and more resource-efficient production practices.
The agricultural innovation promotion initiative in Mozambique, which has supported the development and adoption of innovative technologies to increase productivity and resilience in agricultural systems.
These are just a few examples of our efforts, but much work remains to be done. We need a coordinated and multidisciplinary approach that involves all relevant stakeholders, from governments and international organizations to the private sector and civil society.

Furthermore, we must address cross-sectoral challenges such as climate change, environmental degradation, and inequality. SDG 9 is closely linked to other goals, such as SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and SDG 13 (Climate Action). Only through an integrated and holistic approach can we achieve truly sustainable development.

In conclusion, SDG 9 is essential for driving economic, social, and environmental progress worldwide. Together, we must redouble our efforts to build resilient infrastructure, promote sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation. Only then can we create a more prosperous, inclusive, and sustainable future for all nations and all people.

Thank you very much for your attention and continued commitment to this important development agenda!
