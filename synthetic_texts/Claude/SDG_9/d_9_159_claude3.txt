Here is a draft academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) as if written by Thomas Friedman:

The Sustainable Development Goals lay out a blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all by 2030. But among the 17 goals, SDG 9 on industry, innovation and infrastructure is perhaps the most critical driver and linchpin for enabling the world to actually get there. Why? Because it gets at the very sinews and musculature that make the modern world possible and functional.

Think about it - without resilient infrastructure, robust industrial capabilities, and a relentless culture of innovation, the world simply could not support anything close to our contemporary population levels and standards of living. We'd be going nowhere, literally and metaphorically. The roads, bridges, railways, air transport, power grids, water/sanitation systems, digital networks - all the infrastructure that defines our civilization - rests on the industrial and technological ingenuity catalyzed by innovation.  

Indeed, innovation is truly the force majeure that has taken our species from the days of hunting and gathering to today's interconnected globe of mind-boggling complexity and productivity. It is what economists describe as the main driver of productivity growth and the "residual" factor explaining economic progress beyond just increased labor and capital inputs. The great innovations, whether the printing press, steam engine, computer, internet or whichever breakthrough you want to highlight, have been the sparks that ignited leaps in human empowerment, prosperity and possibilities.

Of course, not all innovation has been positive. Many innovations, from fossil fuels to nuclear weapons, have had devastating consequences when their negative spillovers were not properly governed or mitigated. This illustrates that innovation by itself is not enough - it needs to be purposefully harnessed and channeled in the right directions to truly be a force for good in the world. This is where SDG 9 comes in.

The goal calls for building resilient and sustainable infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and fostering innovation across all countries. In other words, it provides the compass for steering the immense powers of the modern world's infrastructure, industry and innovation onto a more sustainable, equitable and future-proof trajectory.

This means developing higher quality, more reliable, safer and environmentally-sound infrastructure systems to support economic development and human well-being with a much lighter ecological footprint. It means upgrading and retrofitting industries to be more resource and energy efficient while maximizing the use of clean technologies and industrial processes. And it means catalyzing a new wave of eco-innovations that can help solve the great challenges of our time, from climate change and environmental degradation to food insecurity, public health threats and existential risks like biodiversity collapse and nuclear proliferation.

Crucially, SDG 9 also places heavy emphasis on making industrialization inclusive and innovation accessible across the entire global community. Because the cruel paradox has been that while innovation has turbocharged human possibilities overall, huge swaths of the world's population have been bypassed by the modern industrial age or trapped on the wrong side of yawning opportunity divides. Billions lack affordable access to basic infrastructure, let alone internet or the benefits of frontier technologies like AI, biotech, nanotech, cleantech or cutting-edge manufacturing capabilities.

The digitaldivides that have opened up within and between countries and communities reveal the imperative for more equitable sharing of innovative advances. Because in today's hyper-connected world, where we are all part of these incredibly intricate supply chains, value chains and networks of mutually reinforcing progress, no one can truly thrive if large segments are left behind or cut off from the engines of innovation.

The COVID pandemic was a visceral reminder of the degree to which our fortunes are intertwined in this age of globalization. An outbreak originating from one corner of the world quickly cascaded across the entire hyper-connected planet, laying bare the fragilities and brittle points in our infrastructure backbone as well as shortcomings in industrial capacities and innovation systems for rapidly developing and disseminating vaccines, therapies and resilience strategies.

The urgency for a more robust, sustainable and equitable infrastructure-industry-innovation ecosystem could not be more apparent. That's what makes SDG 9 so vital. Because only by succeeding in building that higher-level, more advanced and inclusive version of the modern world's foundational drivers can we unlock the next greatest economic, scientific and human development gains while averting catastrophes born of cascading breakdowns and disparities.

The green industrial revolution, the cleantech revolution, the biotech revolution, the AI revolution - these are the innovation waves that must be ridden not just by some but by all countries and all people to navigate our way to a truly sustainable trajectory. We have the seeds of incredible innovations emerging, from renewable energy and smart grid technologies to synthetic biology solutions, carbon capture technologies, plant-based protein revolution and precision genetic editing capabilities. But they need to be strategically fostered, scaled up and made universally accessible through smart investments in infrastructure and forward-leaning industrial policies.

That's the great generational challenge - ensuring that the next industrial revolution, the Industry 4.0 revolution, becomes the Sustainable Development Revolution that produces not just more overall growth, but more inclusive and resilient growth that lifts all of humanity to new heights without destroying the planet in the process. It starts by achieving SDG 9 - providing the sustainability-enhancing infrastructure, the green industrialization, and the eco-innovations needed for navigating the 21st century successfully.

The alternative is a more fractured world of have and have-not societies, a more tenuous existence increasingly vulnerable to shocks and imbalances, a more depleted and inhospitable environment. Think of Hurricane Maria laying bare Puerto Rico's decaying infrastructure or multiplying climate disasters wreaking havoc on communities with minimal resilience. That's the antithesis of sustainable development.

No, to maintain humanity's modern achievements while elevating more of the world to share in its benefits, the only viable pathway runs through the ambitions of SDG 9 - a new era of innovation for sustainable and inclusive infrastructure and industry for all people and nations. It's easier said than achieved, of course. But it's the guiding star that must orient all policies, priorities and partnerships moving forward. Because the truth is, we're all integrated into these cutting-edge supply chains and innovation networks, whether the goal is building out 5G wireless infrastructure, deploying AI for more efficient transportation and smart cities, or editinggenomes to feed the world and cure disease.

The age of  building dumb infrastructure and dirty, inefficient industries while a sliver of innovators races ahead is over. What's needed is radical collaboration between nations and across sectors to develop the smarter, cleaner, more resilient infrastructure, industries and innovations that can pave the road toward sustainable, inclusive development for all. That's the promise, the imperative embedded in SDG 9. Let's achieve it.
