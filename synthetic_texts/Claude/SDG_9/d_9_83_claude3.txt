Here is a long academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) as if written by the Indian author Chetan Bhagat:

What's Up Guys? 

It's me, Chetan, back with another hard-hitting piece about one of the most crucial issues facing India and the world - infrastructure and innovation. You know I always keep it real, so let's dive right into the nitty gritty of SDG 9.

We all know that a strong foundation of resilient infrastructure is key for any country to develop and prosper in the 21st century. Quality roads, rail networks, power grids, internet connectivity - this basic stuff is like the veins and arteries that allow the economic body to pump. Without it, you can forget about attracting investment, generating employment and improving quality of life.

But dudes, we also have to be honest - India has a long way to go when it comes to infrastructure. Our cities are busting at the seams, with insane traffic jams, frequent power cuts and shoddy construction. The rural belt is even worse - just take a road trip through the villages and you'll see the pathetic condition of the roads and lack of even basic amenities. It's no wonder that ease of doing business rankings put us so low down. Investors take one look at our creaky infrastructure and run for the hills faster than Deepika Padukone did from my friend Avi!

Still, we've come a long way since the days of the Licence Raj thanks to policies like Make in India that promote manufacturing. The construction of industrial corridors, smart cities and metros have certainly helped upgrade our capabilities. And we are now a global leader in areas like information technology and remote services. But guys, simply catching up is not enough. To be truly sustainable, India needs to embrace innovation and leapfrog into the industries and technologies of the future.

Think about it - electric vehicles, renewable energy, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, aerospace - these are the sorts of cutting-edge sectors that will power economic growth in the coming decades. With our brilliant tech workforce, favourable demographics and entrepreneurial spirit, India is beautifully positioned to be a world-beater in these areas. We just need the right policies, investment and risk-taking culture to really make it happen.

Some people say we should just follow the conventional path of the West - industrialize first with cheap labour and then make the leap into an innovation economy later. But guys, why can't we do things differently for a change? With the right strategies for technology transfer, domestic R&D and global collaboration, India can aim to be a pioneer in sustainable industrialization from the get-go.  

Look at a success story like the Indian Space Research Organisation and how they managed interplanetary exploration on a budget smaller than Hollywood movie productions'. Dude, if we can send a spacecraft to Mars for that pittance, just imagine what we could achieve if we really invest in science, innovation and entrepreneurship across all fields? The sky is definitely not the limit if India cracks the code on SDG 9.

Of course, it's not going to be easy. There are all sorts of systemic challenges to overcome - insufficient financing, bureaucratic inertia, lack of supporting ecosystems and the constant brain drain as our topmost talent gets lured away by the Googles and Microsofts of the world. But if there's one thing I've learnt, it's that we Indians have an amazing ability to transform adversity into opportunity through our jugaadu spirit of frugal innovation.  

So what are we waiting for guys? The new decade has just begun and the time is ripe for India to totally disrupt the old models of industrial development. With the right strategies, we can built a world-class infrastructure backbone to support our domestic needs while simultaneously leapfrogging into frontier technologies and sustainable industries. By hitting SDG 9 for a six, India can genuinely become the powerhouse economy and innovation nation that we were always destined to be.

Now pass me another kingfisher beer while I contemplate what more wisdom I can drop in my next youth-awakening novel! Cheers guys!
