Here is a detailed academic-style article examining SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) from the perspective of Bj√∏rn Lomborg, the skeptical environmentalist:

The world has made remarkable progress in industrialization, innovation, and infrastructure over the past century. Access to reliable electricity has expanded massively, paving the way for economic growth and improved living standards. Road networks facilitate the movement of people and goods around the globe. Technological breakthroughs in fields like computing, medicine, and renewable energy are dramatically reshaping society. 

And yet, the United Nations has designated a specific Sustainable Development Goal (#9) aimed at "building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization and fostering innovation." This myopic focus on SDG 9 distracts from more critical priorities and comes with massive opportunity costs that could ultimately undermine human wellbeing.

When surveyed, the global population consistently ranks other challenges like health, education, and nutrition as far more pressing than investing in resilient infrastructure or sustainable industrialization. A wide body of evidence demonstrates that economic growth facilitated by investment in productive sectors yields far greater quality of life improvements than the agenda prescribed by SDG 9.

Moreover, stringent sustainability requirements inevitably raise the cost of infrastructure and constrain industrial development, slowing economic growth and poverty reduction. Rigid definitions of "sustainable industrialization" based on minimizing environmental impacts could perpetuate energy poverty by limiting fossil fuel utilization before renewable technologies can meet escalating energy demands. This moral prioritization of unseen environmental effects over tangible reductions in human deprivation is a textbook case of misaligned priorities.

Innovation is undoubtedly vital for human progress and there are compelling reasons for governments to invest in basic research and remove regulatory barriers. But the United Nations' fixation on vaguely-defined concepts like "enhancing scientific research" is a poor proxy for stimulating the market-based innovation that drives technological change and prosperity. Private companies and decentralized trial-and-error processes account for the vast majority of practical innovations that raise living standards.

We should celebrate the incredible infrastructure, industrialization, and innovation witnessed over the past two centuries as crowning achievements of human ingenuity. But doubling down on SDG 9's agenda would be a catastrophic misallocation of global resources that undermines economic freedom, technological progress, and humanity's ascent from poverty.

A more effective approach would prioritize the policy enablers of broad-based economic growth like strengthening property rights, lowering regulatory barriers, investing in human capital, promoting free trade, and letting market forces determine the path of industrialization and infrastructure development. Fixating on SDG 9 reveals a technocratic conceit that wise planners can somehow centrally optimize these complex, evolutionary processes. We should instead maintain regulatory humility and embrace an openness to decentralized economic and technological progress.
