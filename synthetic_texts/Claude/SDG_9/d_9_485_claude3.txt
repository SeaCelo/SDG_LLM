Here is a detailed, comprehensive newspaper article about Sustainable Development Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), written from the perspective of the New York Post:

Bridges to Nowhere! UN's Sustainable Infrastructure Scam

You know what really grinds my gears? When a bunch of jet-setting UN bureaucrats lecture hard-working Americans about building "resilient infrastructure" with our tax dollars. That's exactly what they're doing with their latest boondoggle, the Sustainable Development Goal for "Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure."

Look, I get that we need roads, railways, and basic utilities to keep society functioning. But this UN scheme goes way beyond that, calling for a "sustainable industrialization" overhaul across the entire economy. In plain English? A radical green transformation that will crush jobs, businesses, and our way of life.

The UN claims this "build it back better" nightmare is about making infrastructure more environmentally friendly and "resilient" to disasters. But we all know the real agenda - using climate change as an excuse to regulate, tax, and redistrite wealth from America to their comprador cronies overseas.

Just look at their ridiculous targets. They want to "upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries" by 2030 to make them "sustainable." Have you seen the tens of trillions in cost estimates for their green pipedreams? New Yorkers can barely afford the MTA's repair backlogs as it is!

That's not all though. They also demand increasing access to "affordable and equitable" internet and communications technology worldwide. As if building 5G for indigenous tribes in the Amazon is somehow our responsibility!

And let's not forget their push for more research and "sustainable" technologies like electric vehicles and renewable energy. Because obviously America's world-leading innovation sector needs advice from pampered UN pen-pushers who couldn't invent their way out of a paper bag.

The most galling part? This big government power grab is being sold as a way to "foster innovation" and spur economic growth. That's snake oil economics if I've ever heard it. Study after study shows overregulation and taxes from big sustainability schemes kill productivity and sends jobs overseas.

Don't be fooled by their slick marketing about "sustainable industrialization" either. This is just a neo-Marxist stalking horse to redistribute wealth, mainstream green technocracy, and undermine US industry while enriching their rent-seeking friends in Silicon Valley and overseas sweatshops.

Bottom line: The Sustainability hoax is just a ruse for the UN to become the supreme authority over economic life worldwide. They failed at straightforward socialism, so now they're going for a "sustainable" slow boil of the capitalist frog. 

New Yorkers have seen this movie before with Mayor Bloomberg's nannyism and AOC's Green New Deal lunacy. This time it's coming packaged in UN jargon instead of Brooklyn brokese. But the scam is the same - using sustainability to justify radical policies and centralized control, bankrupting our city and impoverishing its people.

We can't let this Infrastructure for Equity and Climate Justice idiocy take hold in the greatest city on Earth. Tell de Blasio and the UN bed-wetters to keep their grubby hands off our crumbling underground infrastructure! It may need work, but we'll be damned if we let them turn it into a social engineering vanity project.
