As the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), we recognize the pivotal role that SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) plays in fostering sustainable economic growth and development. Our commitment to this goal is unwavering, as we strive to support the transition towards resilient, inclusive, and environmentally responsible industrialization across our regions of operation.

One of our key priorities is to catalyze investments in sustainable infrastructure that not only facilitates economic activities but also addresses the pressing challenges of climate change and environmental degradation. We actively promote the development of green infrastructure, such as renewable energy projects, energy-efficient transportation systems, and sustainable urban planning initiatives. By doing so, we aim to decouple economic growth from resource depletion and greenhouse gas emissions, paving the way for a low-carbon future.

Innovation is another cornerstone of our approach to SDG 9. We recognize that fostering innovation is crucial for enhancing productivity, competitiveness, and resource efficiency across various sectors. Through targeted financing mechanisms and advisory services, we support the development and adoption of cutting-edge technologies, particularly those that promote circular economy principles, resource optimization, and the minimization of waste and emissions.

Our efforts extend beyond traditional financing mechanisms. We actively collaborate with governments, private sector entities, and civil society organizations to create an enabling environment for innovation and entrepreneurship. This includes supporting the development of robust intellectual property rights frameworks, promoting technology transfer, and facilitating access to global knowledge networks and best practices.

Moreover, we place a strong emphasis on strengthening the resilience of industrial and infrastructure systems. Climate change, natural disasters, and geopolitical instability pose significant threats to the continuous operation and sustainability of these critical systems. Our investments and advisory services aim to enhance the adaptive capacity and resilience of these systems, ensuring their ability to withstand shocks and recover swiftly from disruptions.

Addressing regional disparities and promoting inclusive industrialization is another key aspect of our work towards SDG 9. We prioritize investments in underserved and marginalized communities, supporting the development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and fostering their integration into regional and global value chains. By doing so, we aim to create economic opportunities, generate employment, and contribute to the reduction of inequalities within and among countries.

Furthermore, we recognize the importance of leveraging the power of public-private partnerships (PPPs) in achieving SDG 9. Through our expertise in structuring and facilitating PPPs, we foster collaborations between governments, private sector entities, and civil society organizations to mobilize resources, share risks, and harness collective expertise in the pursuit of sustainable industrialization and infrastructure development.

Our commitment to SDG 9 extends beyond traditional financing mechanisms. We actively engage in policy dialogue, knowledge sharing, and capacity-building initiatives to promote best practices, foster regulatory environments conducive to sustainable industrialization, and enhance the skills and expertise of local stakeholders.

As the EBRD, we are acutely aware of the interconnectedness of the Sustainable Development Goals. Our efforts towards SDG 9 are intrinsically linked to progress in other goals, such as SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and SDG 13 (Climate Action). By fostering sustainable industrialization, innovation, and resilient infrastructure, we contribute to the broader agenda of sustainable development, addressing economic, social, and environmental challenges in a holistic manner.
