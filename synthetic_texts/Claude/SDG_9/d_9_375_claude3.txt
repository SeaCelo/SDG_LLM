The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) recognizes the pivotal role of SDG 9 – Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure – in catalyzing sustainable economic growth and development. As a member of the World Bank Group, we are committed to leveraging our expertise and resources to support the achievement of this goal through strategic interventions and innovative financing solutions.

Our analysis indicates that a robust and resilient infrastructure backbone is critical for fostering industrialization, unlocking innovation, and driving economic prosperity. However, many developing nations continue to grapple with significant infrastructure deficits, hindering their ability to participate effectively in global value chains and hindering the growth of industries that could drive job creation and economic diversification.

To address these challenges, MIGA has adopted a multifaceted approach that combines risk mitigation instruments, advisory services, and strategic partnerships. Our political risk insurance products play a crucial role in catalyzing private sector investment in infrastructure projects, particularly in emerging markets where perceived risks may deter investors. By providing comprehensive coverage against risks such as expropriation, currency inconvertibility, and breach of contract, we help create an enabling environment that attracts much-needed private capital for infrastructure development.

Moreover, MIGA recognizes the importance of promoting sustainable and resilient infrastructure that can withstand the impacts of climate change and natural disasters. We prioritize projects that incorporate climate-resilient design principles, utilize clean and renewable energy sources, and adopt sustainable construction practices. By doing so, we aim to support the development of infrastructure that not only facilitates economic growth but also contributes to environmental sustainability and climate action.

In the realm of innovation, MIGA actively supports projects that foster technological advancements and knowledge transfer. We collaborate with private sector partners, research institutions, and innovation hubs to facilitate the dissemination of cutting-edge technologies and best practices. This includes supporting the development of sustainable and resource-efficient industrial processes, promoting the adoption of digital technologies, and fostering entrepreneurship and innovation ecosystems.

Furthermore, we recognize the importance of public-private partnerships (PPPs) in mobilizing the necessary resources and expertise for infrastructure development and industrial growth. MIGA plays a pivotal role in de-risking PPP projects, enabling governments and private entities to leverage their respective strengths and capabilities. Our credit enhancement products and risk mitigation instruments help mitigate perceived risks, facilitating the structuring of financially viable and sustainable PPP arrangements.

Through our tailored advisory services, we assist governments in creating enabling policy and regulatory frameworks that foster private sector participation in infrastructure and industrial development. Our experts provide guidance on issues such as project structuring, risk allocation, and contract management, ensuring that projects are designed to optimize value for money and long-term sustainability.

Additionally, MIGA actively collaborates with various stakeholders, including other multilateral development banks, bilateral agencies, and private sector organizations, to align efforts and leverage complementary strengths. By fostering strategic partnerships and knowledge-sharing platforms, we aim to amplify the impact of our interventions and promote sustainable and inclusive growth.

In conclusion, MIGA's multidimensional approach to supporting SDG 9 reflects our commitment to catalyzing sustainable industrialization, fostering innovation, and developing resilient infrastructure. Through our risk mitigation instruments, advisory services, and strategic partnerships, we aim to create an enabling environment that attracts private sector investment, promotes technology transfer, and facilitates the development of sustainable and inclusive industries that drive economic growth and development.
