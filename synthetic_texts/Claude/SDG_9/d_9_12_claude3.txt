The Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) has been at the forefront of promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization, fostering innovation, and facilitating resilient infrastructure development in the Asia-Pacific region. Despite substantial progress in recent decades, significant challenges persist in achieving Sustainable Development Goal 9 (SDG 9) â€“ "Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation."

The region's industrialization journey has been marked by both triumphs and setbacks. While countries like China, South Korea, and Singapore have emerged as global manufacturing powerhouses, others continue to grapple with low productivity, technological gaps, and limited access to finance for industrial development. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated these disparities, highlighting the urgent need for resilient and sustainable industrial policies.

ESCAP recognizes the pivotal role of infrastructure in enabling inclusive and sustainable industrialization. The region faces a staggering infrastructure financing gap, estimated at $1.7 trillion annually until 2030. Addressing this gap requires innovative financing mechanisms, such as public-private partnerships, blended finance, and leveraging domestic resource mobilization. However, it is crucial to ensure that infrastructure investments are not only fiscally sustainable but also environmentally and socially responsible.

The region's rapid urbanization presents both opportunities and challenges for sustainable infrastructure development. Urban centers act as engines of economic growth, but they also contribute to environmental degradation, congestion, and inequalities. ESCAP advocates for integrated urban planning, prioritizing sustainable transport systems, energy-efficient buildings, and resilient water and sanitation infrastructure. Promoting smart cities and leveraging digital technologies can further enhance resource efficiency and improve service delivery.

Fostering innovation is a critical enabler for achieving SDG 9, as it drives productivity, competitiveness, and sustainable solutions. ESCAP supports member States in developing national innovation ecosystems, promoting research and development (R&D), and facilitating technology transfer. However, addressing the digital divide and bridging the innovation gap between countries remains a formidable challenge.

The transition towards a circular economy represents a transformative opportunity for sustainable industrialization in the region. ESCAP encourages the adoption of resource-efficient and cleaner production practices, promoting eco-industrial parks, and fostering industrial symbiosis. By decoupling economic growth from resource consumption and environmental degradation, the region can unlock new opportunities for green industries and sustainable job creation.

Achieving SDG 9 is intrinsically linked to progress in other SDGs, such as SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), and SDG 13 (climate action). ESCAP promotes an integrated approach, recognizing the synergies and trade-offs between these interrelated goals.

In conclusion, the path towards inclusive and sustainable industrialization, resilient infrastructure, and fostering innovation in the Asia-Pacific region is complex and multifaceted. ESCAP remains committed to supporting member States in addressing these challenges through policy advice, capacity-building, and regional cooperation. By leveraging innovative solutions, harnessing partnerships, and adopting a holistic and integrated approach, the region can accelerate its progress towards achieving SDG 9 and unlocking its sustainable development potential.
