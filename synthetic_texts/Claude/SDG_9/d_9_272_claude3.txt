Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), written from the perspective of economist Drew Fudenberg:

Achieving long-term sustainable economic growth requires strategic investments in resilient infrastructure, sustainable industrialization, and the fostering of innovation. The 9th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 9) sets ambitious targets in this domain that are fundamental to catalyzing progress across the entire 2030 Agenda. 

A core premise of SDG 9 is that growth must go hand-in-hand with equitable industrialization and technological progress to benefit all segments of society. The developing world faces massive infrastructure deficits, with billions lacking access to reliable electricity, roads, ICT and other essential services. This represents both a challenge and immense opportunity for sustainable investment.

From a game theory perspective, infrastructure networks exhibit strong complementarities and network effects. The economic geography literature highlights how small initial cost advantages can lead to agglomeration effects which are highly path dependent. Consequently, coordination problems and multiple equilibria abound. Strategic infrastructure investments today can help economies escape liquidity traps and leap onto a higher, more efficient growth path.

However, directing resources into public goods like infrastructure faces collective action issues and free-rider problems. Mechanisms are needed to enable credible commitment and create incentive-compatible policies. One possibility is an infrastructure financing facility using an IPD-like global funding scheme with transfer payments to align incentives. Partner countries could be clustered into different risk/return tiers based on institutional quality metrics.

On innovation, there is empirical evidence that competitive product markets spur process innovation investments, while ex-ante high industry concentration dampens incentives for path-breaking innovations. Yet firms face moral hazard in fully internalizing R&D spillovers, leading to socially suboptimal levels of innovation unless strong IP protections exist.

A potential solution is a portfolio of innovation policies combining patent protections with R&D tax credits, procurement incentives, and Advance Market Commitments to collectively move the economy closer to the socially optimal level of innovation. Targeted "Grand Challenges" can focus efforts on major roadblocks.

Carbon pricing and removing energy subsidies would also stimulate low-carbon innovation and infrastructure investments vital for climate change mitigation. However, directing technical change is complex given uncertainties, information lags, and changing factor prices which dynamically reshape isocost curves over time.

In sum, achieving SDG 9 requires aligning recursive incentives through a multifaceted set of coordinating institutions and innovation policies cognizant of intertemporal opportunity costs. Mechanisms enabling credible pre-commitment to a stable institutional ecosystem catalyzing sustainable growth are paramount. Given increasing returns in R&D and infrastructure, it's a narrow economic possibility frontier, but one with profound economy-wide repercussions if successfully navigated.
