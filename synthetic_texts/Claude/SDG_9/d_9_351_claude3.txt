Thailand's National Committee for Sustainable Development has been proactively engaged in driving the nation's progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 9 (SDG 9) â€“ Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure. As an integral part of this endeavor, the Thailand International Cooperation Agency (TICA) has played a vital role in fostering international partnerships and mobilizing resources to support the country's efforts.

TICA's strategic approach to addressing SDG 9 has been multifaceted, encompassing various initiatives and collaborations. One of the agency's key priorities has been to facilitate knowledge exchange and capacity-building programs with other nations, particularly those in the ASEAN region. Through these initiatives, TICA has facilitated the transfer of best practices, innovative technologies, and sustainable infrastructure solutions, enabling Thailand to leverage global expertise and accelerate its progress.

A notable example of TICA's efforts is the "Sustainable Industrial Development Program," a joint initiative with the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO). This program has focused on promoting resource-efficient and environmentally sound industrial practices, aligning with the targets of SDG 9. By providing technical assistance, training, and policy support, the program has empowered Thai industries to adopt cleaner production methods, reduce waste, and enhance energy efficiency, contributing to the country's environmental sustainability goals.

Furthermore, TICA has actively engaged in South-South and triangular cooperation initiatives, facilitating knowledge sharing and technology transfer between Thailand and other developing nations. One such initiative is the "Green Industrial Park Development" project, implemented in collaboration with the Vietnam Industrial Parks Development Corporation. This project aims to promote sustainable industrial park management practices, incorporating principles of resource efficiency, waste minimization, and renewable energy utilization. By sharing Thailand's expertise and best practices, TICA has contributed to the development of environmentally responsible industrial infrastructure in Vietnam, fostering regional cooperation and supporting the achievement of SDG 9 on a broader scale.

In addition to international partnerships, TICA has played a crucial role in mobilizing financial resources and leveraging public-private partnerships to support the development of resilient infrastructure in Thailand. The agency has collaborated with multilateral development banks, such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank, to secure funding for key infrastructure projects. These projects have prioritized sustainable and climate-resilient design principles, ensuring that Thailand's infrastructure development aligns with the targets of SDG 9 while also addressing the challenges posed by climate change.

One notable example is the "Smart City Development Program," a collaboration between TICA, the ADB, and the private sector. This program aims to transform urban areas in Thailand into sustainable, digitally connected, and efficiently managed cities. By integrating cutting-edge technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), smart grids, and intelligent transportation systems, the program is enhancing the resilience and resource efficiency of urban infrastructure, while also promoting innovation and economic growth.

TICA's efforts extend beyond infrastructure development, as the agency has also been actively involved in promoting research and innovation ecosystems within Thailand. Through partnerships with local universities, research institutions, and the private sector, TICA has facilitated the establishment of innovation hubs and technology parks. These collaborative spaces serve as incubators for startups, fostering entrepreneurship, and supporting the development of innovative solutions that contribute to sustainable industrial practices and infrastructure.

Moreover, TICA has recognized the importance of enhancing access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) as a crucial enabler for sustainable development. The agency has supported initiatives to expand broadband connectivity, particularly in rural and remote areas, bridging the digital divide and ensuring equitable access to information and services. This aligns with the targets of SDG 9, which emphasize the need for affordable and accessible ICT infrastructure.

TICA's comprehensive approach to addressing SDG 9 has been driven by a strong commitment to stakeholder engagement and inclusive partnerships. The agency has actively collaborated with civil society organizations, local communities, and marginalized groups, ensuring that their perspectives and needs are integrated into the development of sustainable infrastructure and industrial policies. This inclusive approach has not only fostered greater ownership and acceptance of these initiatives but has also contributed to the overall societal resilience and sustainability of Thailand's development efforts.

As Thailand continues its journey towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, TICA's role as a catalyst for international cooperation, resource mobilization, and knowledge sharing remains pivotal. Through its strategic initiatives and partnerships, the agency has demonstrated a deep understanding of the interconnectedness between sustainable infrastructure, industrialization, and innovation, recognizing their collective impact on economic growth, environmental sustainability, and social well-being.

TICA's efforts have not only contributed to Thailand's progress but have also positioned the country as a regional leader in sustainable development, inspiring and guiding other nations in their pursuit of the SDGs. By fostering international collaboration, promoting knowledge exchange, and leveraging innovative solutions, TICA has exemplified the transformative power of global partnerships in accelerating sustainable development and creating a more prosperous and resilient future for all.
