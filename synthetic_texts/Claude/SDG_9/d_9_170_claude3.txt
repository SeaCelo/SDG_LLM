Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), written from the perspective of economist Paul Krugman:

The ninth Sustainable Development Goal set forth by the United Nations is a crucial one for driving economic progress - both within nations and on a global scale. At its core, SDG 9 calls for building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and fostering innovation. These are lofty ambitions, but they get to the heart of what truly catalyzes economic growth and development in our modern world.

Let's start with the infrastructure component. It is impossible to have a productive, efficient economy without adequate transportation networks, utilities, and telecommunications systems as the backbone. An economy is in many ways like a circulatory system - it requires ways to move people, goods, services, energy, information and resources around effectively. Poorly developed or decaying infrastructure strangles that flow and imposes massive drags on productivity and living standards.

The impacts of deficient infrastructure manifest in many ways - time wasted sitting in traffic, power outages disrupting businesses, lack of access to education and markets in rural areas, and more. A study by the American Society of Civil Engineers estimated that the U.S. suffers $3.9 trillion in losses from our crumbling infrastructure. Developing economies fare even worse with infrastructure deficits. The World Bank says a 10% increase in infrastructure investment directly increases GDP by over 1% in the same year.  

Investing in infrastructure is investing in growth multipliers that pay enormous dividends over time. When the U.S. built the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s and 60s, it transformed domestic commerce and logistics. The Internet went global through telecommunications infrastructure that allowed the free flow of data. Developing economies now have the opportunity to leapfrog legacy systems and rapidly modernize through mobile broadband and renewable energy grids from the start.

The next critical piece is the sustainable industrialization imperative. While the environmental impacts of heavy industry have been devastating in many parts of the world, we cannot simply wish it away. Manufacturing remains the engine that drives economic might for both developed and developing nations. But we must find ways to reconcile industrialization with sustainability and a circular economy approach.

China has become a manufacturing juggernaut, but did so in ways that tragically poisoned its air, water and land. That's the old model we need to jettison. The new model harnesses technological advances in materials science, waste recycling, renewable energy and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) monitoring to drastically reduce environmental footprints. Facilities adhering to LEED green building standards, from the automotive factories to microchip fabs, showcase what the future of sustainable manufacturing can look like.

This segues to the final core element of SDG 9 â€“ spurring innovation through investment in research and development. Innovation has always been the real spark that ignites economic revolutions, by disrupting old industries and creating entirely new ones. The internet and its constellation of consumer tech, cloud platforms, mobile devices and applications is the latest world-altering wave. So is the biotechnology revolution happening in medicine, agriculture, materials and energy.

Countries that increase expenditure on R&D activities as a percentage of GDP consistently see productivity surge over time. The tech titans like the U.S., Japan, South Korea and Germany have harnessed public and private R&D might to retain their economic supremacy. But many developing economies are now also focusing on R&D and STEM education to catalyze innovation-driven growth industries of their own.

Consider the case of Taiwan, which has rapidly transformed itself into a global powerhouse of semiconductor manufacturing over the past few decades. This was fueled by strategic R&D programs and initiatives to build world-class facilities and a highly-skilled technology workforce pipeline. The mobile phones, laptops, connected devices and cloud data centers that power our digital age simply would not exist without Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC).

In summary, SDG 9 is about building the modern economic scaffold to uplift human society as a whole. It is an interdependent web of resilient infrastructure, sustainable industry, and catalytic innovation. While the challenges are immense, the potential upsides in increased productivity, reduced resource depletion, and accelerated technological progress that can pull billions out of poverty make it an endeavor well worth pursuing. Economic growth alone is not the goal, but an enhanced quality of life enabled by the SDG 9 pillars of industrialization, infrastructure and ingenuity.
