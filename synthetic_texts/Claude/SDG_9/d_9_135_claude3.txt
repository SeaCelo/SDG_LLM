Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), written from the perspective of Mark Steel:

The Delusion of Infinite Economic Growth on a Finite Planet

By Mark Steel, Renowned Satirist and Social Commentator

Let's start by ripping off the Band-Aid - the entire premise of the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 9 is completely at odds with reality. We're meant to believe that pursuing "sustainable industrialization" along with "resilient infrastructure, inclusive and sustainable innovation" will somehow magically fix all the world's problems. It's utter codswallop if you think about it for more than 30 seconds.  

The overarching economic system underpinning modern civilization is predicated on the delusional myth of infinite growth and expansion on a planet with finite resources and a fragile ecosystem. It's the global equivalent of a ponzi scheme that has to keep accelerating and devouring more resources to stave off its inevitable collapse. The pursuit of infinite economic growth is anathema to true sustainability. 

The uncomfortable truth is that infinite growth on a finite planet is mathematically and scientifically impossible. Yet we've somehow managed to construct an entire global economy, replete with trillions in debts, assets and derivatives, that is wholly contingent on this logical fallacy continuing in perpetuity. It's akin to believing the earth is flat despite insurmountable evidence to the contrary. 

So in strutting forth with bold plans for yet more industrialization, infrastructure and innovation to foster yet more growth, we've entirely missed the forest for the trees. We're doing the precise OPPOSITE of what's needed to cultivate genuine sustainability and existential resilience as a species. Instead of reconfiguring human civilization to operate within the planet's stable environmental limits, we're charting a hellbound trajectory of overshooting those limits while mistakenly thinking we can somehow innovate our way out of this civilizational checkmate.

The cognitive dissonance and hubristic folly embodied in SDG 9 would be comedic if the stakes and potential consequences weren't so dire. What good are more factories, mines, roads, and factories if we've irreversibly destabilized the planet's climate and ecosystems on which all economic activity depends? The madness has to stop.

Genuine sustainability requires degrowth, relocalization, and a transition to a steady-state economic model with a focus on maintaining rather than expanding our overall ecological footprint. We need infrastructure that's resilient against the coming climate shocks, not more suicidal lock-in to carbon-intensive industrial overcapacity. Innovation should be harnessed for developing technologies and systems to facilitate humanity's progression into equilibrium with nature, not to perpetuate our cancerous devouring of the planet's diminishing resources.

All the metrics reified and valorized by SDG 9 - manufacturing value added, industrial CO2 emissions, R&D expenditure, researchers per capita, mobile broadband subscriptions, etc. - merely quantify the magnitude of humanity's metabolic snuffing out of our only home's vital signs. It's the precise OPPOSITE path we should be taking as a species.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not some anti-technology Luddite pining for a return to the Stone Age. Rather, I'm calling for an urgent reappraisal of Modernity's cherished axioms and a profound course correction before we steer our precious pale blue dot over an ecological cliff. A scorched, uninhabitable planet with gleaming infrastructure and whiz-bang technological innovations is a nightmare scenario akin to framing a natural wonderland photo with the emaciated skull of the last tiger.

If humanity is to have any hope of achieving the broader ambitions embedded in the Sustainable Development Goals, we need a fundamental paradigm shift in how we conceive of "development" in the first place. Goal 9 epitomizes the outmoded, misguided and lethal neoliberal ideology that got us into this existential mess to begin with. To embrace it wholeheartedly, without reconfiguration towards ecological stability and equilibrium, would be the height of folly.

There, I've ranted and raved enough for one article. You lot can carry on dithering with your piddling little goals while the planet burns. But at least I've gotten this Dead Milkmen song out of my head: "If the Romans went a bit too far, then Renaissance ushered in Baroque and the Portuguese somewheres out in the Atlantic were hugging the coasts of America looking for Indies where the curry came from..." Now it's your turn.
