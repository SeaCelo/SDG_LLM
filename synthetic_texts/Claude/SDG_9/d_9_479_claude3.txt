Here is a long newspaper article about Sustainable Development Goal 9, written as if for The Washington Post:

Building the Foundation for Shared Prosperity: The Urgent Need for Resilient Infrastructure, Inclusive Industrialization, and Sustainable Innovation 

By Alex Berenson, Staff Writer

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- As the world races to implement the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, the ambitious targets enshrined in SDG 9 have emerged as a centerpiece for fostering long-term economic growth, creating employment opportunities, and spurring technological progress across both developed and developing nations.

SDG 9 calls for building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and fostering innovation. Experts deem these pillars indispensable for eradicating poverty, safeguarding the environment, and establishing shared prosperity globally.

"Inadequate infrastructure hinders social mobility, impedes trade and commerce, exacerbates inequality, and undercuts sovereign technological capabilities," said Sarah Hill, lead infrastructure specialist at the World Bank. "SDG 9 provides a vital framework for transforming the connective arteries that drive human potential in the 21st century."

The statistics are staggering: 940 million people lack access to electricity, while a staggering 3.6 billion individuals remain unconnected to the internet. One in four people globally are navigating unmapped pathways deprived of all-weather roads. In developing economies, relatively minuscule investments in research and development—often less than 1% of GDP—have created gaping technological divides.

These chasms breed instability, conflict, and economic privation while hampering climate adaptation and disaster resilience. The COVID-19 pandemic laid bare these harsh realities as millions were disconnected from digital learning, remote work opportunities, and essential services.

Successfully implementing SDG 9 will require an arsenal of multi-pronged interventions. At the forefront is large-scale financing for infrastructure upgrades, with estimates ranging from $6.9 trillion annually until 2030 for developing nations alone. Such investments must prioritize low-carbon, climate-resilient solutions aligned with the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global temperature rise.

"Building resilient transportation networks, renewable energy grids, and sanitation systems is paramount," remarked Jeffrey Sachs, Director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University. "But we must also shore up digital infrastructure through 5G deployment, fiber-optic expansions, and bolstering cybersecurity—the connective tissue of the modern economy."   

Complementing this infrastructure overhaul is the need to promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization across regions and income strata. This pivotal undertaking entails diffusing environmentally-sound technologies and processes, while ensuring nations retain agency over their development pathways. 

"We have to transition away from the antiquated pollution-havens model toward a future where industry generates decent jobs, introduces resource-efficient practices, and catalyzes sustainable value chains within a circular economic framework," stated Jayathi Ghosh, Executive Secretary of the United Nations' Support Measure for Benefit-Sharing.

Embedded within this transformation is the imperative of fostering local innovation ecosystems—the third prong of SDG 9. From bolstering scientific research and upgrading tertiary education to incentivizing entrepreneurship and protecting intellectual property rights, such initiatives are vital for cultivating the solutions that will surmount humanity's grandest challenges.

"Sustainable development hinges on our ingenuity to innovate," explained Dava Newman, Director of the MIT Portugal Program. "Whether designing compact nuclear reactors, revolutionizing water filtration, or streamlining supply chain logistics, innovation is the catalyst for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals."

Yet, beyond shoring up human capital pipelines, innovation hubs must rapidly emerge across the Global South—not through top-down technology transfers, but via indigenous entrepreneurial ecosystems propelling self-sustaining growth trajectories from within. Supporting bottom-up solutions is pivotal for stakeholder buy-in and scalability.

Underpinning these multidimensional initiatives is an overarching need for global cooperation and solidarity. SDG 9 cries out for unprecedented cross-border coordination among governments, multilateral development banks, private capital providers, academic institutions, and civil society organizations.

"No nation can afford to go it alone, and no single actor commands the resources and expertise to reshape infrastructure, drive industrial overhauls, and unlock innovation simultaneously," said Douglas Rediker, a former U.S. representative to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. "Shared financing, joint scientific endeavors, and collective regulatory reform are vital for realizing SDG 9's transformative potential."

The urgency is palpable, the path forward audacious—but the ramifications of complacency are unacceptable. Infrastructure deficits cost developing countries upwards of $1 trillion annually due to economic inefficiency and stymied competitiveness. Industrial pollution continues to ravage human health and biodiversity. Shortsighted linear economies exacerbate climate instability and resource depletion.    

Pursuing the game-changing ambitions of SDG 9 holds the key for transcending these fragilities and forging enduring economic, social, and environmental fortitude globally. It provides the launchpad for scaling-up investment, modernizing production practices, and unleashing mankind's unbridled potential for creativity and discovery.

"SDG 9 is the linchpin for sustainable prosperity that leaves no nation, no community, and no individual behind," declared Henrietta Fore, Executive Director of UNICEF. "Its realization will birth new cities, reimagine industry's role, and transform societies through innovation. Failure is unconscionable."
