Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), written from the perspective of Ben Shapiro:

The Path to Sustainable Industrialization: A Rational Conservative View

By Ben Shapiro

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 9 seeks to "build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation." On its face, this appears to be a reasonable objective with several key principles conservatism ought to uphold – economic productivity, technological advancement, and strengthening national security through resilient systems. However, the progressive ideology underpinning Agenda 2030 and its explicit pursuit of international wealth redistribution render SDG 9 a statist Trojan horse that risks hamstringing the very innovation it claims to promote.

Central to understanding SDG 9 is the fundamental tension between static analysis and dynamic scoring of economic policy. Static analysis, favored by the bureaucratic left, mechanically maps inputs and outputs without considering the systemic impact of government intervention. Dynamic analysis, preferred by conservative economists, accounts for complex feedback loops and anticipates how market actors will adjust their behavior in response to incentives and constraints.

The Keynesian progressive impulse treats industrialization as a top-down process that can be achieved through centralized planning and brute force investment. They naively assume that shovel-ready infrastructure projects create tangible productivity gains without fully pricing in the deadweight loss of taxation, regulatory friction, and crowding out of private investment. This zero-sum mentality fails to appreciate the bottom-up emergent order that arises when entrepreneurs are empowered to leverage new technologies.

Historically, the transformative breakthroughs catalyzing industrialization – the spinning jenny, steam engine, assembly line – arose organically from market competition rather than bureaucratic fiat. The role of government ought to be creating a nurturing environment for private innovation by upholding the rule of law, protecting property rights, and maintaining a light regulatory touch. All too often, centralized industrial policy pursued in the name of lofty Sustainable Development targets becomes a cronyist regime of subsidies, protectionism and regulatory capture that props up inefficient incumbents at the expense of disruptive competition.

This is not to dismiss the importance of infrastructure in facilitating commerce and raising living standards. Roads, power grids, telecommunications and cybersecurity are indeed critical public goods that markets often underprovide on their own. here is a prime role for constitutionally-limited government to fill funding gaps through public-private partnerships and implement user-based pricing mechanisms that incentivize efficient resource allocation.

However, it is folly to outsource infrastructure planning to unelected supranational institutions beholden to radical environmentalist ideologues and adversarial global powers. Not only do such unaccountable bureaucracies lack the localized knowledge to prioritize geographically-specific needs, but their implicit biases often prioritize symbolically "sustainable" vanity projects over pragmatic economic development.Witness the prevalence of underutilized high-speed rail boondoggles, impractically-located "eco-cities," and renewables infrastructure that sacrifices baseload reliability for virtue-signaling optics.

From a national security lens, SDG 9 compounds the risks of America's growing reliance on globalized supply chains and strategic dependence on rivals like China for critical materials and technologies. Any infrastructure program that deepens economic integration with revisionist powers like Russia or China – for example, through their debt-trap Belt and Road Initiative – incrementally undermines US leverage while subsidizing geopolitical foes. Energy infrastructure expansion into Middle East petropolies directly funds theocratic regimes unaligned with Western values.

Prudent conservatives must remain vigilant against these persistent threats to American economic and strategic sovereignty. Sustainable industrialization, innovation and infrastructure require embracing a realist paradigm that robustly funds domestic capital investment, rebuilds critical stockpiles, reshores production of key inputs and technologies, and implements reciprocal free trade premised on fairness rather than naïve market-opening.

Moreover, the "sustainability" framing of SDG 9, despite its benign connotations, has become a rhetorical Trojan horse for anti-growth policies rooted in neo-Malthusian environmentalism. Across multilateral fora, sustainability is wielded as a bludgeon against vital American industries under the ruse of mitigating climate change and a broader anti-capitalist ideology hostile to material abundance. Resource extraction, manufacturing output, transportation networks and other catalysts of economic growth are systematically demonized and constrained in pursuit of an ascetic pastoral fantasy.

In the final analysis, SDG 9 cannot be surgically severed from the broader Agenda 2030 package that enshrines a globalizing  progressive supremacy. While notional goals of accessible resilient infrastructure and  innovation-driven productivity are laudable in isolation, their inclusion offers political cover for a dystopian vision of top-down control that curtails national sovereignty, empowers unaccountable bureaucrats, subsidizes geopolitical threats, and subordinates human flourishing to radical ecological puritanism.

Rather than concede to this transnational progressive creep, true American conservatives must counter with an aspirational agenda centered on economic freedom, national industrial renewal, and technological dominance. Private property, economic liberty, limited government and free market capitalism are the only proven drivers of material abundance, innovation and rising living standards.
