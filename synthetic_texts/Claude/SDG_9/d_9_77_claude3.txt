The Hubris of Sustainable Development Goal 9

By Margaret Wente

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals represent a breathtaking act of conceit on the part of Western elites. Among the most delusional is SDG 9, which presumes to dictate the path of industrialization and technological progress for the entire developing world. Its arrogance is only exceeded by its naiveté.

The drafters of SDG 9 purport to foster sustainable industrialization, resilient infrastructure, and innovation across the Global South. But their conception of what constitutes "sustainability" is rooted entirely in contemporary Western orthodoxies that are antithetical to the realities of economic development. 

The goal calls for retrofitting existing industries to make them environmentally "sustainable" based on arbitrary emissions targets. But for billions still emerging from poverty, prioritizing environmental sanctimony over economic dynamism is not just unwise - it is immoral. The developed world got rich by harnessing fossil fuels, but now seeks to deprive the undeveloped of those same energies through a mix of regulatory hurdles and condescending moralizing.

Poverty remains humanity's principal existential threat, having claimed far more lives than any environmental ill. Responsible industrialization and infrastructural development remain the most potent drivers for eliminating destitution. But SDG 9 would encumber that process with ecological fantasies more befitting of Gaia worshippers than pragmatic policymakers.

The targets relating to sustainable infrastructure are particularly farcical. They demand huge public investments to develop "quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient" systems - a perpetual money pit for import-dependent developing economies. This ignores the public costs of ill-conceived prestige projects like high-speed rail lines that insolvent nations can ill afford. Ideally, infrastructure decisions should be left to national authorities and disciplined by market forces, not distorted by globalist social engineering.

Equally laughable are the goals around enhancing "scientific research" and "encouraging innovation" in developing countries. As if resource-starved economies can be catalyzed into dynamic innovation hubs through sheer power of UN proclamations. Innovation is an iterative, ground-up phenomenon that occurs organically over time through market competition – not by diktat from bureaucratic central planners.  

The UN's obsession with promoting domestic R&D obscures how reverse-engineering and incremental adaptation of existing technologies from abroad have historically facilitated catch-up growth. Most substantive innovations accrue to the advantage of consumers worldwide anyway, regardless of origin. Fetishizing localized innovation metrics is merely a sop to nationalist egos and rent-seeking researchers.

This shoddy framework culminates in a target for massively expanding access to information and communications technology. With nary a thought to the costs and trade-offs involved. Ubiquitous internet and mobile access may empower some, but also threatens to destabilize traditional societies and foment unrest among populations abruptly exposed to radical ideologies and imported culture wars. Prudent societies necessarily regulate the flows of transformative technologies.

In its totality, SDG 9 reflects the West's unearned self-satisfaction at having subjugated the material world, coupled with grandiose aspirations to micromanage the economic and technological trajectories of developing nations. All couched in the obfuscating jargon of equity, resilience, and sustainability that veils a profound impulse toward social control.

If implemented with the zeal its architects no doubt intend, SDG 9 imperils the economic flourishing of the undeveloped world it presumes to assist. Its rigid prescriptions for how industrialization and innovation "should" transpire risk shackling the very economic dynamism required for authentic progress. At best it is an intellectual folly; at worst, a vehicle for pernicious ideological colonialism rationalized as cooperation for the greater good.
