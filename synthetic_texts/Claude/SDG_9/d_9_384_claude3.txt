The Sustainable Development Goals, a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all, have become the blueprint for a better and more sustainable future. Among these ambitious targets, Goal 9 – Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure – stands out as a catalyst for driving inclusive and sustainable industrialization, fostering innovation, and building resilient infrastructure.

As the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, I recognize the pivotal role that Goal 9 plays in creating an enabling environment for displaced populations to rebuild their lives and contribute to the socio-economic development of their host communities. The challenges faced by refugees and internally displaced persons are multifaceted, and addressing them requires a holistic approach that encompasses access to affordable and sustainable infrastructure, inclusive industrialization, and the promotion of innovation.

Resilient infrastructure is the backbone of sustainable development, and its importance cannot be overstated in the context of refugee settings. Access to reliable and affordable transportation, energy, water, and communication networks is crucial for ensuring the well-being and dignity of displaced populations. Furthermore, resilient infrastructure serves as a catalyst for economic growth, enabling refugees to access employment opportunities, education, and healthcare services.

One of the key priorities in addressing the infrastructure needs of refugee communities is the promotion of sustainable and resilient solutions. This includes the incorporation of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, which not only reduce the environmental footprint but also provide cost-effective and reliable energy solutions. Additionally, the adoption of green building practices and the use of eco-friendly materials in the construction of refugee settlements can contribute to the mitigation of environmental degradation and the promotion of sustainable living conditions.

Furthermore, the promotion of inclusive and sustainable industrialization is essential for empowering refugees and fostering their economic integration into host communities. By creating opportunities for skills development, vocational training, and entrepreneurship, we can unlock the entrepreneurial potential of displaced populations and facilitate their participation in the local economy. This not only contributes to their self-reliance and resilience but also supports the overall economic development of the host countries.

Innovation plays a pivotal role in addressing the challenges faced by refugees and finding sustainable solutions. By fostering an environment that encourages innovation and the development of new technologies, we can unlock novel approaches to addressing issues such as access to education, healthcare, and employment opportunities. For instance, the use of mobile learning platforms and digital solutions can help bridge the education gap faced by refugee children, while the application of innovative agricultural techniques can enhance food security and promote self-sufficiency.

Partnerships and collaboration are essential for achieving the targets set by Goal 9. By leveraging the expertise and resources of various stakeholders, including governments, private sector entities, civil society organizations, and academic institutions, we can accelerate the development and implementation of innovative solutions. These collaborative efforts can facilitate knowledge sharing, foster technology transfer, and promote investment in sustainable infrastructure projects that benefit both refugee populations and host communities.

In conclusion, the Sustainable Development Goal 9 – Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure – represents a powerful catalyst for driving inclusive and sustainable development for refugee populations. By prioritizing resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive industrialization, and fostering an environment that encourages innovation, we can create an enabling environment for displaced communities to rebuild their lives, contribute to the local economy, and thrive as active members of their host societies.
