Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) from the perspective of economist Dani Rodrik:

The Sustainable Development Goals have provided a useful framework for mobilizing global efforts around key development challenges. However, SDG 9 on industry, innovation and infrastructure raises some difficult questions that must be grappled with. As an economist focused on the dynamics of economic growth and productive transformation in developing societies, I have some reservations about the way this goal has been framed.

First, we must recognize that the process of economic development inherently involves a structural shift out of traditional agriculture and low-productivity services into modern manufacturing and other tradable activities. This structural change is an essential driver of productivity growth and income gains. So in some sense, the targets under SDG 9 around promoting industrialization, upgrading infrastructure, and boosting technological capabilities get at something fundamentally important. Where I depart is the underlying assumption that there is a common template or convergence towards some "modern" form of economic organization.

My work on production revolutionaries and learning societies emphasizes that the binding constraints on economic progress differ greatly across contexts. In some settings, poor infrastructure may be the key bottleneck. In others, it may be inadequate skills, weak managerial capabilities, coordination failures, or lack of access to markets. Technological innovation may take very different forms – breakthrough inventions, incremental process improvements, new methods of organizing production, adapting existing techniques to local circumstances, and so on. A one-size-fits-all approach that equates "industrialization" with building more factories is likely to miss the mark.

Moreover, the optimal prioritization of different types of infrastructure, skill-building, and technological effort will necessarily be context-specific. High fixed costs and construction capabilities needed for massive infrastructure projects may be a poor use of resources in many low-income environments with limited fiscal space. What worked for Korea may be a poor model for present-day Cambodia or Burkina Faso. Skill-acquisition efforts may be better focused on remedying glaring gaps rather than adopting advanced STEM curricula from rich nations. Institutional reforms and regulatory improvements to enable new business formation may take precedence over building industrial parks.

The experience of successful catch-up economies like Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and China teaches that strategic prioritization, experimentation, and an outward orientation enabled these countries to build productive capabilities over time. In contrast, the import-substitution industrialization model that reigned across much of the developing world until the 1980s failed dismally. So rather than pursuing blunt industrial policies aimed at certain sectors, we need to think carefully about expanding the opportunities for new firms, activities, and indeed entire industries to emerge and develop organically in each setting.  

A second concern I have with SDG 9 relates to the emphasis on domestic efforts – building resilient "infrastructure", promoting "inclusive and sustainable industrialization", and so on. While these worthy objectives should not be ignored, the big driver of economic convergence comes from integrating with more advanced producers and tapping into larger markets for goods, services, capital, and ideas. The success stories in Asia and elsewhere have leveraged global value chains, technology transfer, foreign direct investment, and participation in trade to rapidly acquire and master modern production capabilities.  

So I would place greater emphasis on ensuring an environment that enables developing nations to join regional and global production networks. This entails reducing trade barriers, implementing the complementary domestic policies that make a country an attractive platform for offshoring, and negotiating deeper integration agreements that harmonize standards and regulations on investment, intellectual property rights, labor mobility and more. National-level measures have their place, but global integration and technological diffusion deserve pride of place.

In sum, SDG 9 captures some of the right aspirations for economic transformation, but relies too heavily on outdated statist conceptions of industrial policy that seek to replicate production structures from more advanced economies. Far better would be to focus on creating facilitating environments in which new products and technologies can emerge in an evolutionary, bottom-up fashion. With greater reliance on openness, experimentation, and market incentives, the drive for "industry, innovation and infrastructure" stands a better chance of enhancing the dynamism and adaptability needed for sustainable, shared prosperity.
