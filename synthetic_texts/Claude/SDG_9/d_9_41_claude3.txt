Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), written from the perspective of Piers Akerman:

The Great Green Delusion and the Perils of Industrial "Sustainability"

By Piers Akerman, Distinguished Fellow at the Heartland Institute

The misguided utopians at the United Nations have foisted upon the world yet another centrally-planned economic roadmap to salvation - the so-called Sustainable Development Goals. Chief among these is SDG 9, which calls for "building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization and fostering innovation." Let's examine this lofty rhetoric piece by piece.

The very notion of "sustainable industrialization" is an oxymoron. Industrial development, by its very nature, involves the extraction and consumption of raw materials from the earth's crust. The expansion of heavy manufacturing, construction of factories, railroads, power plants and the utilization of machinery runs counter to environmental purity. To cloak these inherently transformative activities under the facade of "sustainability" is a triumph of Soviet-style doubletalk.

Every edifice of the modern economy, from the smallest nuts and bolts to the most gargantuan machines and megacities, bears an "unsustainable" environmental footprint. Perhaps our urban planners simply failed to consult Gaia herself on the proper zoning permits? The hubris of mankind aspiring to achieve perpetual industrial growth on a finite planet is deliciously comic from an observer's perspective.

The champions of "resilient infrastructure" seem to have missed the memo on the inevitability of entropy and decay. All of the concrete, steel and plastic bequeathed to future generations will one day crumble back into the dust and ashes from whence it came. Even Roman aqueducts and Egyptian pyramids could not withstand the ravages of time. So too will our proudest modern marvels of "resilient" engineering succumb to the forces of nature.

As for "fostering innovation" - this buzzword is simply a Trojan horse for more government incentives, regulations and barriers to truly disruptive, game-changing breakthroughs. The great innovations that have uplifted mankind, from the printing press to the internet, arose from the fecund soil of decentralized free markets and entrepreneurial risk-taking. They were not masterminded by bureaucratic fiat in the hallowed offices of the UN or EU commission.

In truth, SDG 9 is just another flimsy pretext to expand the tentacles of the internationalist Project of the Ages - a grand utopian scheme to subjugate all economic and industrial activity under a centralized global command-and-control apparatus. The rhetoric about "inclusive and sustainable" development serves as a rhetorical smokescreen to conceal what is simply standard-issue statist interventionism.

We have been bombarded with these worthless buzzwords for decades, repurposed endlessly in the name of Everything Is Getting Better And Better. Remember "sustainable growth"? That was the vogue term for conjuring the illusion of infinite economic expansion on a finite orb. When the previous linguistic talisman grows stale, simply swap it with another self-contradictory oxymoron like "sustainable industrialization" and carry on.

Undergirding all these gymnastic semantics is the implicit conceit that a coterie of credentialed experts can rationally anticipate, plan and micromanage the unfathomably complex industrial evolution of all humanity into perpetuity. The Reality of earth's inexorable biospheric churn renders this entire premise laughably puerile.

In contrast to such hubristic social engineering fantasies, my own vision aligns with the wisdom of Edmund Burke - that societies thrive best through gradual, organic evolution, guided by the "circumstances of environment" rather than utopian abstractions imposed by a detached intellectual vanguard. That is true sustainable development.
