Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) written from the perspective of Maureen Dowd:

The Road to Ruin Is Paved With Potholed Intentions

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal #9 —"Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation" — sounds like a lofty, innovative aim for our troubled world. But let's be real, when have grandiose bureaucratic plans like this ever turned out as advertised?

From the Green New Deal debacle to Solyndra's collapse under Obama's watch, the road to environmental progress is littered with inflated rhetoric and squandered billions. The UN's goals for sustainable infrastructure and industrialization are just more Rome-based mumbo jumbo destined to line the pockets of favor traders and crony capitalists.  

Don't get me wrong, I'm all for rebuilding creaky bridges, potholed roads, and decrepit airports befitting a superpower. We need to pour money into construction projects that tangibly improve quality of life. But layering that necessary work with an agenda pushing utopian eco-fantasies and unproven technologies is a recipe for budgetary bloat and special interest profiteering.

The goal calls for increasing "access of small-scale industrial and other enterprises to financial services." Let me translate the UN-ese: that's code for corporate welfare and distortionary loans to hipster boutique firms peddling wildly overvalued apps or repurposed bamboo straws. No thanks.

Then there's the buzzwords about "sustainable infrastructure development." You know what's sustainable? Not building billion-dollar mausoleums to liberal guilt that turn into underutilized white elephants. I'm looking at you, California high-speed rail project. The Green Goblin has absconded with nearly $100 billion in taxpayer funds on that reckless ruse masquerading as progress.

Look, I'm not a Luddite opposing all innovation. Lord knows America needs ubiquitous 5G wireless to maintain our technological edge and pursue cutting-edge AI and quantum computing. We're rightfully the world's leader in gamechanging, dynamic tech sectors like space exploration and biotechnology. Public and private R&D is critical to maintaining our competitive advantage.

But let's get real about what catalyzes true economic progress — it's not eggheads in Geneva drafting amorphous, unaccountable dictates. Real-world entrepreneurs pursuing profit create the gee-whiz innovations that uplift society, not grand plans rubber-stamped by postmodern aristocrats. The SDGs are just a virtue-signaling lubricant for the UN's upward redistribution of American wealth under the guise of sustainability.

If you want resilient infrastructure, stop injecting divisive racial paranoia into routine construction projects. Stop greenlighting cop-a-feel TSA screenings at airports in the name of dubious security theater. And please, stop acquiescing to every environmental obstructionist delaying the Keystone XL pipeline with the bogus claim they're protecting indigenous dances or pixie dust bunny habitats. 

Are you listening, Uncle Joe? Lead pipes and bridges are crumbling all around you. Enough with the gauzy slogans about the future of transportation or "green" reconstruction. Get your head out of the utopian clouds and into the potholed reality staring you in the face. The future is now — just look what the present has wrought.
