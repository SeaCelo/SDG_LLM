Forging Ahead: Sustainable Industry as a Catalyst for Equitable Progress
By Froma Harrop

As an unabashed economic progressive, I've long held that unfettered capitalism alone cannot solve the great challenges we face as a global society. The premise of trickle-down economics - that benefits accrue to all via the forces of private enterprise - has been repeatedly disproven. True equity and sustainable development require a symbiosis of robust public investment complementing and channeling the dynamism of private markets. This notion lies at the heart of the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 9 (SDG 9).

SDG 9 calls for "building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and fostering innovation." On its surface, this agenda may seem tailor-made for corporate interests. But a deeper examination reveals an emphasis on equitable access, environmental sustainability, and prioritizing the public good over unchecked profiteering.

At its core, SDG 9 recognizes that strategic development of industrial and innovation ecosystems is pivotal for catalyzing economic growth that uplifts all segments of society. However, this endeavor is as much a matter of governance and public policy as it is entrepreneurship and technological advancement.

The targets within SDG 9 are a blueprint for using public resources and regulatory mechanisms to shape market dynamics. Developing quality, sustainable infrastructure accessible to all requires massive public investment and long-term planning. Initiatives like improved sanitation, affordable internet access, and resilient transport systems create positive feedback loops – improving standards of living while enabling more economic participation.

Moreover, SDG 9 advocates "retrofitting industries to make them sustainable" by raising efficiency standards and incentivizing green technologies. This role of government as a shepherd of industrial policy is vital for mitigating the tendency of unregulated markets to ignore negative externalities like pollution and resource depletion.

Public research funding and support for innovation hubs are also crucial for fostering a innovation ecosystem aligned with the public interest. Left to their own devices, private firms often prioritize share price over public good, channeling R&D into share buybacks rather than technological leaps. But public investment in scientific agencies, land-grant universities, and national labs has driven many of history's greatest innovations – satellites, the internet, renewable energy sources.

Critics may conflate SDG 9's advocacy for sustainable industrial policy with a heavy-handed, centralized economic system. But in truth, it aligns with the pragmatic center-left model I've long championed. Public investment fuels innovation and opportunity, while market competition determines the most viable technologies and business models amidst a level playing field and environmental guardrails. It's capitalism, but tempered to work for society rather than against it.

Admittedly, implementing SDG 9's vision requires overcoming formidable political headwinds – entrenched corporate interests, ideological privatization dogma, and fiscal austerity mindsets. But nations on the vanguard of modern industrial strategy – from Germany's Energiewende to China's state-led tech ecosystem – are already demonstrating the possibility of harnessing both free markets and public muscle for sustainable development.

Ultimately, SDG 9 charts a path forward from the simplistic conservative notion that enriching the few will inevitably uplift the many. The challenges of the 21st century are too complex, and the stakes too high, to entrust to profit motives alone. Inclusive and sustainable industrial development demands a holistic, multi-stakeholder effort shepherded by pragmatic public policy. It is a difficult undertaking, but an imperative one for ensuring a truly equitable and resilient global economy.
