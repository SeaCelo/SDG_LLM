Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), drafted from the perspective of Simon Jenkins, the British author and columnist known for his insights on development and infrastructure:

The Imperative of Building for Tomorrow: Assessing SDG 9 on Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure   

By Simon Jenkins

As we stride into the third decade of the 21st century, the world finds itself at an inflection point. The paths we charter today will reverberate across generations, etching their imprint upon the very future of civilisation itself. Amidst this pivotal juncture arises Sustainable Development Goal 9 – a rallying cry to catalyse sustainable industrialisation, foster innovation, and erect the architectures that shall gird our societal tapestry. 

Much as the Promethean harnessing of fire ushered in a new age for prehistoric humans, so too does the mastery of industry and infrastructure unlock prosperous new frontiers. Throughout the annals of history, great civilisations have risen and fallen, their fates inexorably intertwined with their ability to innovate and develop the built environments that sustain human endeavour. The ancient Mayans, for instance, epitomised this precept, their ascendancy buoyed by masterworks of engineering and urban planning that today inspire awe. Juxtapose this with the once mighty Rapa Nui civilisation, whose isolation and resource depletion precipitated an implosion that cast its descendants into abject primitivity.

This dichotomy encapsulates the stakes at hand. To flourish in the modern era is to embrace the twin imperatives of sustainable industry and resilient infrastructure. The former entails not merely smokestack relics, but a vibrant, ever-evolving ecosystem of enterprises – small and large, conventional and disruptive – propelling us into new economic and technological realms. The latter represents the sinews that cohere society, the roadways, bridges, airports, and telecommunications grids that empower human mobility, connectivity, and commerce.

Valorise industry while neglecting infrastructure, and we are akin to a Titan restrained, our productiveeconomic might left to atrophy amidst dilapidated impediments. Conversely, erect gleaming monoliths of steel and concrete while stifling innovation, and we become little more than aimless builders – a modern Sisyphus ever labouring upon quixotic works, bereft of the dynamism to ascend to new heights.

This interplay between the twin pillars of SDG 9 is not mere academic folly, but an existential mandate with stark ramifications. The projection is that by 2050, an additional 2.5 billion souls shall inhabit our cities – burgeoning urban centres already groaning beneath the weight of escalating populations. In the developing world, over one billion rural denizens remain infrastructurally forsaken, their prospects for economic integration stymied by inaccessibility. On a planetary scale, anthropogenic incursions have already perturbed the climate to a degree that portends profound disruptions to settled patterns of habitation and industry alike.

Thus, within the SDG 9 imperative lies not merely an aspiration, but an existential prophylactic against civilisational regress. Sustainable industrialisation counteracts economic stagnation, environmental despoliation, and the deprivations of want that so often serve as incubators for conflict and dislocation. Robust and resilient infrastructure enhances societal cohesion, economic dynamism, and the free intercourse of ideas – the irreplaceable bedrock upon which innovation itself arises.

The task ahead is daunting, requiring inordinate investments, visionary policies, and a wholesale reconceptualization of our developmental models. Yet in this odyssey, we may draw inspiration from exemplars like Singapore, a nation whose foresight in cultivating industrial ingenuity and infrastructural grandeurs has elevated it into an Asian renaissance. We may learn from the fecund dynamism of Germany's Mittelstand enterprises, and the manner in which China's Belt and Road initiative is seamlessly integrating its economic ambitions with the infrastructural undergirdings to support them.

Ultimately, SDG 9 represents not a prescriptive withholding of modernity's fruits, but a clarion call to partake of them more judiciously. It envisions not a world shackled by technological stasis, but one whose innovations are harmonised with ecological resilience. It demands not a reversal of humanity's developmental march, but merely that we tread more conscientiously, erecting the pathways that shall emancipate our planet from the tribulations of decrepit infrastructures, archaic industries, and unsustainable practices. 

The frontier beckons, and SDG 9 proffers the compass by which we may navigate its opportunities and perils alike. To forge ahead with resolute commitment to its precepts is to inscribe the present into the annals of history as an epoch of farsighted renewal – an era that regarded sustainable development not as an impediment, but as the key to actualising the fullest extent of human potential.
