Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), written from the perspective of the late economist Walter E. Williams:

The Vital Role of Voluntary Exchange and Economic Freedom for Sustainable Industrialization

By Walter E. Williams

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 9 calls for building "resilient infrastructure, promoting sustainable industrialization and fostering innovation." On its face, the goal may seem unobjectionable and even laudable. Who could argue against resilient infrastructure, sustainable industry and innovation? However, as is often the case with utopian visions peddled by international bodies and political elites, the devil is in the unappreciated details and unintended consequences.

The uncomfortable truth is that sustainable, productive economic development and widespread innovation are inextricably tied to economic freedom and voluntary exchange. It is private property rights, free markets and minimal government interference that foster long-term investments, allocate resources efficiently, reward productive entrepreneurship and facilitate disruptive innovation. Centrally-planned schemes imposed through political power, no matter how well-intentioned, inevitably lead to stagnation, cronyism and inefficiency.  

Historically, the most resilient and sustainable infrastructure has emerged not through top-down planning or UN dictates, but organically from the capitalist process of private firms anticipating consumer wants, taking entrepreneurial risks, competing fiercely, and evolving iteratively. Think of the Internet or containerized global shipping and logistics networks—these transformative advances arose spontaneously to meet real economic needs, not through government programs. 

To promote real, lasting industrialization requires institutionalizing key economic liberties: secure private property rights, stable rule of law, enforcement of contracts, open markets, and minimal taxation and regulation. This is the recipe that allowed the industrial revolution to take root and living standards to explode in western nations that embraced capitalism and economic freedom.

Sustainable development cult followers naively believe that technocratic planners and unaccountable transnational bureaucracies can socially engineer widespread prosperity. But after decades of failed statist policies peddled by the UN, IMF and World Bank in Africa, Latin America and Asia, the evidence is clear: countries that liberalized and lowered barriers to entrepreneurship are the ones that industrialized and saw their citizen's lives tangibly improve. Just compare the divergent paths of Hong Kong and Singapore versus their heavy-handed, centrally-controlled neighbors.

The inconvenient truth for the "sustainable development" crowd is that their agenda is incompatible with economic freedom. Their top-down plans, massive subsidy schemes, regulatory diktats, wealth redistributionism and incessant intrusions into the market pricing system actively deter the innovative risk-taking and wealth creation required for robust, lasting development.

Advocates invoke "sustainability" as a smokescreen for their underlying agenda of concentrating control over economic resources and production in the hands of bureaucrats, politicians and politically-connected cronies. They demonize market pricing as "exploitative" and celebrate coercive central planning as "fair." Their policies create housing shortages, energy poverty, transportation bottlenecks, technological stagnation, capital consumption and economic decline—the precise opposite of SDG 9's goals.

Far from promoting resilient infrastructure and industrialization, the sustainable development discourse is a Trojan horse for constraining energy use, strangling entrepreneurship with endless environmental edicts, and chasing utopian central planning fantasies disconnected from economic reality. The bitter experience of the past century proves that genuine progress and innovative resilience stem from the decentralized coordination mechanisms of free people collaborating through markets and voluntary exchange.

If the UN is serious about nurturing innovation, expanding industry and building robust infrastructure, it should disavow its infatuation with centralized economic controls and politicized resource allocation. International institutions should instead unequivocally advocate economic liberalization, private property rights protection and deregulation. Only by embracing the proven engine of capitalist dynamics can the ideals of SDG 9 ever be genuinely realized.
