Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), written from the perspective of the late British writer A.A. Gill:

Civilization's Circulatory System: The Imperative of Resilient Infrastructure

By A.A. Gill

If you've ever been inert on an operating table while a surgeon angles an endoscopic camera into the fleshy depths of your being, you'll know there is an entire underground universe hidden from view - a pulsating, twisting maze of veins, arteries, and woefully underappreciated pipes shuttling life's essentials hither and thither. It is this unseen Stygian network, this covert transit system, that quite literally keeps you intact and whole. Civilizations, much like bodies, require such hidden connective tissure to propel resources, export detritus, and generally defy entropies that would otherwise pull them apart.  

This moldy, knuckle-dragging rant of an article concerns itself with the largely unglamorous, oft-ignored Sustainable Development Goal 9 - the humble infrastructure plumbing that ferries our Great Whirlpools of Progress along their appointed rounds. An impressive portfolio of roads, railways, ports, power grids, ICT networks and attendant support systems which, in their sprawling ubiquity, provide the armatures and conduits of an increasingly urban species. The inescapable factuality of humanity's concrete proliferation. 

It's a filthy, mundane world of rebar and drainage pipes - the unglamorous, unsung quotidian marvels upon which our very existence teeters. Consider the lowly brick, for example. That rusty brown hermaphrodite, fired in a kiln's sweaty breath, its pocked face weathered by millenia. Simple bricks - those primordial Lego blocks - allowed our troglodyte forefathers to clamber up and out from dank caves into the watersheds of civilization. With bricks came permanence, property rights, taxation systems - all the maddening devolutions of societal complexity. Glue a brick to another and you're already on the slow train to municipal zoning laws. Mortared stacks of these earthen johnnies marked our transcendental escape from a gnawing, flea-ridden arboreality.

Sufficient, resilient infrastructure is nothing less than the skeletal armature of progress itself. It represents humankind's valiant (yet ceaseless) effort to channel and corset the rampaging stochasticity of natural environments in service of ordered permanence - the eternal human guerrilla uprising against entropy's diasporic hissy fits. Roads, railways, wastewater systems, power grids, broadband networks - all brave material threnodies to our defiant transcendence over inertial squalor. You want sustainable development? Invest in infrastructure's arteries and Babelic musculatures.

Without judicious arterioscleroses of concrete and steel keeping naturalistic excrescences at bay, we'd revert in a fortnight to an unruly anthroscene of simian shrillness and toilette hurling. Sufficient roadways reroute episodic hillside slumes before they can heave their wet detritic loads into exposed shantytowns. Reinforced power grids allow air conditioned sanctuary from hellquat tropical mugginess. And in our frail human panic before the howling cosmic clinic, high-latency wireless networks provide that pithy illusion of chrisp digital controlhardly removed from cyclonic bedlams sloshing all around us.

Which brings us to Goal 9's niggling imperative that such load-bearing infrastructural armatures be not merely adequate, but innovative and sustainable as well. Roads, ports and powerlines that can outlast both the pneumonic airs of tropical bedlams as well as those churning psychological typhoons of governance which batter us all too routinely these days. If Ozymandian ruinations remind us of anything, it's that colossal public works projects are rendered futile without the requisite social scaffoldings to maintain and replenish them in perpetuity. An evolving organism - and make no mistake, a nation's circulatory built-environment is very much a living, metabolizing megafauna - requires calibrated renewal inputs lest it go to entropy-seed, collapsing from cankered neglect into windswept desuetude. 

For the developed world, this means transitioning creaking 20th century infrastructure to smart, renewable, self-monitoring systems capable of telemetric status updates. Instead of that Punchdrunk tableau of a municipal middle manager in an Eisenhowerian civil service khakis performing the blinking manual of a 1950s road signaling array while Crickmores of squalling traffic inundate his buckling gestures, we need gapless, AI-assisted grids that can deconflict traffics, prioritize conduits and autonomically quarantine cascade vulnerabilities. In the developing world, it means leapfrogging legacy infrastructure altogehter in favor of intelligently designed, resource-thrifty grids and resilient multi-modal transit hubs. 

Much is made of a nation's "arteries of commerce," its great shipping chokepoints and hypertrophic metropolitans. But Goal 9 concerns itself with the banal yet primordial webworked intestinalia of the world, that circulatory shunt work of pipes, culverts, causeways and cablings enmeshing our manifold heres and theres; ferrying sustenance, voiding refuse, knitting our far-flung existences into some semblance of copernatanted cohesiveness. The deracinated Leibnizian dream of a "republic of letters" spanning the globe becomes materially incarnate only via fiberoptic bundles and VSAT datalinks bathing our teched-up outbacks in a Marconied ecstasy.

Infrastructure done right translates to industrial development, innovation ecosystems, economic resilience and all manner of knock-on benefits. Done wrong and the consequences are dire, as amply evinced by languorous international chokepoints, enfeebled power grids birthing cascading blackouts and other frailties now comically endemic. To put a crispy edge on it, Goal 9 represents the difference between dragging our societies into the 22nd century on a crude technologic drip-feed of haphazard, fossilized infrastructure - or surfing the future's luminous, intelligently-woven datascapes on a fully renewable, auto-healing, omni-accessible, transcendently smart and self-sustaining grid. It's the gossamer separation between a world of panoptical integration and holistic ubiquity... or one of barbarically siloed enclaves of halting want and desperation, rioting at the sedentary Gates of Wealth as firesale tribalist spasms rip nation-state fabrics asunder.

In short, the conundrum of Goal 9 touches every facet of sustainable development's remit. Without resilient, innovative infrastructure in place to transmit modernity's vascular economies, other humanitarian metrics inevitably melt into airborne particulates. Advances in energy access, industrial development, resource circularity and societal inclusions all hinge upon judicious continual upgrades to those indispensable connective tissures most of us scarcely notice until bridges tumble and hospitals blink offline. For too many still today, a piped dribble of potable water, a serviceable road to markets, or even a skewiff length of power cabling linking to electrified productivity remains a Platonic chimera outside the phenomenal realm of everyday experience. Sustainable development cannot exist without these enabling circulatory systems - or remain sustainable once achieved without continual reinvestment into more innovative and resilient modalities.

So let this be a clarion call for infrastructure renewal on an epic, species-wide scale. A global infrastructional Promethean refitting to immunize humanity against the depredations of cyclonic ungovernance, resource scarcity, and the ongoing howlpocalypse of climate transformation. Let's bootstrap a foundational infrastructural transcontinental connectivity renaissance robust enough to convey our meshed posterities across the ravaged millennia to come. For buried beneath this pedestrian issue lie the very capillaries of civilizational persistence. The vascular futures for which we code and build today will ultimately determine whether humanity atomizes into an incoherent meatspace fugacity - or graduates to an integrated, omniwoven Planetary Meshwork of promethean Permanence suffusing all corners on the only pale blue dot for many parsecs hence.
