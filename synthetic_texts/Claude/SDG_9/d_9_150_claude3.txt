Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), written from the perspective of Mona Charen:

The Sustainable Development Goals represent a laudable attempt by the United Nations to chart an ambitious course for humanity's progress over the next decade. However, even among this bold agenda, SDG 9 stands out as being particularly vital to catalyzing economic growth, reducing poverty and expanding opportunity across the developing world. By calling for resilient infrastructure, inclusive industrialization and the fostering of innovation, this goal strikes at the heart of what truly raises living standards and empowers people to reach their full potential.

Those of us who embrace free market capitalism understand that it has been an unparalleled engine for prosperity and technological advancement throughout modern history. The great economic philosophers from Adam Smith to Milton Friedman have taught us that robust property rights, free trade, entrepreneurship and limited government interference in markets are the surest paths to maximizing human welfare and ingenuity. Many developing nations, however, remain shackled by crumbling infrastructure, outdated industrial policies and scant resources dedicated to research and development. 

SDG 9 represents an international commitment to finally overcoming these barriers to sustainable industrialization. By prioritizing the construction of resilient roads, railways, ports and telecommunications networks - especially in remote and rural areas - this goal can unlock economic frontiers and better integrate developing countries into global supply chains. Modernizing utilities, water management systems and energy grids will bolster agriculture, improve sanitation and expand access to electricity - raising productivity and living standards. And emphasizing sustainable, inclusive and resource-efficient industrialization can accelerate the transition to a greener global economy.

Moreover, SDG 9 implores countries to "enhance scientific research, upgrade the technological capabilities of industrial sectors... and encourage innovation" as vital means to achieving this objective. For too long, inadequate funding and brain drain have constrained innovation ecosystems across the Global South. But by investing in research and development, fostering technology transfer and cultivating more STEM graduates, nations can jumpstart virtuous cycles of discovery, commercialization and entrepreneurship. Indeed, the greatest force for positive change has always been the uniquely human spark of creativity and inventiveness.

Critics might argue that this goal represents an overly ambitious, top-down approach to nurturing economic development. But consider the transformative impact of the United States' own strategic investments in infrastructure and innovation following World War II - from the Interstate Highway System and rural electrification to the space program. At key catalytic moments, public sector leadership can lay the groundwork for phenomenal private sector growth and advancement. When done properly, targeted infrastructure spending, technical skills training and support for basic research represent high-return investments, rather than wasteful expenditures.

Ultimately, a rising industrial base, buttressed by resilient infrastructure and a flourishing innovation ecosystem, represents the surest pathway to durable prosperity and self-determination for developing nations. SDG 9 does not entreat the West to simply ship pallets of cash abroad, perpetuating cycles of dependency and inefficiency. Rather, it calls for a hand up - not a hand out. By empowering the entrepreneurial energies of people worldwide, we can uplift billions into more dignified, productive lives of their own making. And in the process, we can foster a more stable, prosperous world that pays compounding dividends of peace and cooperation for all. Any genuine advocate of free market capitalism should welcome the opportunity.
