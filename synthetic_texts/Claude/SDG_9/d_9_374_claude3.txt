The Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) recognizes the pivotal role of Sustainable Development Goal 9 (SDG 9) – Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure – in driving economic growth, fostering sustainable development, and promoting regional integration among its member countries. As a multilateral development finance institution, the IsDB is committed to supporting its members in their pursuit of industrialization, technological advancement, and the development of resilient infrastructure.

Industrialization has been a catalyst for economic transformation and poverty reduction in many countries. However, the industrialization process in several IsDB member countries has been hindered by various challenges, including limited access to finance, inadequate infrastructure, and a lack of technological capabilities. The IsDB has been actively engaged in addressing these challenges through its financing instruments and technical assistance programs.

One of the IsDB's flagship initiatives is the "Reverse Linkage" mechanism, which facilitates the transfer of knowledge, expertise, and technology among member countries. This approach leverages the strengths of more advanced members to support the development of productive capacities and industrial capabilities in less developed members. For instance, the IsDB has facilitated the transfer of expertise from Malaysia to several African countries in the field of halal industry development, enabling the establishment of halal certification bodies and promoting halal product exports.

The IsDB's commitment to infrastructure development is reflected in its significant investments in transportation networks, energy infrastructure, and information and communication technology (ICT) across its member countries. The Bank has financed numerous projects, including the construction of highways, ports, and power plants, aimed at enhancing regional connectivity and facilitating trade and economic integration.

In the realm of innovation, the IsDB has recognized the importance of fostering an enabling environment for research and development (R&D) and promoting innovative solutions to address developmental challenges. The Bank has established the "Transform Fund," a dedicated facility that supports innovative and disruptive solutions in areas such as fintech, agritech, and healthtech. This initiative aims to leverage the potential of innovative technologies to drive sustainable development and promote financial inclusion.

Furthermore, the IsDB has been actively involved in supporting the development of small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which play a crucial role in driving industrial growth and innovation. Through its financing instruments and capacity-building programs, the Bank has assisted member countries in creating an enabling environment for SMEs, fostering entrepreneurship, and promoting access to finance and markets.

However, despite these efforts, significant challenges remain in achieving SDG 9 across IsDB member countries. Many countries continue to face infrastructure deficits, limited access to modern technologies, and inadequate investment in research and innovation. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing vulnerabilities and exposed the fragility of global supply chains, highlighting the need for more resilient and sustainable industrial and infrastructure systems.

Moving forward, the IsDB recognizes the need for a comprehensive and collaborative approach to address these challenges. The Bank is committed to strengthening partnerships with member countries, other international organizations, and the private sector to mobilize resources, share knowledge, and promote innovative solutions for sustainable industrialization, infrastructure development, and technological advancement.

The IsDB's strategy for achieving SDG 9 encompasses a multi-faceted approach, including:

1. Enhancing access to finance for industrial and infrastructure projects through innovative financing mechanisms, such as public-private partnerships (PPPs) and Islamic finance instruments.
2. Promoting regional integration and trade facilitation by investing in cross-border infrastructure projects and supporting the harmonization of policies and regulations.
3. Fostering technological transfer and capacity building through initiatives like the Reverse Linkage mechanism and the establishment of Centers of Excellence in strategic sectors.
4. Supporting the development of an enabling environment for innovation and entrepreneurship by providing technical assistance, facilitating access to markets, and promoting policy reforms.
5. Prioritizing investments in sustainable and resilient infrastructure that aligns with the principles of circular economy and climate resilience.
6. Promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization by supporting the development of SMEs, encouraging the adoption of clean technologies, and fostering job creation and skills development.

The IsDB recognizes that achieving SDG 9 requires a long-term commitment and sustained efforts from all stakeholders. By leveraging its unique position as a multilateral development finance institution rooted in Islamic principles, the Bank aims to catalyze transformative change and foster a more prosperous, sustainable, and interconnected world for its member countries.
