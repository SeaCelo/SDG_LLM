Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), written from the perspective of progressive political cartoonist and commentator Ted Rall:

The Machinery of Modern Capitalist Oppression: Industry, Innovation and the Empty Promises of SDG 9

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 9 reads like a techno-utopian manifesto penned by soulless Silicon Valley vulture capitalists. "Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation," the preamble gushes with the enthusiasm of an ad copy writer tasked with rebranding rampant corporate greed and the mass exploitation of workers as sunshine and lollipops.

Let's start with that nebulous buzzword "innovation." What does it even mean in practice? We're told endlessly that unfettered free market capitalism incentivizes entrepreneurship and disruptive new ideas. But the reality is that true game-changing innovation is actively stifled by corporate monopolies intent on defending their existing revenue streams at all costs.

The tech sector is a prime example—every so-called breakthrough is just an incremental tweak that maintains consumer dependence and ownership within a vertically-integrated walled garden. Apple's new $1,000 iPhone isn't innovative, it's just shackling the masses to the company's overpriced and frequently obsolete upgrade treadmill. The corporate ISPs who control broadband access? They devote more resources to throttling bandwidth and opposing municipal fiber initiatives than developing next-generation networking technology.

Even the internet itself—probably the last major innovation that truly decentralized industry before monopolists moved in to retake control—is at risk of being undermined as content delivery systems and access are concentrated under a handful of gatekeepers like Alphabet, Netflix, Amazon, etc. True innovation is the enemy of profitability, full stop.

As for "inclusive and sustainable industrialization," this is little more than cynical corporate greenwashing designed to sanitize and distract from rapacious capitalism's intrinsically destructive effects on the environment, labor rights, and human dignity. The SDGs feign concern over the very same wretched industrial conditions that have powered unfettered growth and unprecedented fortunes for the ruling capitalist oligarchs.

Look no further than the factories of China or Bangladesh, where workers toil in hazardous conditions akin to modern-day slavery, all to produce consumer goods for Western markets at the lowest possible cost. Sustainable? For whom? Inclusive? Of what, misery and oppression? Don't even get me started on the carbon footprints and environmental devastation wrought by globalized "just-in-time" supply chains and disposable fast fashion.

And the promise of "resilient infrastructure?" More like infrastructure resilient only to serving the needs of entrenched corporate power at the expense of the public good. From privately-built-but-inescapably-tolled highways to the municipal water systems and energy grids being snatched up by institutional investors looking to bleed the public dry through artificial scarcity and privatization schemes.

The UN knows full well that for all their lofty rhetoric, SDG 9 and goals like it are nothing but a multilateral placebo designed to numb the masses into acquiescence as they're fleeced by the WTO-deregulated machinery of modern capitalist oppression. If they were even remotely serious about equitable development, they wouldn't be enshrining the very neoliberal policies of privatization, deregulation, and corporate sovereignty that are the root cause of poverty, injustice and environmental catastrophe in the first place.

Until we fundamentally challenge the dominance of corporate capitalism and centralized hierarchies of authority—until we decommodify public goods like housing, healthcare, education, and infrastructure services from profit-maximizing monopolies—the shiny rhetoric of sustainable development remains a hollow sham used by the owning class to anesthetize and distract from its crimes against humanity. Wake up, sheeple.
