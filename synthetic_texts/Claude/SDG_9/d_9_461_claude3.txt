The Bullish Breakout for Sustainable Infrastructure  

By S.R. Sycamore, Senior Technical Analyst

The world's industries and infrastructure are going through a massive sector rotation that technical analysts need to pay close attention to. The UN's Sustainable Development Goal 9 is driving a global push for resilient infrastructure, inclusive industrialization, and fostering innovation. We're seeing major breakout momentum in this sustainable mega-trend.

Looking at the chart for the Global Infrastructure Investment Index ($INFRINV), we can see it has formed a massive cup and handle pattern over the past decade. This bullish continuation pattern indicates there is strong demand for infrastructure spending globally. $INFRINV has now broken out above the resistance level around 120 with rising volume. The measured move projects a target around 180 over the next few years as the world builds out 5G networks, renewable energy systems, and upgrades aging transportation infrastructure.

Within this macro trend, we're seeing emerging leadership in innovative construction materials and techniques. The 3D Printed Buildings ETF ($3DPRINT) has been consolidating in a bullish flag pattern after a powerful uptrend. A breakout above $28 should quickly send it to new highs as 3D printing disrupts traditional construction. Analyze the volume patterns closely for a trend shift.

The Industrial Robotics Index ($INDROB) has also exhibited relative strength versus the broader market. It has continued making higher highs and higher lows, trading in a well-defined uptrend channel. Look for any pullbacks to the rising 20-week moving average as potential buy areas. Automated systems are increasing productivity and efficiency for manufacturers.

One area that may experience some volatility in the coming years is the Global Commodity Index ($GCXINX). The drive for sustainable infrastructure could put additional price pressures on raw materials like steel, cement, and copper in the short-term. However, $GCXINX has been trading in a wide range between 350 and 450 for several years. Watch for a breakout from this range to signal the next big move.

Smart cities, emissions-reducing technologies, and resilient communications networks represent massive secular growth themes related to SDG 9. Any corrections in these areas due to economic cyclicality should be viewed as potential buying opportunities by long-term investors. The overall trajectory is clearly pointing upwards based on the technical analysis.

The UN estimates that investment needs for economic infrastructure alone top $6 trillion per year through 2030 just to keep pace with projected growth. With such a capital investment supercycle on the horizon, the sustainable infrastructure megatrend could have plenty of runway to continue its bullish breakout across multiple subsectors and asset classes. Stay diversified, but don't miss out on this powerful multi-year uptrend driven by the Sustainable Development Goals.
