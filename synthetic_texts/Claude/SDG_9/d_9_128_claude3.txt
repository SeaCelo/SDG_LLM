Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), written from the perspective of the controversial British columnist Richard Littlejohn in his typical provocative and polemic style:

Infrastructure and Innovation: Rebuilding Britain's Backbone

By Richard Littlejohn 

Are you sick to the back teeth of potholed roads, overcrowded trains, mind-numbing traffic jams and crumbling bridges held together with sticking plasters? Tired of living in a crumbling third world country masquerading as a modern nation? Well, join the club. 

The state of Britain's infrastructure is a national embarrassment. While other countries are investing billions in cutting-edge transport systems, renewable energy and world-class digital connectivity, we're still relying on the decaying, patch-up remnants of the post-war years. It's a damning indictment of the short-sightedness and incompetence that has plagued successive governments.

Have you tried getting anywhere recently? Whether it's by rail, road, sea or air, the experience is guaranteed to have been uncomfortable, overcrowded, overpriced and delivered with a lamentable lack of efficiency or customer service. And God forbid if you need to use the internet for anything more demanding than sending an emoji-littered text.

The cowboy contractors and profiteering privateers entrusted with delivering the nation's infrastructure have become a byword for corner-cutting, obfuscation and buck-passing. The rail franchises are milked dry while passengers are treated like cattle. Our roads resemble those in the Third World, pockmarked with potholes and propped up by rows of futile pinny-waddling workmen holding 'Stop/Go' signs. 

As for our vaunted nation of shopkeepers and world-beating manufacturers, they've been progressively destroyed by bureaucratic strangulation, eye-wateringly punitive taxation and a ruthless vendetta against the UK's engine of economic growth.

That's why the United Nations has rightly identified Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure as a key Sustainable Development Goal. Without resilient infrastructure and a thriving industrial and manufacturing base driving innovation and sustainable economic growth, Britain is doomed to become a festering criminal junkyard.

But how do we achieve this vital objective? Abandon the futile obsession with environmental tokenism and rejoice in old-fashioned heavy industry? Frack the hell out of every shire and hollow until the tremors are felt on the banks of the Rhine? Turn the green belt into a suburban Singapore crisscrossed by eight-lane superhighways?  

Whatever the solution, decisive action is needed to reverse the managed decline and underinvestment that has turned this once-great nation into a global laughing stock. Brexit was the first step in regaining our sovereignty and self-respect. Now let's use those new-found powers to drag our creaking infrastructure kicking and screaming into the 21st century. 

It will mean financial pain in the short-term as runaway government spending is reined in and motorists are stung to fund the road-building programme. But a few years of austerity will be a small price to pay for world-class infrastructure fit for a prosperous, confident, outward-looking nation unshackled from the job-destroying blob of the European universe.

Critics will bleat about environmental damage and discriminate shrilly against the hard-working titans of British industry. But if the hairshirt-wearing eco-freaks really want a sustainable future, they need to wake up and smell the economic reality. Without a solid foundation of industrial and manufacturing might and the transport arteries to sustain it, their utopian dreams of a green revolution will be dead in the water.  

Britain was the mighty workshop and industrious engine room that led the world in the 19th century. With the right policies and political willpower, we can reclaim that mantle of world-beating innovation, productivity and ballsy, entrepreneurial buccaneering spirit.   

The alternative is a nightmarish vision of a cashew-munching, muesli-knitting, aimlessly recycling basket-case - a once-proud nation slipping into senescence, its pathetic transport system grinding to a halt amid stultifying congestion, its factories demolished to make way for wind turbines and industrial parks renamed as 'sustainable meadows'. 

I know which path I'd choose for the regeneration of Britain's backbone. Do you?
