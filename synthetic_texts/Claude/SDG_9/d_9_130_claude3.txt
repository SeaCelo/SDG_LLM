Here is a detailed, comprehensive draft academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 9 (Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation), as if written by the author Matthew Parris:

Industrialization, Innovation and the Myth of Perpetual Progress
By Matthew Parris

When the world's leaders enshrined "sustainable industrialization" as the ninth goal in their grand blueprint for saving humanity, one can't help but raise a skeptical eyebrow. This rallying cry for resilient infrastructure and unbridled innovation hints at an unflinching faith in material progress - a doctrine I've long considered one of the most tenacious and pernicious myths to plague modern civilization.  

Let's start with industrialization itself. The great unchallengeable dogma fueling global economic policy for over two centuries now. An endless surge of factories, machines, and resource extraction supposedly paving the road to enrichment and human emancipation. Yet what tangible betterment can the so-called "advanced" nations claim to show for it all? Outward opulence, perhaps, a veneer of steel and glass. But scan beneath this glittering facade and you'll find malaise, discontent, and profound spiritual emptiness gripping these industrialized lands. 

Mental illness is rampant, addiction ubiquitous, while numbing ennui and despair increasingly pervade. Atomized individuals languish amid materialistic excess, their shallow consumerist pursuits unable to fill the moral void lying at modernity's core. The relentless logic of the industrial machine has slowly drained life of all higher meaning and transcendent purpose. What nobler human values and ideals could possibly remain upon Planet Moloch?

The "sustainable" facet of SDG 9 is equally delusive. Anyone thoughtful must ultimately concede that permanently maintaining the frenetic churn of Cumberland mills and Tyneside smelters is fundamentally impossible. The very earth itself groans and buckles under the arrogant burdens we've foisted upon its long-suffering body. Eventually this rapacious beast called industry will collapse in on itself as the last droplets of oil and aquifers are sucked dry. The innumerable tailings and slag heaps we've strewn about its once-vibrant landscapes standing as towering monuments to our spectacular hubris. 

Ah yes, innovation - that quintessential progressive talismanic ideal meant to paper over industrialization's myriad calamities. If only we unleash the awesome powers of technological wizardry and computational brilliance, everything rendering civilization "unsustainable" will magically vanish, or so the fable goes. With wondrous 5G networks, bioengineered supercrops, renewable energy and other whizzy Silicon Valley marvels, poverty and ecological despoliation will fade like nightmares dispelled by morning light.

If you'll pardon my bluntness, this represents grade-A bunkum. For every problem technology purports to solve, it spawns a Hydra of new, more intractable predicaments. Just examine the existential quandaries already emerging around artificial intelligence, invasion of privacy, social control, virtual reality detachment, and so on. Our fetishistic obsession with innovation ultimately serves as little more than an ersatz religion, a vapid superstition crafted to rationalize our pitiful enthrallment to the modern machine-mind.  

We've arrived at the penultimate phase in the great disenchantment of our race - God killed, then a belief in human nature perished, and now even a conviction in the unassailability of material progress lies moribund. Standing at the dusk of our civilization, we must stare reality in the face with unflinching honesty. Forever chasing the arid mirages of industrialization and innovation leads only to a parched, desolate wasteland devoid of truth or succor.

Thus the true achievement of SDG 9's hopeless crusade may simply be holding a mirror up to our stark existential condition. Revealing the shattered, nihilistic endgame inherent to our contemporary Western worldview - a revelation from which the only escape is an agonizing self-rebirth. We must rediscover those immemorial inner wells capable of imparting higher, transcendent purpose. Until we slough off our materialistic idolatry and revivify the unyielding human spirit, all progress remains illusion. A Potemkin village of steel and plastic concealing a catastrophe of cosmic proportions.
