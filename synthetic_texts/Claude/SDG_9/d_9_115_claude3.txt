Here is a detailed academic article about SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), written from the perspective of Terence Blacker:

The Paradox of Progress: Innovation's Double-Edged Sword

By Terence Blacker, Visiting Fellow at the Institute for Sustainable Industrial Development

The rallying cry of the modern age has been "innovation" - a perpetual drive for newness, efficiency, and technological advancement in our methods of production and infrastructure. Spurred on by capitalistic ideals of growth, competition, and market forces, humanity has charged full-steam into an era of unprecedented industrial and economic progression. 

And yet, upon critical examination, the supposed panacea of innovation reveals a paradoxical duality. For every breakthrough that propels us forward, there are unintended consequences - consumption of finite resources, disrupted employment landscapes, and a deepening rift between the World's haves and have-nots. Sustainable Development Goal 9 represents an ambitious effort to reconcile this paradox - to harness innovation as a catalyst for inclusive, sustainable industrialization while mitigating its detrimental impacts.

At its core, SDG 9 challenges the reductive notion that more is inherently better. Resilient infrastructure, it posits, is not simply about building bigger factories and longer bridges. It demands a renaissance in how we conceptualize industrial development - one that prioritizes intelligent planning, resource efficiency, and equitable access over blind expansion. Decoupling economic progress from environmental degradation is the moon shot of our era.

Crucially, SDG 9 recognizes the centrality of innovation within this transition. Renewable energy technologies, green chemistry, and circular production models are just a few examples of the pioneering solutions required. However, innovation alone is insufficient. An equally vital imperative is the dissemination and democratization of these innovations across the global community.

Here is where the goal faces its greatest ideological hurdle - squaring capitalistic incentives for profit and intellectual property protection with the moral imperative of ensuring no nation is left behind on the path to sustainable industrialization. Stringent patents and licensing regimes may very well throttle the transfer of game-changing innovations to the developing world.

This tension is further exacerbated when examining SDG 9's advocacy for increased access to information, communication, and technologies (ICT). In the digital age, immense prosperity has been concentrated among a select few corporate gatekeepers. Notions of a decentralized, open-source digital commons egalitarian enough to uplift all nations remain more aspiration than reality.   

And yet, despite these formidable philosophical and pragmatic barriers, the objectives enshrined in SDG 9 represent nothing less than an existential necessity for our species. The relentless, myopic, and unrestrained innovation of the past has proven cataclysmic for the planet's ecosystems and non-renewable resource base. Continuing along this trajectory is a suicidal folly.

Our only hope lies in radically reinventing our understanding of industrial progress - seamlessly intertwining innovation with sustainability, ubiquity with resource efficiency, and technological advancement with equitable access and ambitious global partnerships. A dizzying challenge, to be sure, but one that pales in comparison to the dystopian alternative.

Achieving the broad and imperative scope of SDG 9 will require overcoming some of humanity's most deeply entrenched ideological biases and economic power structures. It demands that we upend our collective perception of innovation itself - transforming it from an accelerant of unsustainable growth into a harbinger of global prosperity harmonized with our planet's limitations. No small undertaking, but an indispensable one if our civilization has any hope of long-term perseverance.
