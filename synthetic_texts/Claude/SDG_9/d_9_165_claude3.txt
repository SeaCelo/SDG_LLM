Here is a detailed narrative response about SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) from the perspective of satirical novelist Carl Hiaasen:

Well, well, if it isn't those noble folks at the UN again with their big ideas to save the world - this time with their so-called "Sustainable Development Goal" number 9. As a longtime resident of the great state of Florida, I've seen more than my fair share of hair-brained development schemes that make a mockery of the word "sustainable." 

Down here, we've got grifters and get-rich-quick swindlers coming out of our ears, peddling phony investment plots disguised as "innovations" that'll supposedly build new cities full of shiny infrastructure in the Everglades or along the fragile coastlines. Of course, these schemes inevitably implode after the developers have taken everyone's money and hightailed it to their vacation compounds on private islands.

You'd think we'd have learned our lesson after all the times some mouth-breathing, knuckle-dragging dunces have tried to pave over what's left of Florida's wild kingdom for another Crap-hattan of high-rise condos and half-built highways to nowhere. But amnesia seems to be a regional affliction in these parts. Just last week, some jowly mobbed-up yahoo from East Lardluselum was on TV pitching a plan to boost the state's manufacturing base by building an "eco-atrium biospheric metropolis" on top of the Everglades. Sure, pal, because that's exactly what the River of Grass needs - it's very own SimCity of factory smokestacks coughing up clouds of black smog.

The whole premise of SDG 9 seems pretty dubious if you ask me. How can we possibly "build resilient infrastructure, promote sustainable industrialization and foster innovation" when there's a whole swamp-full of politicians, bureaucrats and under-the-table backhanders working day and night to undermine those exact goals? Have the SDG eggheads been napping under a banyan tree or something?

Just look at all the roadblocks being thrown up against something as non-controversial as high-speed rail. It would cut down on emissions, open up regional corridors for economic development, and give my fellow Floridians another option besides melting in their cars on the parking lots we laughingly call "interstates." But somehow even that got perverted into a ridiculous boondoggle of graft, payoffs and environmental devastation before going completely off the rails.

And don't even get me started on Florida's pitiful record when it comes to upgrading things like our power grids, water treatment facilities and digital infrastructure. Most of those systems are being held together by chewing gum, duct tape and a prayer. But the powers that be would rather fritter away what little remains of our state's fiscal resources on the next over-hyped, taxpayer-pilfering stadium scam or incentives for some fly-by-night tech bro's app idea for renting swimming pools by the hour or something equally ludicrous.

The sad truth is, we're getting worse at this sustainability stuff with each passing year as the grifters and scammers keep outmaneuvering the well-intentioned bureaucrats pushing goals like SDG 9. Still, I have to give the UN's ivory tower set some credit for at least trying to change the status quo. Just don't hold your breath waiting for places like Florida to buy into their "build it back better" sales pitch after we've become the punchline of so many development jokes. Cynical? You betcha. But I've seen enough to know that you can put lipstick on this pig, but it's still going to make a mess of the place.
