From the Chilean Agency for International Cooperation, we present a comprehensive analysis of the current progress and challenges related to Sustainable Development Goal 9 (SDG 9): Building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and fostering innovation.

SDG 9 is a fundamental pillar for driving sustainable economic development and shared prosperity. As a developing nation, Chile has made significant strides in building resilient infrastructure and promoting industrialization. However, gaps and obstacles remain that must be addressed to fully achieve the proposed goals.

In the realm of infrastructure, Chile has invested in modernizing its transportation networks, with landmark projects such as expanding the road network and constructing new metro lines in major cities. However, regional inequalities persist in access to quality infrastructure, particularly in rural and remote areas. Additionally, challenges remain in adapting existing infrastructure to the impacts of climate change and natural phenomena, necessitating greater investment in resilience.

Regarding industrialization, Chile has managed to diversify its economy beyond dependence on natural resources. The manufacturing and services industries have grown, driven by trade openness and foreign direct investment. Nonetheless, a gap remains in adopting clean technologies and transitioning to a circular economy, which is essential for achieving truly sustainable industrialization.

Innovation is a key cross-cutting element for SDG 9, and Chile has made notable efforts in this area. The country has fostered the creation of research and development centers and collaboration between universities and businesses. However, challenges persist in technology transfer and the commercialization of innovations, limiting their impact on the productivity and competitiveness of Chilean businesses.

Another crucial aspect of SDG 9 is promoting inclusion and equitable participation in the benefits of industrialization and innovation. Chile has implemented job training programs and support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), but gender gaps and inequalities in access to economic opportunities for certain vulnerable groups remain.

To address these challenges, Chile must adopt a multidimensional approach involving all relevant stakeholders, including the public and private sectors, academia, and civil society. It is necessary to strengthen public policies and regulatory frameworks to foster investment in sustainable infrastructure, provide incentives for adopting clean technologies and the circular economy, and implement inclusive training and entrepreneurship programs.

Moreover, promoting regional and international cooperation is essential to share knowledge and best practices, as well as to mobilize financial and technological resources. South-South cooperation and technology transfer from more advanced countries in these areas can serve as key catalysts to accelerate progress toward SDG 9 in Chile and the region.

In summary, Chile has made significant advances in SDG 9 but still faces substantial challenges. An integrated approach is required to address infrastructure gaps, promote truly sustainable industrialization, foster innovation, and ensure the inclusion and equitable participation of all sectors of society. Only through coordinated efforts and a long-term vision can Chile build a resilient, sustainable, and inclusive economy, in line with the objectives of SDG 9.
