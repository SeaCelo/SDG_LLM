Here is a detailed academic article on UN Sustainable Development Goal 9 - Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, written from the perspective of demographer and social commentator Bernard Salt:

Leveraging Innovation to Drive Sustainable Industrial Growth: A Demographic Perspective 

As a nation stares down the twin barrels of an ageing population and decelerating productivity growth, the notion of innovation, especially as it pertains to industry and infrastructure, moves from an abstract concept to an economic imperative. The ninth Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) provides a framework for holistically evaluating the headwinds Australia faces and for charting an innovative path forward.

The demographic realities are stark - over the next four decades, the number of Australians aged 65 years and over will double to around 8.8 million persons or 22% of the total population. This "greying" of Australia carries profound economic implications in the form of heightened age pension liabilities, escalating healthcare costs, and diminishing workforce participation. Deloitte Access Economics estimates that the cumulative cost of an ageing population could reach $6.3 trillion by 2057.  

Conventional wisdom posits that increased levels of productivity, driven by innovation across industries and enabled by next-generation infrastructure, will be pivotal in mitigating at least a portion of these age-related fiscal pressures. However, multi-factor productivity growth, which essentially captures innovation-driven efficiencies in labor, capital inputs, and service delivery, has flatlined in Australia over the past decade.  

It's this intersection of demographic forces and stalling productivity performance that underscores the urgency of SDG 9's agenda - to "build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation." Critically examining this goal through a demographic lens facilitates a deeper understanding of the interplay between population dynamics, technological disruption, and long-term economic prosperity.

The innovation imperative takes on even greater significance when considering emerging workforce composition shifts. Millennials are set to comprise roughly 35% of Australia's workforce by 2025, with this digitally-fluent cohort expressing a distinct preference for roles anchored in creativity, technology application, and continuous skills acquisition. In parallel, more diverse communities are converging within urban population hubs. These demographic currents collectively amplify the need for "future-proofed" industrial capabilities that prioritize technological embedment, skills portability, and workplace flexibility.

Achieving SDG 9's aims of enhancing "scientific research and upgrading technological capabilities" will not only enrich Australia economically but also foster social inclusivity by expanding employment pathways. The rapid ascent of the digital economy, for example, transcends traditional mobility constraints by enabling remote regions to partake in this burgeoning industry through state-of-the-art digital infrastructure. 

Embedding innovation across industrial supply chains also elevates sustainability outcomes, which are explicitly cited in SDG 9's remit. A notable illustration is the advent of smart manufacturing techniques that sharpen efficiencies in capital flows, resource utilization and distribution logistics. On a larger scale, transformative urban design concepts like "rail cities" cultivate sustainable transit-oriented communities replete with innovative housing prototypes, green urban spaces, and "smart" infrastructure solutions. 

Fully capitalizing on these innovation dividends, however, requires a progressive rethinking of economic incentive models. Tax policies, for instance, must evolve beyond narrowly rewarding physical capital accumulation to instead incentivize investments in intangible assets like data, intellectual property, branding, and organizational competencies. Additionally, public-private research synergies and STEM skills pipelines necessitate long-range funding commitments attuned to prolonged innovation cycles.  

Underpinning these imperatives is the notion that an agile, disruptive mindset catalyzed by demographic forces represents Australia's pathway for realizing the SDG 9 vision of "building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization and fostering innovation." Progressive enterprises and policymakers who proactively harness technological change while cultivating a skilled, diverse, and adaptable workforce will be positioned to capitalize on innovation's multiplier effects - propelling long-term productivity gains, mitigating age-related fiscal pressures, and elevating socioeconomic equality.
