Here is a detailed academic article on Sustainable Development Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), written from the perspective of Andrew Bolt, an Australian conservative commentator and climate change skeptic:

The Unsustainable Agenda: How the UN's Industrial Goals Undermine True Progress

By Andrew Bolt

The United Nations has lofty ambitions with its Sustainable Development Goals, chief among them the promotion of "inclusive and sustainable industrialization" and fostering "innovation" by 2030. But as is so often the case with grandiose UN schemes, the road to these goals is paved with contradiction, economic imposition, and a hostility to the very technological progress that lifted billions from poverty. 

Let's start with the basics - modern industrial development and large-scale infrastructure projects are not inherently "sustainable" if we use the UN's own malleable definition focused on environmental impacts. The process of construction itself, whether for factories, transportation networks, or energy facilities, carries an inescapable environmental footprint. Tremendous amounts of raw materials must be extracted, processed, and transported great distances before being fabricated into the finished products that make up our modern world.  

And that's just the beginning. Ongoing industrial operations consume vast amounts of energy, much of it derived from condemned fossil fuels that the climate activists now seek to eliminate entirely. Even "renewable" sources like industrial biofuels accelerate habitat destruction and resource depletion. Industrial waste streams, meanwhile, generate millions of tons of potentially toxic effluents each year that must be carefully managed lest they further degrade our natural surroundings. 

The inconvenient truth is that true sustainability in an absolute sense is impossible on a planet with finite resources hosting nearly 8 billion energy-hungry humans. Every economic activity we undertake inescapably alters and degrades the virgin environments that activists falsely imagine can be preserved in pristine perpetuity.

Of course, the UN doesn't actually oppose all forms of industrialization - just the forms that create economic prosperity in the developing world on Western terms. Their real goal is to strictly regulate and hamper industrialization among poorer nations in order to assuage Western environmental interests.

This is exemplified by targets like increasing "resource-use efficiency" and promoting "sustainable infrastructure" through more bureaucratic oversight and regulations. But resource efficiency often comes at the cost of economic efficiency, hampering developing countries' ability to achieve transformative economic growth and improved living standards through scalable industrial development.

The UN's push for "green" sustainable infrastructure should also set off alarms. Too often this rhetoric serves as a Trojan horse for rejecting industrial development outright under the guise of managing environmental impacts. In reality, such projects are often stymied by endless environmental review processes, activist litigations, and restrictive regulations embedded in free trade agreements.  

At its core, the UN's industrial SDG is an exercise in cynical misdirection. The real intent is not to promote sustainable economic development through scalable industrialization, but rather to spread the urban myths of environmentalism under the thin veneer of technical jargon about "sustainability" and "efficiency."

No discussion of this goal would be complete without addressing the role of innovation and technological change - which the UN rightly recognizes as critical economic drivers. However, their insistence on harnessing innovation towards environmentalist ends and reshaping it through "sustainability filters" is deeply misguided and destined to hinder the dynamism that has delivered transformative economic progress.

After all, innovation by its nature involves disruption and risk-taking. The most groundbreaking innovations, from the steam engine to the modern production model to the digital revolution, all involved challenging long-held assumptions, overcoming entrenched opposition, and finding ways to maximize scalability and reduce costs. Transformational innovations emerge organically through entrepreneurial risk-taking within free market economies - not through the heavy hand of bureaucratic planners and restrictive environmental codes.

The inconvenient truth that "sustainability" activists refuse to grapple with is that eco-purism and economic vibrancy are fundamentally incompatible. Scalable industrialization, with all its environmental impacts, was a necessary condition for the Western world to transition from ubiquitous poverty and scarcity to modern abundance. The UN now seeks to deny that transformative opportunity to the rest of the developing world under the fig leaf of sustainable development.

The world's poor shouldn't be mired in subsistence economies just to satisfy Western eco-ideologues and the UN's culture of enforced stagnation. For true economic and social progress to be sustainable, industrialization, game-changing innovations, and resilient infrastructure must be allowed to flourish with few restraints. The UN's industrial goal, couched in opaque sustainability jargon, represents precisely the opposite. It is a thinly-veiled attempt to deny modernity to the world's impoverished masses and preserve their suffering to protect the indulgent fantasies of Western elites. As such, this deeply fraught and cynical scheme cannot be allowed to succeed.
