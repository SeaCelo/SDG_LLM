Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, as if written by the economist David Autor:

The Sustainable Development Goals represent an ambitious and wide-ranging agenda to tackle the world's most pressing challenges by 2030. Of particular interest to labor economists is SDG 9, which calls for building "resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization and fostering innovation." This goal speaks to issues at the very core of my research over the last two decades: how technological change, global economic integration, and shifting labor market institutions are reshaping the demand for skills and the structure of employment across nations. 

A central paradox motivates SDG 9: innovation is a core driver of economic progress, yet it can also be an engine of labor displacement, rising inequality, and societal disruption. While the introduction of new tools, processes, and services enhances productivity and raises living standards overall, the disruptive force of innovation falls unequally. Those working in newly-automated occupations or facing import competition from low-wage nations frequently suffers dislocation and permanent earnings losses. This "insecurity multiplier" from technical and global economic forces has likely contributed to the reactionary populism roiling many advanced nations. 

A key challenge, therefore, is developing policies that stimulate innovation while mitigating its displacement costs. Among other objectives, SDG 9 calls for enhancing scientific research, upgrading technological capabilities, and increasing access to information and communications technology. But equally important are measures to "promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization," facilitate sustainable infrastructure development, and enhance access to financial services and markets. These aims knit together growth via innovation and infrastructure investment with the development of new economic opportunities, particularly for those most vulnerable to labor churning.

Inclusive growth policies do not simply redistribute the gains from innovation, however. They also engender a socioeconomic environment more conducive to innovation itself. A rising tide of automation anxiety and regressive populism is hardly fertile ground for knowledge-intensive investment. If companies, entrepreneurs and skilled workers cannot be assured of reaping the rewards from innovation, they will innovate less. Likewise, infrastructure deficits and creaking institutional capacity depress rates of return on capital investment. A dynamic, innovative economy therefore requires a comprehensive approach integrating equity and economic inclusion with measures to catalyze invention, commercialization and capital formation.

This paradigm is especially germane for developing countries seeking to modernize technologically while creating economic opportunities for rapidly urbanizing populations. Upgrading from rural agricultural subsistence to urban manufacturing and services entails a profound structural transformation analogous to the historical experiences of today's rich nations. Low-wage manufacturing served as a critical staging ground for export-led growth across the East Asian Tigers and China. These countries could capitalize on abundant low-cost labor to gain a foothold in global value chains and seed the development of industrial clusters. Their export revenue in turn funded infrastructure investment (transport, utilities, telecoms) and productive capabilities (education, technology absorption) that enabled subsequent advancement into higher value-added activities.

This conventional development trajectory is, however, increasingly under threat from labor-saving automation across a widening array of routine production activities. The precipitous decline in prices for robots, computing power, machine vision systems and associated technologies means that firms can cost-effectively automate away many routine technical and manual tasks once performed by low-skilled labor in manufacturing, logistics and office environments. Bangladesh, Vietnam, Ethiopia and other current low-wage manufacturing hubs may not have the opportunity to use export-led industrialization as an escalator out of poverty. Rather than climbing the ladder of comparative advantage, some development economists fear these countries could remain trapped in low-productivity agriculture and services due to premature deindustrialization. 

At the same time, the latest automation technologies harbinger new prospects. Though routine production work faces rising substitution risk, newly emerging capabilities in artificial intelligence, the Cloud, the Internet of Things, blockchain, and advanced robotics are massively complementary with human labor in general. Countries unshackled from legacy production structures may be able to directly build 21st century innovation ecosystems oriented around these new general purpose technologies. The key is forward-looking investment in next generation digital infrastructure, technological skill pipelines, research capabilities, and capital market reforms enabling the reallocation of resources towards emergent high-value economic activities.  

Easier porting blueprints for the next production revolution than trying to recreate the last one. But is that recipe replicable beyond the city-states and concentrated industrial clusters already adept at such economic activities? Can large nations like Nigeria, Pakistan and Brazil leverage their size advantages to cultivate digital innovation clusters of global scale? What complementary investments and reforms are required to ensure that the productivity gains from new inventions translate into broad-based income gains rather than further concentrating rents?

These questions highlight why SDG 9 is so incredibly ambitious yet also imperative. Technological ingenuity is unlocking possibilities for advancing living standards that were barely conceivable just a decade ago. But channeling these breakthroughs in the service of sustainable, inclusive development will require meticulous structural reforms and investments catalyzed by unprecedented international partnership and policy coordination. Much is at stake in the decades ahead. Nations thriving at the frontier of innovation, infrastructure and economic transformation will flourish, while those lagging or disrupted could fall further behind. Managing technological disruption while constructing an economic model capable of delivering broad-based prosperity is the imperative of our era.
