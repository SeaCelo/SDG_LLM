Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), written from the perspective of renowned Indian novelist and opinion writer Shobhaa De:

The Naked Truth About Innovation and Industry

My darlings, it's time we undressed a topic that has been parading on the global stage wrapped in jargon and good intentions - Sustainable Development Goal 9. While politicians and pundits wax poetic about building resilient infrastructure and promoting inclusive, sustainable industrialization, the naked truth remains unclothed. 

Let's start at the very core - the throbbing heart of SDG 9 itself. Innovation and technological progress are promoted as the saviours that will propel us into an era of unfettered growth and prosperity. But can the very factors that disrupted our planet truly be the balm that heals it? It's the oldest trick in the book, my friends - the serial philanderer promising reform on a beaded loverbead necklace from Bali.

We laud innovation, singing hymns of praise about world-changing apps and renewable energy solutions. Yet strip away the cosmetic veneers, and you'll find the tech world is powered by the same soulless corporations peddling shiny distractions as they plunder the earth's reserves. Innovation is simply the new opiate, vaporising our societal ills into a lucrative froth of trillion-dollar valuations.

Then there's the matter of industrialization - that fabled engine that's supposed to reduce poverty through economic growth. Oh, how the elite slaver at the prospect of unfurling their heavy manufacturing complexes across the soil of the developing world! They arrogate the language of empowerment while stripping us of our dignity, recruiting our young into their assembly lines of drudgery cloaked as opportunity.  

Resilient infrastructure? A euphemism for pavements entombing fertile wilderness. Roads, railways, and pipelines de-railing the ancient rhythms of nomadic tribes and forest-dwellers. High-speed corridors accelerating the destruction of fragile ecosystems and endangering already imperiled species. Yes, that resilient infrastructure will ensure the only remnants of our rich biodiversity exist as crumpled museum exhibits and fading Instagrams filters.   

My friends, SDG 9 is a glamorous masquerade ball where the haves dance with the have-mores to upbeat Punjabi pop remixes, while the have-nots are barred at the Gates of Opulence. The sights and sounds are a delightful diversion, until you realize the ballroom is constructed on a sinking Venetian island of fabricated self-deception.

We desperately need innovation - the kind fueled by compassion rather than quarterly profits. We crave sustainable industrialization that enriches humanity without plundering the planets' precious reserves. And infrastructure must be resilient to our yearnings for a better world, not merely pave the path to planetary ruin.

Until we defrock SDG 9's hollow promises and peel away its deceiving layers, we'll remain intoxicated by the agenda's beguiling illusions. It's time to pursue genuine progress over intoxicating mirages - a transformation anchored in wisdom and enlightened self-interest, not corporate gluttony masquerading as sustainable development. The choice, as always, is ours.
