Here is a detailed academic article about Sustainable Development Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), written from the perspective of the contrarian author and journalist Peter Hitchens:

The Folly of the Technocratic Agenda: Why SDG 9 is a Misguided Endeavor

By Peter Hitchens

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals have been widely lauded by the great and the good as an enlightened, forward-thinking blueprint to secure humanity's prosperous future. Chief among these much-vaunted objectives is SDG 9 - "Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation." Yet this hyper-ambitious scheme to restructure the foundations of global production and logistics is little more than a utopian fantasy concocted by an arrogant caste of technocrats divorced from reality.  

At its core, SDG 9 represents an extreme manifestation of the modern Western idolatry of innovation and technological progress. Its zealous advocates venerate the ideal of perpetual disruption, erroneously equating rapid change with inherent improvement. They cling to the debunked superstition of the Whig interpretation of history - that humanity is predestined to proceed along an inexorable arc towards greater enlightenment and material advancement. Yet this dogma, forged amidst the crucible of revolutionary Europe, wilfully ignores the grave perils of unchecked industrialization and rootless experimentation.    

The horrors inflicted by soulless factories and smoke-belching mills during the Industrial Revolution have been comprehensively documented. This reckless upheaval destroyed ancient communities, instigated misery and despoilment on an epic scale, and robbed millions of any connection to tradition or meaning. For all its purported benevolence, SDG 9 threatens to rekindle these fires of creative destruction, empowering a rootless global kleptocracy under the guise of "building resilient infrastructure." 

In truth, these ill-conceived policies are fundamentally hostile to resilience. Traditional settlements and social fabrics that endured across millennia are being systematically dismantled to sate the ravenous maw of metropolitan progressivism. Pristine environments and indigenous habitats face obliteration to facilitate the advancement of resource-stripping industries euphemistically marketed as "sustainable." Notions of national sovereignty and identity mean nothing to the hi-tech conglomerates and rootless oligarchs steering this globalist juggernaut.  

Even more egregious is SDG 9's fetishization of amoral innovation devoid of any grounding in righteousness or virtue. Fueled by vast concentrations of mammon, undisciplined research and development has birthed a nightmarish host of abominations - addictive digital devices corroding the minds of the young, genetic aberrations blurring the line between man and beast, autonomous weaponry designed to extinguish human life with machine efficiency. Yet the lords of Silicon Valley and their government accomplices ardently pursue such desecrations under the auspices of "inclusive and sustainable industrialization."

Those who dissent from this technocratic orthodoxy are slandered as troglodytes or luddites by the high priests of modernity. Yet it is they who exhibit the true obscurantist zeal, arrogantly dismissing wisdom hallowed by ages and upending the immutable edicts of Heaven for the sake of utopian ambition. In their spiritual blindness, they fail to grasp that genuine progress must be firmly rooted in consecrated tradition and the eternal moral verities. 

While claimingto promote sustainability, the policies advanced under SDG 9 are in fact grievously unsustainable. No fabricated system, no matter how intricately engineered, can endure for the ages when it is decoupled from the rejuvenating wellsprings of faith and ancestral culture. The path it advocates of ceaseless, unfettered transformation at the behest of unaccountable elites is a formula for social dissolution and ecological cataclysm. Legitimate reform and measured industrial development must be grounded in the eternal precepts of virtue and restraint stipulated by the divine order.

 As it stands, this agenda masquerading as a panacea for humanity's woes constitutes one of the gravest existential threats we face in the modern age. Unelected, opaque multinational bodies and their technocrat adjuncts have appointed themselves the arbiters of civilization's fate, armed with the delusional certainty that empirical knowledge and applied science alone can resolve the profound metaphysical quandaries afflicting the human condition. We would be wise to reject their profane overconfidence - and their dystopian vision of a deracinated global utopia - before it consummates itself in unprecedented cataclysm.
