The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) introduced by the United Nations in 2015 are a set of bold targets aiming to transform our world and secure a sustainable future for all. While all the 17 goals address key aspects of development, one that stands out as particularly vital in shaping our global agenda is SDG 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. In the face of unprecedented health challenges and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, SDG 3 has become more resonant than ever.

Health is not just a fundamental human right; it is a key driver of economic progress. Bloomberg Businessweek explores how SDG 3 not only emphasizes the importance of accessible and affordable healthcare for every individual but also focuses on preventing the outbreak and spread of diseases, ensuring universal health coverage, and addressing all the social determinants of health.

The COVID-19 crisis has laid bare the glaring gaps in global healthcare systems. Despite significant advances in medical science, the pandemic has reminded us that no one is safe until everyone is safe. SDG 3 highlights the need to strengthen national healthcare systems, not only in terms of infrastructure, but also by investing in a well-trained and equipped healthcare workforce capable of tackling both existing and emerging health threats.

Advancing universal health coverage (UHC) is a critical pillar of SDG 3. The goal is to provide quality and affordable healthcare services to everyone, irrespective of their socio-economic background. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the importance of robust healthcare systems that can reach and support everyone, particularly the most vulnerable populations. Countries with strong UHC systems have been able to mount effective responses to the virus, saving countless lives and mitigating the economic impact.

SDG 3 exemplifies the interconnected nature of the Sustainable Development Goals. Addressing health challenges is not just restricted to the healthcare sector but requires a multi-sectoral approach. The goal calls for policies that promote healthy living conditions, sustainable and inclusive cities, access to clean water and sanitation, as well as the promotion of mental health and well-being.

Furthermore, SDG 3 places significant emphasis on disease prevention and control. By promoting immunization programs, increasing access to affordable and essential medicines, and raising awareness about health risks and lifestyle choices, this goal seeks to reduce the burden of preventable diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, and non-communicable diseases.

To achieve SDG 3, partnership and collaboration among various stakeholders is crucial. Governments, corporations, civil society organizations, and individuals must work together to ensure that the right to health is upheld and that adequate investments are made in research, development, and innovation.

Businesses, in particular, have a unique role to play in supporting SDG 3. By prioritizing employee health and well-being, adopting sustainable practices, and engaging in philanthropic initiatives, companies can drive positive change and positively impact the health and well-being of their employees, customers, and communities.

Addressing SDG 3 not only offers an opportunity to save lives and improve the overall well-being of individuals but is also a smart economic choice. According to estimates by The World Health Organization, every dollar invested in health yields an economic return of approximately four dollars.

Amid unprecedented challenges, the Sustainable Development Goals, and particularly SDG 3, serve as a roadmap for building resilient health systems, advancing universal health coverage, and ensuring well-being for all. As we navigate through the ongoing pandemic, it is evident that investing in health is investing in a sustainable future that benefits everyone. By striving for SDG 3, we can forge a path towards a world where everyone, regardless of their circumstances, has access to the health services they need and can lead a life of dignity and prosperity.
