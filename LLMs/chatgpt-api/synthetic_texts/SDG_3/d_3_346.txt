It is with great pleasure that the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation presents this detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3): "Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages."

SDG 3 is a crucial component of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, aiming to address the global health challenges and improve overall well-being. With the primary objective of ensuring healthy lives, the goal encompasses a comprehensive range of targets to tackle major health issues and promote equity in access to healthcare services.

One of the key targets of SDG 3 is to reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births. Currently, maternal mortality remains unacceptably high in many parts of the world. To address this, the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation has focused its efforts on supporting maternal health programs in developing countries, working closely with local governments, non-governmental organizations, and healthcare professionals. By providing funding for improved healthcare infrastructure, training for healthcare workers, and the development of effective policies, we aim to reduce maternal mortality rates and ensure safe motherhood.

Another pressing target under SDG 3 is to end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce under-five mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births and neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1,000 live births. To achieve this, our agency has invested in strengthening healthcare systems at the grassroots level. We collaborate with local partners to improve maternal and child healthcare by providing essential supplies, vaccines, and optimal nutrition as well as training healthcare workers on early diagnosis and treatment of common childhood illnesses. We also prioritize the implementation of evidence-based interventions, such as immunizations, to prevent further loss of precious young lives to preventable diseases.

SDG 3 also emphasizes the importance of combating communicable diseases while addressing their risk factors, such as poor sanitation and hygiene. Our agency recognizes the critical role of disease surveillance, public health campaigns, and research in preventing and controlling pandemics and epidemics. By offering technical cooperation and capability-building initiatives, we aim to strengthen the capacities of developing countries to detect and respond to disease outbreaks, including zoonotic diseases and drug-resistant infections. Furthermore, we actively encourage partnerships between public and private sectors to drive innovative solutions that would enhance the accessibility and affordability of medicines and vaccines for those in need.

Another significant focus of SDG 3 is on universal health coverage (UHC). The goal is to ensure that everyone, regardless of their income or social status, has access to essential health services. Our agency endeavors to support developing countries in implementing equitable and sustainable UHC systems by promoting efficient resource allocation, adequate healthcare financing, and inclusive healthcare policies. We offer technical expertise in designing health financing strategies, strengthening health governance, and advocating for robust health systems.

In conclusion, the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation remains committed to achieving SDG 3 and ensuring healthy lives and well-being for all. By strategically targeting key areas such as maternal and child healthcare, communicable disease control, and universal health coverage, we strive to make a significant impact on global health outcomes. While progress has been made, there is still much work to be done. Therefore, we call on all stakeholders to join us in our efforts, enhance international collaboration, and harness the power of innovation to accelerate the journey towards a healthier and more sustainable future.
