Title: Analyzing the Socio-Economic Implications of Sustainable Development Goal 3: Ensuring Healthy lives and Promoting Well-being for all 

Abstract:
The Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3) presented by the United Nations aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. This article explores the multi-faceted aspects of SDG 3, delves into its relevance to economic dynamics, and investigates the control strategies required for achieving the targets under this goal. By employing a comprehensive and precise approach, this study provides insights into the potential socio-economic benefits of achieving SDG 3 and proposes strategic steps to address emerging challenges.

1. Introduction:
The emergence and adoption of SDG 3 marks a significant milestone in global efforts to improve healthcare systems, overall well-being, and extend life expectancy. By analyzing the interconnectedness with other Sustainable Development Goals, this article highlights the associated economic dynamics and control mechanisms required to accomplish SDG 3 successfully.

2. Analyzing the Relevance of SDG 3 with Economic Dynamics:
SDG 3 is intrinsically linked to economic dynamics, as improved health and well-being have profound impacts on human capital, productivity, and labor market outcomes. Diseases, healthcare costs and accessibility, quality of healthcare services, and social factors such as education contribute to economic inefficiencies. Therefore, achieving the targets set by SDG 3 can lead to reduced healthcare costs, increased productivity, enhanced innovation, and improved human capital development, ultimately fostering long-term economic growth.

3. Control Strategies for SDG 3:
Effective control strategies are crucial for the successful implementation and monitoring of SDG 3. This section explores the importance of government policies and regulations in promoting healthcare investment, access to medical facilities, disease prevention, and health promotion campaigns. It also emphasizes the significance of multi-stakeholder collaborations with research institutions, private sectors, and non-governmental organizations to foster scientific advancements and innovation in healthcare delivery.

4. Enhancing Healthcare Ecosystems for Sustainable Development:
Sustainable healthcare ecosystems are essential for achieving SDG 3. This section explores various aspects of healthcare ecosystem development, including the innovation of medical technologies, strengthened information systems, capacity building, and healthcare workforce development. The use of telemedicine and e-health solutions, along with the effective utilization of big data analytics, can significantly enhance healthcare service delivery and improve health outcomes.

5. Addressing Emerging Challenges:
The successful implementation of SDG 3 is confronted with numerous challenges. This section discusses some of the current issues such as universal healthcare coverage, healthcare financing, healthcare infrastructure in rural and marginalized regions, and the increasing impact of non-communicable diseases. Using examples from diverse economies, it explores best practices and potential policy interventions to address these challenges effectively.

6. The Role of Economic Incentives in Achieving SDG 3:
Economic incentives play a crucial role in fostering the attainment of SDG 3 targets. This section examines the influence of public and private funding mechanisms, investment in pharmaceutical and medical technology R&D, and public-private partnerships in ensuring cost-effective health interventions. It further explores the potential impact of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) schemes and health insurance policies in mobilizing financial resources to support the achievement of SDG 3.

7. Conclusion:
As the world stands at a critical juncture to build a healthier global population, SDG 3 offers a comprehensive framework to promote healthy lives and well-being for all. By recognizing the links between healthcare and economic dynamics, and emphasizing the significance of control strategies, this article demonstrates the potential socio-economic benefits that can be realized through the achievement of SDG 3. It is imperative for policymakers, academia, and stakeholders to collaborate and develop innovative approaches towards meeting the challenges SDG 3 imposes, fostering sustainable development and prosperity for future generations.
