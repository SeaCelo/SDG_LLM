The Sustainable Development Goal 3, established by the United Nations, aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. Specifically, it focuses on reducing child mortality, improving maternal health, combating HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases, and promoting universal healthcare coverage. As an expert analysis report drafted by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), this document explores the progress made in achieving SDG 3 and offers recommendations for future action.

Child Mortality:
With concerted global efforts, significant progress has been made to reduce child mortality rates. However, challenges persist, particularly in developing regions. Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia still account for the highest number of child deaths, primarily due to preventable causes such as pneumonia, diarrhea, and malaria. In order to sustain the momentum achieved so far, interventions targeting nutrition, vaccination, and improving access to quality healthcare services need to be intensified. Countries must prioritize strengthening health systems, training healthcare providers, and promoting integrated approaches for child health.

Maternal Health:
Improving maternal health remains a key challenge in achieving SDG 3. Maternal deaths, especially in low-income countries, continue to plague communities and hinder progress towards universal well-being. In Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, high maternal mortality ratios persist due to limited access to quality reproductive healthcare services, cultural barriers, and inadequate infrastructure. To address these issues, it is crucial to invest in primary healthcare infrastructure, community-based health services, strengthening midwifery skills, and promoting comprehensive sexual and reproductive health education.

Combatting HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and Other Diseases:
While progress has been made in combating HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases, the persistence of these epidemics calls for intensified efforts. Sub-Saharan Africa remains the most affected region, with disproportionately high disease burden. Achieving SDG 3 requires sustained investment in prevention and treatment measures, including access to affordable antiretroviral therapy, long-lasting insecticidal nets, and increased diagnostic capacities. Enhancing partnerships between governments, development agencies, and communities is crucial in combating these diseases effectively.

Universal Health Coverage:
Universal health coverage (UHC) acts as a foundational element in achieving SDG 3 as it ensures equitable access to quality healthcare services without financial hardship. Nevertheless, significant gaps exist in healthcare coverage, particularly in low-income countries. Challenges such as the lack of financial resources, weak health systems, and inequitable distribution of services hinder progress towards UHC. To expedite progress, adequate investment in health systems strengthening, building on initiatives like the Primary Health Care approach, is essential. Additionally, innovative financing mechanisms, community-based insurance programs, and efficient use of digital technologies can play pivotal roles in expanding healthcare access.

Conclusion:
Although progress has been made in the attainment of SDG 3 targets, much work is still needed to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all. To accelerate progress, it is essential for governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector to strengthen collaborative efforts, uphold human rights-based approaches, and prioritize investments in healthcare infrastructures, empowerment, and prevention strategies. By working together, we can address the existing challenges and make significant strides towards achieving SDG 3 and improving the overall health and well-being of people worldwide.
