Behavioral economics and the Sustainable Development Goal 10: Reducing inequality within and among countries
By Richard H. Thaler

Introduction:

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted by the United Nations in 2015 as a transformative agenda to address global challenges, including poverty, inequality, and climate change. Among these goals, SDG 10 emphasizes the crucial need to reduce inequality both within and among countries. As an economist specializing in behavioral economics, I aim to shed light on the relevance of this goal and provide insights into the ways in which behavioral economics can contribute towards its achievement.

Understanding Inequality:

Before delving into the role of behavioral economics, it is essential to understand the nature and consequences of inequality. Inequality can manifest in various forms including income, wealth, education, healthcare access, and opportunity disparities, among others. Apart from the moral imperative of reducing inequality, it is also recognized that high levels of inequality can hinder economic growth, undermine social cohesion, and intensify various social and health problems.

Behavioral Economics and Inequality:

Traditional economic models assuming rational decision-making fail to fully account for the behavioral biases and cognitive limitations that individuals face in decision-making processes. Behavioral economics, on the other hand, incorporates insights from psychology and other social sciences to explain the decision-making processes and behavior of individuals more accurately.

In the context of inequality, behavioral economics highlights the various psychological factors that contribute to its persistence. For example, people exhibit an inherent aversion to inequality, favoring fairness and equity. However, this preference for fairness can be influenced by cognitive biases such as the 'outgroup bias' where people exhibit a tendency to favor their own social group at the expense of outgroups. This bias can perpetuate intergroup inequality, widening the gap between privileged and disadvantaged individuals or communities.

Additionally, behavioral economics emphasizes the concept of 'loss aversion' which suggests that individuals tend to place a higher value on avoiding losses than acquiring gains. Since low-income individuals have relatively fewer resources and lack a safety net, they tend to fear loss more intensely. This leads them to make suboptimal decisions, including avoiding risky but potentially beneficial opportunities, thereby widening inequality.

Behavioral Economics Interventions:

To address inequality effectively, behavioral economics provides insights into designing interventions that can mitigate the cognitive biases and behavioral barriers that perpetuate inequality. These interventions aim to nudge individuals towards making choices that promote equality and diminish the impact of intrinsic biases.

Nudges can take various forms such as the use of default options or simplifying complex decision-making processes. For instance, policymakers can design retirement savings schemes with automatic enrollment and default contribution rates, encouraging individuals to save for their retirement. This approach subtly alters the decision-making process by nudging individuals towards choices that are in their best long-term interest.

Moreover, behavioral insights can guide the design of public policies aimed at reducing inequality. By understanding the psychological mechanisms driving inequality, policymakers can implement more effective social and economic policies. For instance, ensuring that government benefits programs are easy to access and providing transparent information about assistance options can increase the uptake of such programs and reduce inequality.

Conclusion:

In summary, SDG 10 highlights the importance of reducing inequality within and among countries. Behavioral economics, by providing insights into human decision-making processes and biases, can play a vital role in achieving this goal. By incorporating behavioral insights into the design of interventions and public policies, we can mitigate the cognitive biases that perpetuate inequality and promote a fairer and more equal society. This field of research offers considerable scope for innovation and collaboration between economists, psychologists, policymakers, and practitioners to advance the implementation of the SDG 10 agenda and strive towards a more equitable world.
