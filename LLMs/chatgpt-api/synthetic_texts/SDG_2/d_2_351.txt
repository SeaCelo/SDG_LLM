Introduction
Thailand International Cooperation Agency (TICA) is pleased to present this analytical report on SDG 2: Zero Hunger. As an expert audience, we aim to provide a detailed overview of the current status, challenges, and opportunities related to achieving this goal in our partnerships worldwide. Our analysis will encompass critical aspects such as policy frameworks, implementation strategies, and cross-cutting issues, backed by examples from our collaborative efforts in Thailand and beyond.

1. Domestic performance
1.1. Policy and legislation
Thailand has made significant strides in aligning its policies and legislative frameworks with SDG 2. Key strategies include the National Food Act, which emphasizes the right to food security, and the Sustainable Agricultural Development Strategy that emphasizes environmentally friendly and resilient practices. Our nation has demonstrated exemplary commitment to achieve Zero Hunger domestically.

1.2. Promoting sustainable agriculture
Thailand has implemented several initiatives to enhance sustainable agriculture, such as the sufficiency economy philosophy, organic farming promotion, and agroecology practices. These efforts have bolstered small-scale farmers' productivity and resilience while reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with conventional farming.

1.3. Reducing food waste and promoting food safety
Thailand has implemented programs to reduce food losses and waste at various stages of the supply chain. Another significant focus is enhancing food safety standards and certification systems, ensuring consumer protection while promoting trade facilitation.

2. International collaborations and TICA's engagement
2.1. South-South cooperation
Thailand actively participates in South-South cooperation, sharing knowledge and expertise in agricultural technology transfer and development strategies. For example, our collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) supports capacity-building projects in neighboring countries to improve food security, agricultural practices, and trade in the region.

2.2. Triangular cooperation
TICA, in partnership with international organizations like the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), has facilitated trilateral initiatives in areas such as sustainable agriculture, post-harvest losses reduction, and enhancing market linkages. These collaborations have effectively addressed unique challenges faced by different countries and fostered mutual learning.

2.3. Partnerships with donor countries
TICA actively engages with donor countries to leverage their expertise, resources, and technical assistance to support sustainable agriculture and food security in developing countries. Through targeted collaborations, we have successfully implemented projects that enhance small-scale farmers' capacities, improve nutrition, promote gender equality, and support resilient livelihoods.

3. Challenges & Opportunities
3.1. Climate change impacts
The increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events threaten food security globally. TICA recognizes the need for climate-smart agriculture practices, resilience building, and investment in technologies that mitigate climate-related risks. Scaling up climate change adaptation initiatives offers a significant opportunity for collaboration within the framework of SDG 2.

3.2. Addressing hunger in conflict-affected areas
Prolonged conflicts challenge efforts to achieve Zero Hunger. TICA advocates for prioritizing conflict resolution and peacebuilding, emphasizing the importance of resilient food systems in war-torn regions. Collaboration with international partners is crucial in addressing the complex needs of these areas.

3.3. Harnessing digital solutions
Digitalization offers immense potential in enhancing agricultural productivity, supply chain management, and market access. TICA strives to harness digital solutions and promote innovation to accelerate progress towards Zero Hunger, including the adoption of precision technologies, blockchain, and data analytics to enhance efficiency.

Conclusion
TICA's commitment to SDG 2: Zero Hunger is reflected in our domestic policies and collaborations worldwide. By integrating sustainable agriculture, addressing food waste, and promoting food safety, Thailand has made significant progress toward achieving the goal. Our collaborative efforts within South-South and triangular cooperation, as well as partnerships with donor countries, have leveraged resources, knowledge, and technology transfer to support sustainable food systems globally. Challenges related to climate change and conflicts underscore the importance of international collaboration, while digital solutions pave the way for innovation and efficiency gains. Moving forward, TICA remains dedicated to addressing the remaining gaps and contributing further towards Zero Hunger worldwide.
