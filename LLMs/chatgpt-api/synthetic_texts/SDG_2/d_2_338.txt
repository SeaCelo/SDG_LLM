Assessment of SDG 2: Zero Hunger

Executive Summary

This analytical report aims to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the status quo of Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2): Zero Hunger. As part of our commitment to achieving this goal, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Development Co-operation Department has taken a thorough approach in scrutinizing the progress made, challenges faced, and potential strategies to effectively combat hunger and achieve food security. The report is designed for an audience of experts in the field, including policymakers, international organizations, NGOs, and researchers.

Introduction

SDG 2 encompasses a broad mandate to eradicate hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030. It recognizes the interconnectedness of these elements and acknowledges that to achieve zero hunger, we must address root causes such as poverty, climate change, inequality, and the inefficient allocation of resources. This goal aligns with the principles of equity, participation, and resilience, as well as the vision of globally inclusive and sustainable development.

Progress made

Despite persistent challenges, significant progress has been made towards SDG 2. According to recent data, the number of undernourished individuals declined from 809 million in 2017 to 690 million in 2019, representing a reduction of nearly 15% in just two years. Additionally, considerable advancements have been made in various regions, particularly in East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Latin America. The uptake of agricultural technologies, sustainable farming practices, and targeted policies has proven effective in combating hunger. Increased awareness and interventions targeting malnutrition have led to the reduction of stunting and wasting among children under five years old, demonstrating some noteworthy success.

Challenges and Obstacles

Despite these progressions, numerous challenges continue to impede the achievement of SDG 2. Firstly, conflicts and political instability disrupt food production, trade, and distribution. In regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East, conflicts have resulted in large-scale displacement and reduced access to food, exacerbating hunger crises. Secondly, climate change-induced extreme weather events such as droughts, floods, and heat waves pose a significant threat to agriculture, leading to lower crop yields, livelihood loss, and increased food insecurity. These environmental challenges are further exacerbated by inadequate infrastructure and weak resource management systems in vulnerable countries. Thirdly, persistent poverty and inequality perpetuate hunger by limiting access to food, resources, and education, exacerbating marginalization and disparities.

Strategic Recommendations

To effectively address the complex challenges inhibiting progress towards SDG 2, a multi-faceted approach blending traditional and innovative strategies is crucial. Some key recommendations are as follows:

1. Enhancing agricultural productivity: Promote sustainable intensification of agriculture by adopting improved technologies, enhancing water management systems, and promoting climate-smart practices. Scaling-up investment in agricultural research and extension services will optimize productivity gains and promote food security.

2. Strengthening resilience: Invest in disaster risk reduction and build climate resilience within agrarian communities. Implement early warning systems, support the adoption of drought and flood-resistant crop varieties, promote sustainable natural resource management, and integrate climate considerations into national agricultural policies and practices.

3. Nutrition-sensitive interventions: Prioritize evidence-based interventions that tackle all forms of malnutrition, including wasting, stunting, and micronutrient deficiencies. Integrate nutrition into agricultural and rural development programs and focus on promoting breastfeeding, dietary diversification, and fortification of essential nutrients.

4. Invigorating rural development: Encourage comprehensive and inclusive rural development programs that promote value-chain development, enhance access to credit and markets, and provide entrepreneurial opportunities. Strengthen land tenure rights, empower women and youth in agriculture, and promote sustainable and inclusive economic growth in rural areas.

Conclusion

SDG 2 underscores the urgency and importance of achieving zero hunger on a global scale by 2030. While significant progress has been achieved, numerous challenges persist, underscoring the need for targeted, evidence-based, and multi-faceted strategies. By bolstering agricultural productivity, enhancing resilience, prioritizing nutrition-sensitive interventions, and invigorating rural development, we can make tangible progress towards Zero Hunger. As stakeholders, it is essential to collaborate, align resources, and facilitate the necessary political will to achieve this core sustainable development goal and uphold our commitments to the elimination of hunger and the fundamental right to food for all.
