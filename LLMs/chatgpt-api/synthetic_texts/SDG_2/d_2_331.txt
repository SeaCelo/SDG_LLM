Introduction

This analytical report aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of the progress made toward achieving Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) which pertains to ending hunger, achieving food security and improved nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture. As a leading development agency, the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development has been at the forefront of efforts to promote sustainable development, particularly in the Arab region. This report caters to an expert audience and highlights the current status, challenges, and recommendations related to SDG 2.

Current Status

Despite notable progress, global hunger and malnutrition remain significant challenges. Analysis shows that the prevalence of undernourishment has increased to 9.2% in 2018, affecting around 690 million people. Moreover, economic disparities between countries and regions continue to impede efforts to ensure food security for all.

In the Arab region, progress toward SDG 2 varies among countries. Access to sufficient and nutritious food has improved over the past decades, but the region still faces multiple obstacles. Conflicts, political instability, climate change impacts, and water scarcity are major hindrances to achieving sustainable agriculture and food security.

Challenges

1. Conflict and Political Instability: Ongoing conflicts and political instability negatively impact food systems, agricultural production, and access to nutritious food. Displacement and disruption of farming activities significantly affect food security in conflict-affected areas.

2. Climate Change and Natural Disasters: The Arab region is susceptible to the adverse effects of climate change, including rising temperatures, droughts, and desertification. These climate-related challenges threaten agricultural productivity, food availability, and overall food security.

3. Water Scarcity and Unsustainable Water Management: Many countries in the Arab region suffer from limited freshwater availability and unsustainable water management practices. Water scarcity severely limits agricultural production and raises concerns over long-term food security.

4. Underinvestment in Agriculture: Insufficient investment in agriculture, research, and development limits the potential for increasing productivity, improving rural livelihoods, and ensuring sustainable agricultural practices. Financial support is crucial to uplift the agricultural sector's capacity and resilience.

Recommendations

1. Conflict Resolution and Stability: A priority should be placed on resolving conflicts, promoting peace, and ensuring political stability, as these factors are vital for ensuring food security. Strengthening governance mechanisms in conflict-affected areas and investing in programs that target vulnerable populations will enhance agriculture productivity.

2. Climate Resilience and Adaptation: Regional cooperation is required to address climate change challenges. Enhancing adaptive capacity, integrating climate-friendly practices into agriculture, and investing in climate-resilient crops will bolster agricultural resilience and food security.

3. Efficient Water Management: Countries should adopt holistic approaches to improve water management practices. Promoting efficient irrigation methods, water-saving technologies, and investing in water infrastructure will help mitigate water scarcity impacts on agriculture.

4. Increase Investment in Agriculture: Greater investment in research and development, agri-businesses, and rural infrastructure will strengthen the agricultural sector's productivity and support sustainable farming practices. Collaboration between private and public sectors can unlock innovative solutions for agricultural advancement.

Conclusion

Efforts to achieve SDG 2 are crucial to eradicate hunger, ensure food security, and promote sustainable agriculture in the Arab region. This analytical report highlights the current status, challenges, and recommendations related to SDG 2. By addressing conflicts, climate change impacts, water scarcity, and the need for increased investment, stakeholders can pave the way for a food-secure and sustainable future. The Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development remains committed to supporting initiatives that contribute to the achievement of SDG 2 and foster sustainable development across the Arab region.
