Introduction
This analytical report aims to comprehensively examine the progress and challenges related to the implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) – ending hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture. Targeting an expert audience, this report highlights the specific contexts of least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs), which face unique and exacerbated challenges in attaining SDG 2.

Progress Assessment
Significant progress has been made globally towards realizing SDG 2 since its adoption in 2015. However, the COVID-19 pandemic and other ongoing crises have jeopardized these gains, especially in the aforementioned countries which already face an uphill battle. LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs experience the highest prevalence of undernourishment, poverty, and limited access to resources such as land, water, and technology – making it crucial to review their specific situations and progress.

Food Security and Hunger
In LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs, food security remains a major challenge due to limited productive resources and adverse climate conditions. Rapid population growth, unsustainable agricultural practices, and rural-urban migration further strain already compromised food systems. These countries struggle to achieve an adequate and nutritious diet for their populations, resulting in undernourishment, malnutrition, stunted growth, and health issues, particularly among children and vulnerable groups.

Improving Nutrition
While progress has been made to reduce malnutrition globally, LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs still grapple with the multiple burdens of undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, and the rising prevalence of overweight and obesity. Insufficient access to diverse and nutritious foods plagues these countries, exacerbated by limited local agricultural production, weak value chains, inadequate market infrastructure, and weak governance of food safety and quality regulations. Additionally, lack of awareness and education on balanced diets contribute to the persistence of malnutrition.

Sustainable Agriculture Practices
Agriculture is backbone of the economies in LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs, with many smallholder farmers relying heavily on it for livelihoods. Raising agricultural productivity sustainably and adapting to climate change is crucial to achieving SDG 2. Limited access to credit, low investment in agricultural research and development, inability to adopt climate-smart techniques, and poor infrastructure hinder the advancement of sustainable agriculture. Furthermore, natural disasters, water scarcity, soil degradation, and pest outbreaks pose formidable challenges to these countries' agricultural systems.

Support and Partnerships
SDG 2 cannot be achieved in isolation, particularly in countries facing severe constraints. International support and partnerships play a vital role in addressing the unique challenges faced by LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs. Collaborative efforts are needed to enhance domestic resource mobilization, build smallholder farmers' capacities, improve access to finance and technologies, implement climate resilience strategies, and foster inclusive governance and policy frameworks. Ensure the Least Developed Countries Fund, the Climate Adaptation Fund, and the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program are adequately resourced.

Conclusion
In conclusion, SDG 2 is an essential goal with profound significance for all countries, especially for LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs. Recognizing the specific challenges faced by these countries is of utmost importance to optimize the impact of interventions and improve the lives of millions. This analysis underscores the urgent need for tailored strategies and international cooperation to address the complex interlinkages of hunger, malnutrition, and sustainable agriculture in vulnerable countries, and outlines specific policy recommendations and areas of support that will be crucial for progress towards SDG 2. Partnering effectively with governments, civil society, private sector, and international bodies will be central to achieving transformational change in the pursuit of a hunger-free and sustainable world.
