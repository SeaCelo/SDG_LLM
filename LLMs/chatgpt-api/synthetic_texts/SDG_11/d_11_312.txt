Analytical Report

Agência Brasileira de Cooperação (ABC)

Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the progress made towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 11, focused on sustainable cities and communities. The report analyzes the current situation in Brazil and highlights key challenges, successes, and recommendations for achieving this goal. The analysis serves as a guide for policymakers, planners, and stakeholders involved in urban planning and development to foster sustainable and inclusive cities in Brazil.

1. Introduction

Sustainable Development Goal 11 aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable by 2030. In Brazil, rapid urbanization has led to several challenges, including inadequate housing, limited access to basic services, and increasing environmental degradation. The goal seeks to address these challenges and ensure that cities are designed to optimize economic, social, and environmental benefits for all residents.

2. Current Situation in Brazil

Brazil has made commendable progress towards achieving SDG 11. The implementation of programs and initiatives such as the Minha Casa, Minha Vida (My House, My Life) program and the Estatuto da Cidade (City Statute) has contributed to enhancing access to adequate and affordable housing and improving urban planning.

However, despite these efforts, challenges persist. Rapid urbanization has led to the proliferation of informal settlements, lacking necessary infrastructure, jeopardizing the well-being of residents. Additionally, the lack of investment in public transportation has resulted in increased traffic congestion and air pollution in major cities, negatively impacting residents' health and well-being.

3. Key Challenges

a) Informal settlements: The prevalence of informal settlements remains a key challenge. These settlements often lack basic infrastructure, such as potable water, sanitation systems, and regular access to healthcare and education services.

b) Inadequate transportation: Limited investment in public transportation infrastructure exacerbates traffic congestion and air pollution in urban centers. The lack of affordable, efficient, and sustainable transportation options negatively impacts the accessibility, inclusion, and well-being of urban residents.

c) Environmental degradation: Urbanization has put significant pressure on natural resources, resulting in environmental degradation and the loss of green spaces. This degradation has adverse effects on the resilience and sustainability of cities and contributes to climate change.

4. Successes and Best Practices

a) Minha Casa, Minha Vida Program: The Minha Casa, Minha Vida program has played a crucial role in increasing access to affordable housing for low-income populations. By prioritizing inclusive housing as a top priority, the program has made significant strides in reducing housing inequalities.

b) Estatuto da Cidade: The implementation of the City Statute has helped strengthen urban planning and land-use regulations, enabling cities to effectively manage spatial growth and promote social equity and inclusivity.

c) Integrated Urban Development: Several cities in Brazil have embraced an integrated approach to urban development, encouraging multi-stakeholder collaborations, fostering participatory decision-making, and promoting sustainable development practices. These cities have demonstrated the potential for inclusive and sustainable urban models.

5. Recommendations

a) Slum Upgrading: Focus on slum upgrading initiatives by investing in basic infrastructure, such as water and sanitation systems, electricity, healthcare centers, and schools, ensuring residents have equal access to essential services.

b) Sustainable Transportation: Prioritize investments in sustainable modes of transportation, such as public transit, cycling infrastructure, and walkable streets. Encourage the use of electric and hybrid vehicles, enhancing air quality and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

c) Urban Greening: Transform urban landscapes by enhancing and expanding green spaces. Create public parks and gardens, promote rooftop gardens, and integrate nature-based solutions into urban planning to foster environmental conservation.

d) Data-driven Approach: Adopt a data-driven approach to urban planning and policy-making. Utilize technologies and data analytics to assess the environmental impact of urbanization, monitor progress, and identify areas for intervention.

6. Conclusion

To achieve Sustainable Development Goal 11, Brazil must transform its cities and communities into inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable spaces. By addressing challenges, capitalizing on successes, and implementing the outlined recommendations, Brazil can make significant progress towards creating cities that enhance the quality of life for all residents, foster social inclusion, and protect the environment. Agência Brasileira de Cooperação remains committed to supporting Brazil in its journey towards realizing the aspirations of Sustainable Development Goal 11.
