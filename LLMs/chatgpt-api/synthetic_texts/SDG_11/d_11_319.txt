INTRODUCTION

This report aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11) targeted towards an expert audience. SDG 11, titled "Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable", is one of the seventeen Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the United Nations in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This goal focuses on transforming urban areas to ensure they are equitable, resilient, and sustainable, addressing the challenges cities face in terms of urbanization, traffic congestion, pollution, inadequate housing, and slum proliferation.

CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES

Rapid urbanization is a global trend, with more than half of the world's population currently residing in cities. By 2050, it is projected that urban dwellers will constitute around 68% of the world's population. In this context, it is imperative to address the challenges and opportunities associated with urban areas. SDG 11 sets out specific targets to create sustainable cities that provide equal opportunities for all, reduce the adverse environmental impacts of urbanization, and foster safe and resilient community spaces.

KEY TARGETS OF SDG 11

1. By 2030, ensure access for all to adequate, safe, and affordable housing and basic services and upgrade slums.
2. By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible, and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety. 
3. By 2030, enhance inclusive and sustainable urbanization and capacity for participatory, integrated, and sustainable human settlement planning and management.
4. Strengthen efforts to protect and safeguard the world's cultural and natural heritage.
5. By 2030, significantly reduce the number of deaths and the number of people affected and substantially decrease the direct economic losses relative to GDP caused by disasters.
6. By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and waste management.
7. Provide universal access to safe, inclusive, and accessible, green, and public spaces, particularly for women and children, older persons, and persons with disabilities.

IMPLEMENTATION & PROGRESS

The implementation of SDG 11 requires multi-sectoral collaborations involving governments, local authorities, civil society organizations, and private sector entities. As of now, substantial progress has been achieved regarding various aspects of this goal.

On the access to adequate housing and basic services, efforts have been made to enhance affordability, improve access to housing finance, and upgrade slum areas. Several countries have demonstrated commitment by adopting policies to address homelessness, improve housing conditions, and provide secure tenure for urban populations. Noteworthy initiatives, such as Mexico's "New Urban Agenda" and India's "Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana", have witnessed tangible progress in this regard.

Regarding sustainable transport systems, several cities across the globe have undertaken comprehensive mobility plans, emphasizing public transportation, integration of non-motorized modes, and promotion of sustainable urban mobility. Initiatives such as Germany's "Green City" program, often involving innovative approaches like shared mobility and e-mobility solutions, showcase significant progress in creating sustainable transport systems.

Inclusive and sustainable urbanization demands participatory planning and management approaches. Local governments, civil society organizations, and communities are increasingly engaging in urban planning, ensuring inclusivity and socio-economic diversity. Countries like Brazil, through programs like "Minha Casa Miho Vida," have demonstrated successful partnerships between government, private developers, and local communities to create sustainable urban spaces.

The protection of cultural and natural heritage is vital for sustainable cities. The UNESCO World Heritage Convention plays a crucial role in safeguarding these assets, while the "Historic Urban Landscape" approach is gaining recognition in managing urban heritage in a holistic manner. Examples like the preservation efforts for ancient cities such as Babylon in Iraq or Hoi An in Vietnam demonstrate successful heritage conservation practices with involvement from diverse stakeholders.

Ensuring safe and resilient cities presumes effective disaster management and risk reduction strategies. Disaster risk reduction efforts, such as early warning systems, resilient infrastructure planning, and community-based preparedness programs, have proven instrumental in reducing vulnerability to various hazards. Japan's earthquake-resistant building standards and Chile's proactive disaster risk assessment are exemplary approaches that have saved lives and reduced economic losses in the face of recurrent hazards.

Moving towards sustainable urban environments requires a strong focus on environmental sustainability and waste management. Promoting renewable energy, improving air quality monitoring systems, and implementing circular economy principles form vital elements of this objective. The inclusion of urban environmental indicators within city-level sustainability frameworks, like Sweden's "City of Stockholm Environmental Program," exemplifies effective environmental management practices.

Lastly, creating safe and accessible public spaces is integral to building inclusive cities. Gender-responsive urban planning, safe walking and cycling infrastructure, and age-friendly spaces are essential for promoting community cohesion and well-being. Notable inclusive spaces initiatives, such as Melbourne's "Central City Built Form Review" and Barcelona's "Superblocks" project, illustrate innovative approaches to create inclusive urban spaces that cater to diverse user needs.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, SDG 11 outlines a comprehensive agenda for transforming cities and human settlements into sustainable, safe, and inclusive spaces. Progress has been achieved across various areas, including affordable housing, sustainable transport, inclusive planning, cultural heritage preservation, disaster risk reduction, environmental sustainability, and the creation of inclusive public spaces. Continuous efforts are required to drive implementation, especially in countries facing rapid urban growth challenges. Engaging diverse stakeholders, such as local communities, private entities, and civil society organizations, is crucial for achieving the ambitious targets set under SDG 11. By pursuing the vision of sustainable cities, we can build a better future for generations to come.
