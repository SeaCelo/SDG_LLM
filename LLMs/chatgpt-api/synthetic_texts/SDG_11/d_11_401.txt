Introduction

This report provides an in-depth analysis of Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11) and its progress towards making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. As an organization committed to girls' education and empowerment, Camfed has a unique perspective on the potential impact of SDG 11 in ensuring equitable urban development for all.

Background

SDG 11 aims to enhance the quality of urban life by addressing challenges associated with rapid urbanization, such as inadequate housing, poor basic services, and environmental degradation. It recognizes that sustainable cities are crucial engines of economic growth and social development, and emphasizes the importance of access to affordable housing, safe and inclusive public spaces, and sustainable transport systems.

Achievements

Since its inception, SDG 11 has witnessed commendable achievements and significant progress in advancing urban sustainability. Many countries have adopted plans and policies aligned with SDG 11, with numerous cities implementing innovative solutions to improve conditions for their inhabitants.

One notable achievement is the improvement in global slum prevalence. As of 2018, an estimated 23.5% of the urban population lived in slums, compared to 29.7% in 2000. This downward trend can be attributed to policy interventions focusing on slum upgrading and the provision of affordable housing.

Another positive development is the increased recognition of the importance of inclusive, safe, and sustainable public spaces. Many cities are investing in the creation of parks, recreational areas, and cultural spaces accessible to all, promoting social cohesion and community well-being.

Furthermore, efforts to reduce the environmental impact of cities have gained traction. Many municipalities are implementing sustainable urban planning strategies that prioritize energy efficiency, waste management, and pollution control. This reflects a growing realization of the need to mitigate the ecological footprint of urbanization.

Challenges and Gaps

Despite these achievements, significant challenges and gaps remain in achieving the targets set by SDG 11.

One major challenge is the escalating urban poverty rate, particularly in developing countries. Rapid urbanization often leads to income inequality, insufficient housing options, and insufficient access to basic services. Addressing these inequalities and ensuring inclusive growth require targeted interventions that prioritize the needs of vulnerable communities, including girls and women.

Another critical issue is the lack of affordable housing solutions. Many cities are facing a housing crisis due to rising property prices and a shortage of affordable options. Achieving sustainable urban development necessitates the construction of affordable and resilient housing, with a focus on providing secure and dignified homes for all.

Additionally, unsafe and inadequate transport systems pose a pressing challenge. Insufficient public transportation options and reliance on private vehicles contribute to congestion, air pollution, and limited mobility, exacerbating urban environmental and health problems. Promoting sustainable and affordable transport alternatives, such as improving public transportation networks and enhancing non-motorized transport infrastructure, is crucial.

A gender perspective is also vital in achieving SDG 11. Women, and particularly girls, often face greater obstacles in accessing safe and inclusive urban spaces, essential services, and economic opportunities. It is crucial to address gender-based disparities and ensure that urban planning processes consider the specific needs and vulnerabilities of girls and women.

Conclusion

In conclusion, SDG 11 represents a significant global commitment towards achieving sustainable, inclusive, safe, and resilient cities and human settlements. While progress has been made, several challenges and gaps persist, including urban poverty, lack of affordable housing, inadequate transport systems, and gender disparities. Efforts to implement innovative policies, foster participatory planning processes, and engage diverse stakeholders are needed to overcome these obstacles. As Camfed continues to advocate for girls' education and empowerment, we remain committed to supporting SDG 11's objectives and contributing to the realization of sustainable cities for all.
