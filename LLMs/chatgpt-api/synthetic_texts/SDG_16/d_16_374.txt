The Bank supports projects and initiatives aimed at conflict prevention, peacebuilding, and social cohesion to contribute to this goal.

2. Access to Justice for All:
Another essential pillar of SDG 16 is ensuring access to justice for all. This includes promoting legal empowerment, reducing inequalities in legal representation, and providing equal access to justice mechanisms regardless of socio-economic status or gender. IsDB supports member countries in strengthening their legal frameworks and justice systems, ensuring equal rights and opportunities for all people, particularly the marginalized and vulnerable communities.

3. Effective, Accountable, and Inclusive Institutions:
The development and functioning of effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions are fundamental elements for achieving sustainable development outcomes.
