Title: The Role of Accounting in Supporting Decent Work and Economic Growth: A Critical Analysis of Sustainable Development Goal 8

Abstract:
Sustainable Development Goal 8 (SDG 8), which aims at promoting sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all, is of paramount importance in the context of global development. This article critically examines the role of accounting in advancing the targets outlined by SDG 8. By aligning economic growth with social development, SDG 8 presents numerous challenges and opportunities for the accounting profession. We explore the key issues related to measuring, reporting, and analyzing progress towards achieving SDG 8, as well as the implications for practitioners, policymakers, and researchers.

1. Introduction:
The connection between sustainable economic growth, employment, and decent work is well recognized as a prerequisite for poverty reduction and social well-being. GPd Agenda 2030 emphasizes the close relationship between economic and sustainable development aspirations. In this context, SDG 8 stands out as a central mechanism to support sustainable development by shaping policies and practices towards productive employment and decent work.

2. The Nexus Between Accounting and SDG 8:
Accounting systems play an instrumental role in tracking economic growth, assessing employment dynamics, and informing policies to promote decent work. Figures produced by national accounting systems, such as GDP and labor market indicators, are indispensable tools for benchmarking global development. Furthermore, accounting systems allow for an analysis of the distributional consequences of economic growth and the corresponding - or often disregarded - impact on employment conditions and worker well-being.

3. Measuring and Reporting Progress in Achieving SDG 8:
While accounting frameworks have long focused on financial performance, measuring social and environmental impacts has gained increasing traction in recent years. The adoption of integrated reporting and sustainability accounting enables companies to disclose non-financial indicators crucial to advancing SDG 8. This article delves into the challenges of standardizing qualitative indicators associated with decent work, employment conditions, and inclusivity. Furthermore, it explores potential methodologies, sector-specific key performance indicators, and reporting tools for assessing progress towards SDG 8.

4. Accounting's Role in Promoting Decent Work:
Beyond tracking progress, accounting has a crucial role in steering organizational behavior and promoting practices that create decent work environments. The article explores various mechanisms, including compensation and incentive structures, labor rights assessment frameworks, and board-level oversight integrating social and environmental issues. These disruptions can catalyze corporate strategies aimed at providing decent work opportunities, reducing inequality, safeguarding occupational health, and cultivating an inclusive work culture.

5. Accountability and Governance Implications:
To facilitate the transition towards SDG 8, policymakers should consider accounting standards from a governance perspective. Empowering stakeholders through accessible, reliable, and comparable information is a significant part of ensuring transparency and enhancing accountability for organizations. This article examines initiatives such as mandatory sustainability reporting regulations, stakeholder engagement in upon, and the role of public sector accounting to promote transparency and gauge the commitment of entities to sustainable and inclusive economic growth.

6. Conclusion:
As the world strives for inclusive and sustainable economic growth, the role of accounting becomes increasingly pivotal in addressing the objectives outlined in SDG 8. From measuring and reporting progress to promoting decent work and driving corporate actions, accounting offers indispensable knowledge and guidance. Effective utilization of accounting practices can facilitate informed decision-making, enhance social responsibility, and track progress towards the targets of SDG 8. This article aims to inspire further research and strive for actionable recommendations that address implementation challenges and opportunities of SDG 8.
