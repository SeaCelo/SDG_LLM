1. Introduction

The Camões Instituto da Cooperação e da Língua is pleased to present this detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. As an expert audience, we understand the complexities and underlying challenges associated with this goal. Therefore, this report aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of the current status and key considerations for achieving SDG 7.

2. The Importance of SDG 7

Access to affordable and sustainable energy is undisputedly essential for economic growth, poverty eradication, and human well-being. SDG 7 recognizes this fact and sets out ambitious targets and indicators to ensure that all people have access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services by 2030.

3. Tracking Progress 

To gauge progress towards SDG 7, several indicators have been identified. The report assesses the most relevant of these indicators, which include the proportion of the population with access to electricity, the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix, and energy efficiency measures. It is crucial to critically analyze the pace of progress in each of these areas and identify areas where further action is needed.

4. Achievements and Challenges 

Significant progress has been made toward SDG 7 since its inception. The proportion of the global population with access to electricity has increased steadily over the past decade, bringing electricity to millions of previously unserved communities. Concurrently, the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix has witnessed a progressive increase due to supportive policies, technological advancements, and conducive investment climates.

However, substantial challenges remain. Despite progress in extending access to electricity, around 759 million people globally still lack electricity, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Achieving universal access will require accelerated efforts, with a specific focus on marginalized and vulnerable communities.

Moreover, while renewable energy has made substantial inroads, it still represents only a fraction of the overall energy mix. Fossil fuels continue to dominate, posing a dual challenge to both climate change mitigation and energy affordability. Transitioning to a more sustainable and cleaner energy system necessitates a comprehensive and holistic approach, encompassing renewable energy investments, increased energy efficiency, and implementation of appropriate policy and regulatory frameworks.

5. Policy Recommendations

To move from current achievements to meeting the targets envisaged by SDG 7, strategic interventions are required. The report recommends several key actions:

- Comprehensive national energy strategies: Countries should adopt long-term energy strategies that integrate various sources of energy, prioritize renewable energy development, and define clear policies and regulations on energy efficiency.

- Investment in renewable energy: Governments and international financial institutions should mobilize adequate funds to promote renewable energy projects, especially in developing countries. This funding should be coupled with capacity-building initiatives and technology transfers.

- Energy efficiency measures: The improvement of energy efficiency should be prioritized. Governments need to incentivize energy-efficient practices across sectors and support research and development of energy-saving technologies.

- Strengthening regional cooperation: Collaboration at regional and international levels is critical for sharing experiences, best practices, and lessons learned. Regional energy integration can also enhance energy access and affordability by leveraging shared resources and infrastructure.

6. Conclusion

The achievement of SDG 7 is an urgent and indispensable step towards sustainable development. While progress is being made, it is evident that significant challenges await innovative and multi-dimensional solutions.

The Camões Instituto da Cooperação e da Língua calls upon all stakeholders - governments, international organizations, private sector entities, civil society organizations, and individuals - to actively contribute to the attainment of SDG 7. By working together towards universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy services, we can ensure a brighter and more sustainable future for all.
