Report on Sustainable Development Goal 7: Ensure Access to Affordable, Reliable, Sustainable and Modern Energy for All

Introduction:
Access to energy is critical for human development and well-being, enabling essential services such as healthcare, education, and communication, while driving economic growth and reducing poverty. However, around 1 billion people globally lack access to electricity, while 2.8 billion depend on traditional biomass for cooking and heating, leading to health and environmental implications. As we address these challenges, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) presents this report to shed light on the current state of Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7): Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all.

1. Overview of SDG 7:
SDG 7 is an integral part of the global development framework designed to tackle energy poverty and foster sustainable energy practices that promote economic opportunities, mitigate climate change, and safeguard health and well-being. Under SDG 7, three key targets have been established:
a) By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services.
b) Increase the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix.
c) Double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency by 2030.

2. Progress towards SDG 7:
Despite significant progress, gaps still persist in achieving universal energy access and transitioning towards sustainable sources. As of 2018, around 90% of the global population have access to electricity. However, in Sub-Saharan Africa, over 620 million people remain without electricity. Although renewable energy capacity is steadily growing, the share of renewables in the global energy mix is still around 17%, short of the target of 30%. Similarly, progress in energy efficiency improvement remains insufficient to meet the set goal.

3. Challenges in achieving SDG 7:
a) Lack of infrastructure: Limited access to reliable infrastructure poses a significant barrier to universal energy access. Feeble transmission and distribution networks, especially in remote and conflict-affected areas, hinder energy connectivity.
b) Affordability: High upfront costs of clean energy technologies often deter vulnerable groups from accessing energy, perpetuating energy poverty.
c) Technical and regulatory barriers: Limited knowledge, insufficient skills, and inadequate regulatory frameworks impede the adoption of renewable energy solutions and hinder the scaling up of projects.
d) Energy security: Geopolitical challenges, conflicts, and natural disasters disrupt energy systems, leading to significant setbacks in achieving the goals of SDG 7.
e) Environmental impact: The reliance on fossil fuels contributes to climate change and air pollution, underscoring the need for transitioning to sustainable energy resources.

4. Opportunities for action and collaboration:
a) Enhanced investment: Mobilizing adequate investment from public and private sectors is crucial, especially in developing countries, to build energy infrastructure, promote clean energy technologies, and support capacity-building efforts.
b) Innovative financing mechanisms: Leveraging innovative financial models such as impact investing, carbon pricing, and crowd-funding can facilitate access to affordable and sustainable energy solutions.
c) Strengthened policies and regulations: Comprehensive policy frameworks, regulatory advancements, and legal incentives are necessary to promote renewable energy adoption, energy efficiency, and clean cooking.
d) Technological innovation: The adoption of advanced energy technologies, including off-grid and decentralized solutions, can play a crucial role in bridging energy gaps.
e) International cooperation: Strengthening cooperation between governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector is vital in sharing best practices, transferring technology, and mobilizing resources for sustainable energy development.

Conclusion:
Efforts towards ensuring universal and sustainable energy access, as envisioned by SDG 7, are crucial for human development, poverty eradication, and climate action. The International Committee of the Red Cross recognizes the complex challenges faced globally and emphasizes the importance of collective action, policy support, financial commitment, and transformative technological interventions to achieve the ambitious targets outlined in SDG 7.
