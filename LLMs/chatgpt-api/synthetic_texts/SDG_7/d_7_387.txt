1. Introduction
The Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all by 2030. As the World Bank Group, we pride ourselves in being at the forefront of efforts to achieve sustainable development, and in this report, we will provide a detailed analysis of the current state of SDG 7, its progress, challenges, and potential solutions.

2. Overview of SDG 7 and its targets
SDG 7 comprises five targets, which are:
a) Ensuring universal access to modern energy services.
b) Increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix.
c) Improving energy efficiency at all levels.
d) Enhancing international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology.
e) Expanding infrastructure and upgrading technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services to all countries.

3. Progress towards achieving SDG 7
Despite progress in expanding energy access, particularly in developing countries, challenges remain, and achieving SDG 7 by 2030 requires accelerated efforts. According to the latest data, approximately 860 million people still lack access to electricity, and around 2.8 billion people lack access to clean cooking fuels and technologies. We estimate that to meet the universal access target, an additional 620 million people will need to gain access to electricity by 2030.

4. Increasing the share of renewable energy
Renewable energy is a crucial component of SDG 7, and its deployment has seen significant progress globally. However, while the global share of renewable energy in the total final energy consumption has increased, it is still not enough to meet the target of a substantial increase. Without proper policy incentives, investments, and regulatory frameworks, it will be challenging to reach the 2030 goal. Governments must prioritize renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal, to create a sustainable and low-carbon future.

5. Improving energy efficiency
Energy efficiency is a key driver in achieving SDG 7, as it not only reduces energy consumption and costs but also contributes to mitigating climate change. While substantial progress has been made in energy efficiency initiatives globally, a significant gap remains. Many countries still lack adequate policies, financial mechanisms, and technologies to promote widespread adoption of energy-efficient measures. Promoting energy-efficient practices, technologies, and conservation measures across sectors is essential for fast-tracking progress towards SDG 7.

6. Enhancing international cooperation and technology transfer
SDG 7 emphasizes the need for international cooperation to facilitate clean energy technology transfer to developing countries. Technology transfer can help bridge the sustainability gap, especially in areas such as renewable energy, energy storage, and grid integration. Collaborative partnerships involving governments, international financial institutions, and the private sector can play a vital role in promoting knowledge sharing, capacity building, and innovation in clean energy technology.

7. Expanding infrastructure and upgrading technology
Addressing the energy needs of all countries involves significant investments in infrastructure development and technology upgrades. Many developing countries face challenges in delivering affordable and sustainable energy services due to inadequate infrastructure, outdated technologies, and lack of investment. Mobilizing financial resources and creating an enabling environment for private sector participation are crucial in overcoming these barriers.

8. Challenges to SDG 7
Several challenges hinder the progress towards achieving SDG 7. These include limited financing options, particularly for developing countries, policy and regulatory barriers, lack of technical expertise, inadequate institutional capacity, and slow implementation of energy-related projects. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these challenges, disrupting energy systems and affecting the livelihoods of millions. Addressing these barriers requires a multi-stakeholder approach with the involvement of governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector.

9. Conclusion and the way forward
The pursuit of SDG 7 requires urgent and concerted efforts to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. As the World Bank Group, we advocate for increased investments, policy reforms, and international cooperation to advance the agenda. We encourage governments to adopt comprehensive strategies that integrate renewable energy, energy efficiency, technology transfer, and infrastructure development. By prioritizing these aspects, we can accelerate progress towards SDG 7 and pave the way for a more sustainable and inclusive future for all.
