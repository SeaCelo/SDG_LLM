The Belgian Policy Plan for Development Cooperation is pleased to present this detailed analytical report on SDG 7 - Affordable and Clean Energy. This report aims to provide an expert audience with comprehensive insights into the current state of this Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). Through meticulous research and policy analysis, we intend to shed light on the key challenges, progress made, and future recommendations regarding sustainable energy access.

SDG 7 serves as a critical foundation for achieving multiple goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It focuses on ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. Energy proves to be a key enabler for economic growth, poverty reduction, healthcare provision, education, and several other key sectors. By addressing the energy needs of both developed and developing countries, SDG 7 provides a clear pathway towards fostering a sustainable and inclusive future.

Firstly, it is essential to understand the challenges hindering the achievement of SDG 7. As of recent estimates, approximately 770 million people still lack access to electricity around the world. Additionally, more than 2.8 billion people depend on traditional biomass for cooking and heating purposes, often exposed to harmful indoor pollutants. The existing energy systems, heavily reliant on fossil fuels, contribute to climate change, air pollution, and natural resource depletion.

Despite these challenges, considerable progress has been made over the past decade. The global electrification rate has increased from 83% in 2010 to 88% in 2018. Sub-Saharan Africa has witnessed significant improvements, with over 60 million people gaining access to electricity between 2010 and 2018. This progress is commendable; however, the current pace falls short of meeting the 100% electrification target by 2030.

Renewable energy sources have emerged as a crucial component of achieving SDG 7. The cost of renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power, has significantly decreased, leading to their wider deployment. Several countries, including Belgium, have made substantial investments in renewable energy development, infrastructure, and capacity building. These efforts have resulted in increased access to clean energy, reduced carbon emissions, and improved energy efficiency.

Nevertheless, challenges remain in developing renewable energy infrastructure and overcoming investment barriers. Adoption of clean energy technologies must be pursued hand in hand with building the necessary grid infrastructure, enabling energy storage solutions, and overcoming regulatory and policy obstacles. Collaboration with international partners and stakeholders is vital for knowledge sharing, mobilizing adequate financial resources, and fostering technology transfer.

In terms of future recommendations, a multifaceted approach is needed. It is crucial to prioritize clean and affordable energy in national development policies, integrating it into broader sustainable development strategies. Efforts should focus on mobilizing public and private investments for renewable energy projects, strengthening research and development, and promoting innovative financing mechanisms.

Capacity building remains integral to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy systems. Partnerships at the national, regional, and international levels should be strengthened to enable technology transfer, knowledge sharing, and policy coordination. Emphasizing gender equality and social inclusion in energy access initiatives will ensure that the most vulnerable communities are not left behind.

In conclusion, SDG 7 presents both challenges and opportunities in the pursuit of affordable and clean energy for all. By recognizing the importance of expanding energy access, investing in renewable energy, and adopting an integrated and comprehensive approach, we can create a sustainable and inclusive future. It is our hope that policymakers and stakeholders, guided by the insights and recommendations provided in this report, will take the necessary steps to accelerate progress towards achieving SDG 7.
