Executive Summary

As the world continues to grapple with rising energy demands, the fulfillment of Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) becomes increasingly crucial. The goal of ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all intersects with several other sustainable development goals, including poverty eradication, health, education, and combating climate change.

Introduction

This report assesses the current state of SDG 7, focusing on the progress made, challenges faced, and recommendations for achieving its targets. World Accord International Development Agency conducted an in-depth analysis to better understand the complex factors affecting energy access globally.

Global Overview

Despite notable achievements, a significant portion of the global population still lacks access to basic energy services. As of 2021, approximately 789 million people remain without electricity, mainly concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa and rural Asia. Furthermore, nearly 3 billion individuals still rely on traditional biomass sources such as wood and charcoal for cooking and heating, leading to severe health and environmental consequences.

Progress and Challenges

1. Access to Electricity: Progress has been made in expanding access to electricity, with the global electrification rate increasing from 78% in 2000 to 90% in 2020. Yet, challenges persist, particularly in rural areas and low-income regions. Inadequate infrastructure, high costs, and regulatory barriers hinder access to electricity for millions. Robust investment in off-grid and decentralized renewable energy solutions can bridge these gaps.

2. Clean Cooking: Although efforts have been made to improve access to clean cooking solutions, almost half of the global population still relies on polluting fuels. Indoor air pollution from inefficient cookstoves causes millions of premature deaths annually, mostly affecting women and children. Enhanced advocacy, collaboration, and subsidy programs can accelerate the transition to clean and efficient cooking technologies.

3. Renewable Energy: The transition to renewable energy sources has gained momentum. The share of renewable energy in the global energy mix reached approximately 18% in 2017, but reaching the target of 50% by 2030 requires intensified efforts. Investing in renewable energy technologies, particularly in emerging economies, can drive sustainable economic growth, job creation, and emissions reduction.

4. Energy Efficiency: Improving energy efficiency is crucial for achieving SDG 7. Despite significant progress, global energy efficiency improvements remain below the required rates. Enhancing energy efficiency in buildings, industries, and transportation systems can reduce energy demand, enhance energy security, and mitigate climate change.

Cross-cutting Challenges and Recommendations

1. Financing: The scale of investment required to achieve SDG 7 necessitates innovative financing mechanisms, especially in low-income countries. Mobilizing private sector investments, promoting green financing, and reducing financial risks can accelerate progress in electrification and energy transition.

2. Policy and Regulatory Frameworks: Governments must prioritize inclusive energy policies, create enabling environments, and strengthen regulatory frameworks to incentivize investments, foster market competition, and remove bureaucratic obstacles. This should include subsidies for clean energy systems, effective energy pricing mechanisms, and supportive regulations for renewable energy integration.

3. Technology Transfer and Capacity Building: Developing countries often lack the technological know-how to leverage renewable energy sources fully. International partnerships should prioritize technology transfer, capacity building, and knowledge sharing to empower local communities, enhance skills, and drive innovation in clean energy development.

Conclusion

SDG 7 serves as a catalyst for achieving sustainable development by ensuring universal access to modern energy services. While progress has been made, several challenges remain and require concerted global efforts. Through strategic investments, innovative financing, supportive policies, and technology transfer, we can unlock the transformative power of modern energy, spurring progress across multiple Sustainable Development Goals and creating a more equitable and sustainable world. World Accord International Development Agency reaffirms its commitment to supporting initiatives that address energy poverty and accelerate progress towards SDG 7.
