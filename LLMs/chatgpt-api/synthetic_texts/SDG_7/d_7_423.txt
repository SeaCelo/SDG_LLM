The International Women's Development Agency
Analytical Report on SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

Introduction
Climate change and lack of access to affordable and clean energy are among the key challenges today affecting women's lives and development around the world. This report focuses on SDG 7, which seeks to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. The International Women's Development Agency aims to analyze the current state of SDG 7, intricately addressing its targets, progress, challenges, and recommendations to achieve its objectives.

Targets and Progress Analysis

Target 7.1: By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services.

While progress has been made in ensuring universal access to electricity, remote rural areas often encounter challenges due to lack of infrastructure development and financial constraints. Women and girls in such areas mostly rely on traditional fuels, like biomass, and spend significant time collecting firewood and managing household energy needs, leading to health hazards and hindrance to economic and educational opportunities. It is imperative to address gender disparities by upscaling investments in renewable energy, expanding clean cooking solutions, and providing targeted financing, to ensure affordable access to modern and sustainable energy services for all.

Target 7.2: Increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix.

Renewable energy sources are crucial in mitigating climate change and achieving sustainable development. While there has been considerable progress in increasing the share of renewable energy, global investments and policy measures need to be strengthened. Furthermore, it is vital to ensure that these investments prioritize inclusivity and involve women as active participants and beneficiaries. Engaging women in the renewable energy sector as entrepreneurs, decision-makers, and technicians not only has positive social impacts but also helps create more diverse and innovative solutions.

Target 7.3: Double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency.

Energy efficiency is essential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, conserving resources, and ensuring sustainable energy systems. Achieving this target requires focused policies and practical actions that promote energy-efficient practices across sectors. While progress has been made, women often face challenges in accessing information, technologies, and training related to energy-efficient practices. To fully realize the potential of women as agents of change, it is necessary to invest in capacity-building programs, promote energy-efficient technologies suitable for women's productive and reproductive needs, and enhance access to microfinance for energy efficiency projects.

Target 7.a: Enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency, and advanced and cleaner fossil-fuel technologies, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technologies.

International cooperation plays a crucial role in bridging the technology gap and adequately addressing the energy needs of developing countries. However, there is still great potential for stronger collaboration, knowledge-sharing, and exchange of best practices in the field of clean energy research and technology. It is imperative to increase investments in research and development while prioritizing gender-sensitive technologies that empower women and mitigate the adverse effects of energy poverty on their lives.

Challenges and Recommendations

Despite notable progress, several challenges hinder the achievement of SDG 7, particularly in relation to gender equality and women's empowerment.

1. Gender inequalities: Traditional gender roles often reinforce the energy poverty faced by women and girls. Policymakers should integrate a gender lens in energy-related policies, ensuring that women have equal access to resources, technology, information, and decision-making processes within the energy sector.

2. Access to finance: Women, especially in marginalized communities, face challenges in accessing sufficient financial resources to invest in clean energy solutions. Special attention should be given to establishing gender-responsive financial mechanisms that enable women entrepreneurs to develop and scale up renewable energy ventures.

3. Capacity building and knowledge-sharing: Education and training play a vital role in empowering women to become active participants in the sustainable energy sector. Governments and development partners must invest in capacity-building programs, technical trainings, and awareness campaigns targeting women and girls from diverse backgrounds to enhance their knowledge, skills, and confidence in managing clean energy technologies.

4. Multi-sectoral collaboration: Realizing SDG 7 requires collaboration between governments, civil society organizations, private sector entities, and international bodies. Partnerships need to be established to leverage resources, expertise, and innovations from various sectors to implement gender-responsive and sustainable energy solutions effectively.

Conclusion

SDG 7 identifies affordable and clean energy as a critical aspect of sustainable development, with immense potential to impact women's lives globally. To ensure progress towards this goal, it is crucial to address gender inequalities, enhance access to finance and capacity-building, facilitate technology transfer through international cooperation, and foster multi-sectoral collaborations. By striving for gender-responsive and inclusive energy policies and practices, we can unlock the full potential of women as agents of change and accelerate progress towards a sustainable and equitable future for all. Together, we can shape a world where affordable and clean energy is accessible to every woman and girl, empowering them to thrive and contribute to a sustainable planet.
