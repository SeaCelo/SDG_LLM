M. J. Akbar: Fueling Progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 7

Sustainable development encapsulates the multidimensional challenges faced by the global community today. As countries strive to achieve this noble endeavor, the United Nations articulated 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be pursued to transform our world for the better by 2030. Among these goals, SDG 7 stands tall as a catalyst for progress, focusing on ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. In this article, we will explore the importance of SDG 7, examine its interlinkages with other goals, and explore the potential avenues to achieve it.

At the center of SDG 7 lie two fundamental aspirations: universal electricity access and a transition towards cleaner and more sustainable energy sources. Access to electricity is a vital enabler of economic growth, education, healthcare, and advancements in almost every sphere of human development. It facilitates increased productivity, enhances living standards, and helps eradicate poverty. However, even today, staggering numbers reveal that approximately 789 million people lack access to electricity globally. Moreover, innumerable communities suffer from unreliable and ill-equipped energy infrastructure, hindering their potential for progress.

Furthermore, fossil fuels, the dominant energy sources powering the global economy, contribute to climate change and adversely impact the environment. The dichotomy lies in transitioning towards cleaner energy sources rapidly and advancing sustainable development without impeding economic growth. SDG 7 recognizes these challenges and endeavors to balance them through its objectives, which necessitate substantial investments in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and research and development of sustainable technologies.

SDG 5, aimed at achieving gender equality, presents a crucial intersection with SDG 7. Energy poverty disproportionately affects women and girls, comprising 60% of the global population without access to electricity. This lack of access limits women's opportunities for economic growth and exacerbates existing gender disparities. Consequently, prioritizing gender-responsive energy policies and investments within SDG 7 becomes imperative.

Similarly, interlinkages emerge with SDG 3, focusing on good health and well-being. Access to electricity plays a pivotal role in healthcare delivery, enabling the functioning of medical facilities, refrigeration of vaccines, and lighting during emergencies. A reliable and clean energy supply can foster better healthcare outcomes, especially in remote and underserved regions, ultimately contributing to achieving universal health coverage.

Furthermore, SDG 13, centered on climate action, reinforces the sustainable energy transition outlined in SDG 7. By substituting fossil fuel-dependent energy systems with renewables such as solar, wind, and hydro, countries can significantly reduce carbon emissions, thereby mitigating climate change's effects. Combining efforts from both goals will generate a positive feedback loop, aiding the transition to a low-carbon economy while ensuring energy access for all.

To successfully achieve SDG 7, governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector must collaborate strategically. Policymakers need to create an enabling environment that encourages investment in renewable energy infrastructure, enhances energy efficiency, and eliminates perverse incentives for fossil fuel usage. This requires conducive policies, regulatory frameworks, and long-term commitments towards promoting sustainable energy.

Moreover, adequate funding mechanisms, such as green bonds and development assistance, can unlock financial resources that assist developing countries in their energy transition journeys. Innovations, both in technology and financing models, are critical to achieving SDG 7 targets effectively.

In conclusion, SDG 7 serves as a catalyst for sustainable development, focusing on universal energy access and transitioning towards renewable sources. Interlinkages with other goals like gender equality, health and well-being, and climate action underscore the integrated nature of the SDGs. Recognizing the need for collaborative efforts across sectors and geographies, we can propel progress towards a sustainable future. With commitments and actions aligned, the vision of SDG 7 – ensuring access to affordable and clean energy for all – can be transformed into a reality, fostering inclusive and resilient societies worldwide.
