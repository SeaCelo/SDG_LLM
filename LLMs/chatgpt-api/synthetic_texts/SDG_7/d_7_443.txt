1. Introduction

Since its adoption by the United Nations General Assembly in September 2015, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have played a pivotal role in guiding global efforts towards a more sustainable future. SDG 7, specifically, aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all.

As an international development organization dedicated to achieving SDGs, SNV Netherlands Development Organisation has conducted an in-depth analysis of the current state of SDG 7. In this analytical report, we will examine the progress made, challenges faced, and potential solutions for the attainment of SDG 7.

2. Current State of SDG 7

Access to clean and modern energy is indispensable for human development, poverty reduction, and economic growth. Despite notable advancements in energy access, significant challenges remain on a global scale. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), approximately 840 million people still lack access to electricity, and around 2.6 billion rely on traditional biomass such as wood, charcoal, and animal waste for cooking and heating.

2.1 Energy Access

The primary objective of SDG 7 is to ensure universal access to electricity and clean cooking solutions. Over the past decade, electricity access has improved, with the global electrification rate rising from 79% in 2008 to 89% in 2018. However, progress has been uneven, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where the electrification rate lags behind at only 45%.

Moreover, reliance on primitive cooking methods has serious health, environmental, and socio-economic consequences. The inefficient combustion of biomass fuels leads to indoor air pollution, which results in approximately 4.3 million premature deaths each year. Additionally, the time spent gathering fuel contributes to gender inequality and hinders opportunities for education and income generation.

2.2 Renewable Energy Integration

The transition to sustainable energy sources is a fundamental aspect of SDG 7. To date, the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix has steadily increased, reaching 17.5% in 2017. However, the pace of adoption and integration varies across regions and sectors. Developed countries tend to have more advanced renewable energy infrastructures, while developing nations face barriers such as limited financial resources, outdated grid systems, and policy challenges.

2.3 Energy Efficiency

Improving energy efficiency is a crucial strategy for achieving SDG 7 and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, progress in this area has been insufficient, with global energy intensity improvements reducing at a slower pace in recent years. Greater effort is needed in sectors such as industry, buildings, and transportation to enhance energy performance through technological advancements and sustainable practices.

3. Challenges and Strategies

3.1 Financing and Investment

Insufficient financing remains a critical challenge for realizing SDG 7. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), an annual investment of USD 750 billion is required to ensure universal energy access by 2030. However, current investment levels fall short, reaching only around USD 450 billion in 2020.

To address this gap, a blend of public, private, and international financing is essential. Governments must enhance investment frameworks, create enabling environments for private sector involvement, and explore innovative financing mechanisms such as blended finance, green bonds, and impact investment.

3.2 Policy and Regulatory Frameworks

The complex nature of energy systems necessitates clear and supportive policy and regulatory frameworks. Governments must establish predictable market conditions, facilitate investments, and provide regulatory certainty to attract renewable energy developers and create favorable conditions for scaling up energy access solutions. Additionally, policies that promote energy efficiency and decarbonization are crucial in achieving SDG 7 targets.

3.3 Technology Transfer and Capacity Building

Technology transfer and capacity building play a crucial role in accelerating the development and deployment of sustainable energy solutions. Developed countries must fulfil their commitment to providing adequate support to developing nations, both in terms of technological know-how and financial resources. Capacity building programs should focus on enhancing local technical skills, strengthening institutions, and promoting knowledge-sharing platforms.

4. Conclusion

Although significant progress has been made towards achieving SDG 7, the global effort must be intensified to overcome challenges and attain universal access to affordable and clean energy. Through increased financing and investment, supportive policy frameworks, and technology transfer, SNV Netherlands Development Organisation believes that SDG 7 can be accomplished, bringing us closer to a sustainable and equitable future for all.
