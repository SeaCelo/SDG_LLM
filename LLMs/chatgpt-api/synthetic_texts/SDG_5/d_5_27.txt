1.Introduction
The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) is pleased to present this detailed analytical report, focusing on Sustainable Development Goal 5 (SDG 5) and its impact on least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries. SDG 5, also known as "Achieve Gender Equality and Empower All Women and Girls," is crucial for ensuring a sustainable and inclusive future for all.

2.Current Situation
A. Least Developed Countries (LDCs)
LDCs face unique challenges in achieving gender equality and empowering women and girls. Despite progress in recent years, significant gender inequalities persist in many LDCs. Women in these countries still face limited access to basic services and formal employment, lack of political representation, and are vulnerable to various forms of violence and discrimination.

B. Small Island Developing States (SIDS)
Gender equality and women's empowerment in SIDS have seen significant improvements, thanks to targeted policies and investments. However, these gains are still not satisfactory. Women in SIDS continue to experience inequality in economic opportunities, decision-making processes, and accessing quality education and health services. Furthermore, they bear the disproportionate burden of climate change impact, exacerbating existing gender inequalities.

C. Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs)
LLDCs represent some of the most economically challenged countries globally. Their geographical limitations lead to reduced opportunities for economic growth and development, compounding existing gender disparities. Women and girls in LLDCs face structural barriers that restrict their participation in economic activities and limit their access to education, healthcare, and reproductive rights.

3.Main Issues and Challenges
A. Traditional Gender Roles and Stereotypes
Deep-rooted traditional gender roles and stereotypes continue to hinder progress towards gender equality in all three country categories. The prevalence of patriarchal values and norms imposes limitations on the roles and capabilities of women and perpetuates discrimination and violence against them. Challenging and changing these societal norms pose significant challenges.

B. Economic Empowerment and Employment
Access to decent work remains a pressing concern for women in all target country categories. LDCs face high rates of unemployment and informality, with limited job opportunities and prevailing gender wage gaps. SIDS and LLDCs struggle with ensuring women's equal participation in key economic sectors and decision-making processes. Addressing these disparities requires targeted policies that promote women's economic empowerment through skills development, access to credit, and greater representation in decision-making positions.

C. Education and Health
Gender disparities in education and health have both short-term and long-term implications. Despite progress in reducing gender gaps, LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs continue to face several challenges, including insufficient resources, inadequate infrastructures, gender stereotypes, and societal obstacles. Addressing these challenges is crucial to ensure equitable access to quality education, affirm reproductive rights, and guarantee comprehensive healthcare services for women and girls.

D. Violence against Women
All target countries experience high levels of violence against women, amplifying gender inequalities and hindering social and economic progress. Addressing this pervasive issue requires legislative and policy reforms, public awareness campaigns, and strengthened institutions to ensure justice and protection for survivors.

4.Policy Recommendations and Interventions
To accelerate progress towards gender equality and women's empowerment, targeted policy interventions are required for each of the target country categories:

A. Least Developed Countries (LDCs)
1) Enhance women's economic empowerment through skills training, access to credit, and entrepreneurship support.
2) Strengthen women's political participation and decision-making through gender quotas and capacity-building programs.
3) Eradicate gender-based violence through comprehensive legal frameworks, support services, and awareness-raising campaigns.
4) Improve girls' access to quality education by addressing barriers such as early marriage, cultural norms, and distance to schools.

B. Small Island Developing States (SIDS)
1) Promote gender-responsive policies and planning frameworks for addressing climate change impacts.
2) Increase access to credit and markets for women entrepreneurs, particularly in sectors such as tourism, agriculture, and fisheries.
3) Implement targeted programs to enhance women's participation in decision-making at all levels.
4) Invest in comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services and preventive measures.

C. Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs)
1) Facilitate women's access to economic resources, markets, and employment opportunities through targeted vocational training and access to finance.
2) Strengthen women's participation and representation in the governance and management of natural resources.
3) Improve access to quality education and healthcare services in rural areas and remote regions.
4) Allocate resources towards combatting gender-based violence, including establishing support systems and shelters.

5.Conclusion
Achieving SDG 5, "Achieve Gender Equality and Empower All Women and Girls," in least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries requires persistent and targeted efforts. Addressing deep-rooted gender inequalities, transforming social norms, and implementing gender-responsive policies will be the key to economic and social progress for these countries. UN DESA is committed to supporting these countries in accelerating progress and achieving gender equality for a sustainable and equitable future for all.
