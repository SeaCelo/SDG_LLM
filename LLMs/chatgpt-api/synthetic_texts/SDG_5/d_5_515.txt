1 Introduction

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a set of aspirations put forth by the United Nations in 2015 to guide global development efforts towards a more sustainable and equitable future. SDG 5 focuses on achieving gender equality and empowering women and girls. This article aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the importance of gender equality not only from a social perspective but also from an economic standpoint, with a particular emphasis on the role of accounting and economics in supporting the achievement of SDG 5.

2 Gender Equality and Sustainable Development

Gender equality is a fundamental human right and an essential precondition for sustainable development. Advancing gender equality is not only a matter of justice and morality but also a smart economic decision. Numerous studies have shown that societies that value and promote gender equality tend to have greater economic growth, enhanced labor force participation, improved productivity, and reduced poverty rates.

The importance of gender equality in driving sustainable economic development is well-recognized within the realm of accounting and economics. Accounting systems and economic policies play a crucial role in shaping social norms, allocating resources, and reflecting gender biases. Moreover, a gender-responsive accounting and economic system is essential for measuring progress towards gender equality and monitoring the impact of policies and interventions.

3 Gender and Accounting

Accounting is a crucial tool for assessing and addressing gender inequalities in society and the economy. Gender-responsive accounting, also known as gender-sensitive accounting, seeks to incorporate gender issues into financial reporting, management accounting, and auditor decision-making processes. By employing gender analysis in accounting practices, it becomes possible to highlight the economic invisibility of women, discriminatory practices against women, and the gendered impact of economic decisions.

The gender pay gap, for instance, can be better understood and addressed through gender-responsive accounting. This methodology allows for the identification and elimination of pay disparities between men and women by monitoring and reporting the gender breakdown of wages and compensations. Additionally, gender-responsive accounting can help to track and assess the progress of gender balance in corporate leadership roles and boardrooms.

Furthermore, accounting can also contribute to measuring the unpaid care work often performed by women, which is usually excluded from economic analysis. By accounting for unpaid care work, policymakers gain a more accurate understanding of the economic contribution of women and the distributional consequences that neglecting this type of work can have on gender equality.

4 Economics and Gender

Economics has an essential role in understanding and addressing gender disparities. Mainstream economic analysis has often ignored gender issues, leading to policy interventions and outcomes that perpetuate gender inequality. Gender-aware economics acknowledges that traditional economic frameworks fail to fully capture the gendered dimensions of society, labor markets, and resource allocation.

A gender-aware economic analysis recognizes the different ways women and men participate in the economy, highlighting gendered divisions of labor, discrimination, systemic biases, and market failures that disadvantage women. It encourages the integration of gender considerations into economic models to produce more accurate policy recommendations and to challenge conventional assumptions.

Measuring the economic impact of gender inequalities is vital to progress towards SDG 5. The adoption of gender-budgeting techniques can help identify the gendered implications of fiscal policies, thereby providing a means of evaluating their impact on gender equality. Such techniques involve assessing how public expenditures and revenue raising affect men and women differently and can assist nations in better directing their resources to promote gender equality and sustainable development.

5 Conclusion

The achievement of SDG 5, gender equality, requires the involvement and contribution of diverse stakeholders, including accountants, economists, policymakers, businesses, and civil society. The discipline of accounting provides valuable tools and methodologies to address gender inequality, such as gender-responsive accounting practices that can help measure and monitor progress. Likewise, a gender-aware economics analysis contributes to a better understanding of the structural and systemic barriers to gender equality, allowing for policy interventions that promote sustainable development.

Overall, by recognizing the importance of gender equality for sustainable development and integrating gender considerations into accounting and economic frameworks, global efforts can be accelerated to achieve SDG 5 and create a more inclusive and equitable future for all.
