Achieving Gender Equality and Empowering All Women and Girls

October 2025

Introduction

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of the progress, challenges, and opportunities in relation to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5: Achieving Gender Equality and Empowering All Women and Girls. As an international organization committed to combating poverty and advocating for social justice, Oxfam strives to advance gender equality and bring attention to the underlying issues perpetuating gender disparities worldwide. With this report, we aim to provide an expert audience an in-depth assessment of the current implementation of SDG 5, discussing key achievements, persistent challenges, and potential strategies for a more gender-equal future.

Progress Overview

Since the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, considerable progress has been made towards SDG 5. Many countries have acknowledged the importance of this goal and integrated it into their national policies and strategies. Additionally, numerous legal reforms around the world have aimed to strengthen women's rights and eliminate discriminatory practices.

Key Achievements

1. Legal Reforms: Several countries have enacted legislation to promote gender equality and protect women's rights. For example, Ireland passed the Gender Pay Gap Information Act in 2021, mandating employers to disclose gender pay gaps, thereby encouraging more equitable compensation practices.

2. Political Participation: A significant milestone in achieving SDG 5 has been the increased representation of women in political decision-making bodies. For instance, Belgium and Rwanda stand out as leaders in this regard, with women holding around 50% of parliamentary seats.

3. Educational Attainment: Progress has been made globally in improving girls' access to education, reducing gender disparities at primary and secondary levels. This is exemplified by countries like Nepal, which reduced its out-of-school rate for girls by half, presenting opportunities for enhanced empowerment and economic prospects.

Challenges and Persisting Gender Inequalities

1. Gender-Based Violence: Gender-based violence remains a critical barrier to gender equality, affecting women and girls across the world. Addressing this issue requires multifaceted interventions, including legal frameworks and robust systems for prevention, protection, and support for survivors.

2. Economic Empowerment: Despite advancements in education, women and girls still face a significant gender gap in economic opportunities. Limited access to credit, entrepreneurship training, and discriminatory hiring practices contribute to persistent gender inequalities in the labor market.

3. Unpaid Care Work: The unequal distribution of unpaid care work burdens women, impeding their ability to engage in paid employment and public life. Social norms and traditional gender roles continue to reinforce this unequal division of caregiving responsibilities.

Enhancing Gender Equality and Empowerment: Strategies and Recommendations

1. Policy Coherence and Accountability: Governments should integrate gender equality across all national policies and ensure comprehensive coordination among various sectors. Furthermore, strengthening institutional mechanisms for monitoring and evaluating progress is crucial to hold stakeholders accountable for achieving proposed gender equality targets.

2. Investing in Women's Health and Education: Health and education programs targeting women and girls should be prioritized, paying particular attention to sexual and reproductive health services and quality education. This will contribute to breaking the cycle of intergenerational poverty and inequality.

3. Strengthening Women's Economic Empowerment: Governments and corporations should support initiatives that enhance women's economic opportunities, such as promoting gender-responsive budgeting, accessible childcare, and training programs focused on entrepreneurship and financial literacy.

4. Engaging Men and Boys: To achieve transformative gender equality, engaging men and boys is vital. Programs promoting positive masculinity and challenging harmful gender norms can contribute to fostering more egalitarian relationships.

Conclusion

Although significant strides have been made towards SDG 5, gender inequalities persist, hindering the progress of societies globally. This report has presented a comprehensive analysis of achievements, challenges, and strategies to advance gender equality and empower all women and girls. By implementing the aforementioned recommendations, we can collectively propel progress towards creating a more gender-equal world, leaving no one behind. As Oxfam, we remain committed to working with governments, civil society, and individuals towards achieving a society where women and girls can fully exercise their rights, unlock their potential, and contribute to sustainable development.
