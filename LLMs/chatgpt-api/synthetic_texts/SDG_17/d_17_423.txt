Executive Summary:

This report analyzes the progress and challenges of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 17: "Partnerships for the Goals" from a gender perspective. The goal seeks to strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize global partnerships for sustainable development. The analysis focuses on the actions needed to empower women, the importance of international cooperation, and the barriers hindering progress. Strategies to accelerate gender equality within SDG 17 are also presented.

1. Introduction:

SDG 17 emphasizes collaboration, partnerships, and coherence across all sustainable development goals. The International Women's Development Agency (IWDA) acknowledges the intrinsic link between gender equality and sustainable development. In line with their priorities, this report investigates the challenges faced by women and the opportunities to leverage partnerships for their empowerment.

2. Gender Equality in SDG 17:

SDG 17 recognizes the importance of gender equality in achieving sustainable development. However, despite efforts, progress remains inadequate. Women's unequal access to resources such as financial services, technology, and decision-making positions hampers their active participation in partnerships in various sectors.

3. Implementing Gender-Responsive Partnerships:

To bridge the gender gap, partnerships under SDG 17 must prioritize gender-responsive planning, implementation, and evaluation. This includes engaging women at all levels of decision-making processes and creating opportunities for their leadership. It is crucial to ensure an equal distribution of power, resources, and benefits within partnerships.

4. Addressing Barriers to Women's Empowerment:

Various structural barriers hinder women's participation and leadership within partnerships. These include discriminatory social norms, limited access to education and health services, and unequal representation in political and economic spheres. Addressing these barriers requires investments in education and skills development, promoting women's agency and autonomy, and transforming harmful gender norms.

5. Providing Access to Financing:

Financial inclusion is vital to empower women and enhance their contributions to sustainable development partnerships. Specific actions include creating gender-responsive financing mechanisms, improving access to credit, and promoting women's entrepreneurship. Additionally, investing in women-led enterprises and access to innovative financing models can foster inclusion, poverty reduction, and economic empowerment.

6. South-South and Triangular Cooperation:

Partnerships involving multiple stakeholders, such as South-South and triangular cooperation, provide unique opportunities for gender equality. These partnerships can offer knowledge sharing, technical assistance, and resource mobilization to address gender disparities and support sustainable development initiatives. Ensuring women's active participation and leadership in these collaborations is essential.

7. Strengthening Global Partnerships:

SDG 17 stresses the role of international cooperation in achieving sustainable development. Efforts should include financial assistance, technology transfer, capacity building, and knowledge sharing with a gender lens. Development finance institutions should also mainstream gender equality into development assistance policies and programs.

8. Monitoring and Accountability:

To monitor progress, sufficient data disaggregated by sex and other relevant variables should be collected, analyzed, and shared. Reporting should also highlight gender-sensitive indicators to assess the impact of partnerships on women's empowerment and rights. Strengthening accountability mechanisms will help identify areas requiring improvement and ensure the implementation of gender-responsive SDG 17 actions.

9. Conclusion:

This report highlights the importance of gender-responsive partnerships within SDG 17 and outlines key strategies to enhance women's empowerment for sustainable development. Gender equality must be at the center of collaboration efforts to ensure inclusive and equitable partnerships that drive transformative change. International Women's Development Agency urges stakeholders to prioritize gender mainstreaming at all levels and take concerted action to accelerate progress towards achieving SDG 17.
