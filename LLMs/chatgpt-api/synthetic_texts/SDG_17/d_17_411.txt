EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report analyzes the progress made towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 17 (SDG 17), focusing on the European context. SDG 17 aims to revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development, with particular attention to the means of implementation. The European Sustainable Development Organisation (ESDO) acknowledges the importance of international cooperation in addressing global issues and the need for effective partnerships to achieve the SDGs.

INTRODUCTION

The implementation of SDG 17 is paramount in guiding policies and actions for all the other sustainable development goals. It recognizes the interconnectedness of the goals and emphasizes the importance of collaboration among governments, civil society, private sector, and other stakeholders to achieve the sustainable development agenda by 2030.

CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR PARTNERSHIPS

The Europe 2020 strategy serves as a guiding framework for the European Union's implementation of SDG 17. Recognizing the necessity for partnerships, the EU has actively engaged in various kinds of collaborations and coalitions to foster sustainable development at both regional and global levels.

Effective partnerships necessitate the inclusivity of all stakeholders. In this regard, the EU has emphasized the importance of engaging with civil society organizations, the private sector, academia, and youth organizations. Collective action is fostered through regular stakeholder consultations and platforms that promote dialogue, knowledge sharing, and coordination of efforts.

INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT AID

International cooperation lies at the heart of SDG 17, as it is crucial for tackling transboundary issues and strengthening global solidarity. The European Union understands the need to enhance policy coherence for sustainable development, ensuring that development assistance aligns with long-term sustainability objectives and respects the principles of ownership and aid effectiveness.

The commitment to Official Development Assistance (ODA) remains a crucial aspect of SDG 17. However, challenges persist in meeting the ODA target of 0.7% of gross national income (GNI). While some EU member states have made strides towards achieving this target, others continue to fall short. Strengthening the commitment to mobilize resources in support of sustainable development projects in developing countries is an area that requires collective effort and sustained political will.

FINANCING FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

One of the key issues under SDG 17 is financing for sustainable development. The EU recognizes that additional and innovative resources are needed beyond traditional funding sources. In this context, the European Union has formulated strategies for mobilizing public and private finance.

The European Investment Bank (EIB) plays a crucial role in promoting sustainable development, providing financing through a variety of instruments such as loans, guarantees, and grants. Furthermore, in collaboration with the private sector, the EU has established mechanisms such as the European Fund for Strategic Investment (EFSI), aiming to stimulate investments in sustainable projects across Europe.

KEY CHALLENGES AND WAY FORWARD

SDG 17 faces several challenges in its implementation. Coordinated efforts at both the European and international levels are required to overcome these challenges. Key areas that ESDO identifies for attention include:

1. Strengthening multilateral cooperation: The EU should continue to foster international cooperation, promote policy coherence, and coordinate efforts among countries to tackle global challenges.

2. Enhanced resource mobilization: The EU, along with its member states, needs to prioritize meeting the target of 0.7% of GNI as ODA. This could be achieved by increasing public awareness, encouraging private sector participation, and exploring innovative sources of financing.

3. Bridging the digital divide: Ensuring equitable access to information, technology, and innovation is crucial for sustainable development. The EU should continue to invest in digital infrastructure and build capacities, particularly in developing countries, to promote inclusive and sustainable development.

CONCLUSION

SDG 17 serves as a reminder of the importance of partnership and cooperation in achieving the broader sustainable development agenda. The European Union has embraced this ethos by actively engaging with various stakeholders and implementing strategies to mobilize resources and promote sustainable development. While challenges persist, by collectively addressing them, the EU remains committed to achieving long-term, inclusive, and sustainable development by 2030.
