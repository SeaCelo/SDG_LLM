Introduction

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of the progress and challenges pertaining to Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) - "Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all," with a specific focus on least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs). As an agency affiliated with the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), this report targets an expert audience that includes policymakers, development practitioners, and researchers working on water and sanitation issues in these country groups.

1. Overview of SDG 6 and Current Progress

SDG 6 emphasizes the fundamental importance of water and sanitation for human well-being, health, and sustainable economic growth. It sets ambitious targets to ensure universal access to safe water, sanitation facilities, and proper hygiene practices by 2030. However, the challenges confronted by LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs in achieving these targets are distinct due to their specific contextual factors.

2. Challenges faced by LDCs in achieving SDG 6

LDCs, characterized by high poverty rates and limited resources, encounter multifaceted obstacles in meeting SDG 6 targets. These challenges include limited access to safe drinking water, inefficient water governance systems, inadequate sanitation infrastructure, and weak institutional capacities. Political instability, armed conflicts, and natural disasters further exacerbate these challenges, impeding progress towards sustainable water and sanitation management in LDCs.

3. Specificities of SDG 6 implementation in SIDS

SIDS face unique hurdles in achieving SDG 6 due to their geographical characteristics, susceptibility to climate change impacts, and small economies of scale. The management and sustainability of freshwater resources in SIDS are heavily influenced by issues such as water scarcity, vulnerability to sea-level rise, land degradation, and limited capacity for storage and water reuse. Achieving safe and affordable sanitation services, particularly in remote and sparsely populated islands, remains a pivotal challenge in SIDS.

4. Constraints faced by LLDCs in implementing SDG 6

LLDCs encounter specific challenges related to their geographic disadvantage of being landlocked, which affects access to freshwater resources, sanitation facilities, and technologies for sustainable water management. Limited access to coastal resources, dependency on transboundary water basins, and high transport costs for water-related infrastructure development impede progress towards SDG 6 targets. Investment in water infrastructure and regional cooperation for resource allocation and management are critical for LLDCs to advance their water and sanitation agenda.

5. Key Strategies for accelerating SDG 6 progress in target countries

To fast-track progress in achieving SDG 6 in LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs, a holistic approach is required, integrating various strategies. These may include improvements in water resource management, policy coherence, institutional strengthening, innovative technologies, capacity building, and investment in infrastructure. Synergies between SDG 6 and other related goals, such as SDG 13 (Climate Action) and SDG 14 (Life Below Water), should be mainstreamed to efficiently address cross-cutting challenges.

6. Innovative practices for water and sanitation management in target countries

Promising practices implemented in specific LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs serve as inspiration for achieving sustained progress in SDG 6. These include the promotion of rainwater harvesting, decentralized wastewater treatment systems, cross-sectoral integrated water resources management, community-led initiatives, and technology-driven approaches. South-South and triangular cooperation also provide valuable opportunities for exchange of experience, expertise, and successful models for sustainable water and sanitation management.

7. Long-term implications and policy recommendations

Ensuring sustainable management of water and sanitation in LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs has far-reaching implications in terms of human development, poverty eradication, climate resilience, and achieving sustainable economic growth. It necessitates deeper collaboration, investment mobilization, and targeted policy interventions. This report recommends the prioritization of water and sanitation investments, strengthening of institutional frameworks, upscaling innovative practices, knowledge-sharing platforms, and robust monitoring and reporting mechanisms to accelerate progress towards SDG 6 in these country groups.

Conclusion

SDG 6, aimed at universal access to clean water and sanitation, poses distinct implementation challenges in LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs. This report highlights the unique obstacles faced by these country groups and presents the strategies, innovative practices, and policy recommendations required to advance SDG 6 progress. Achieving sustainable water and sanitation management in these countries contributes not only to goal 6 but also towards achieving multiple other SDGs ultimately building resilient and inclusive societies.
