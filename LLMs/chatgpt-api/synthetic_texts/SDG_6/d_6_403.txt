Introduction 

This analytical report focuses on the current progress and challenges related to Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) - Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. As an expert organization in the development sector, Catholic Relief Services (CRS) has a deep commitment to addressing water and sanitation issues. 

Overview of SDG 6 

SDG 6 aims to ensure equitable access to and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all by 2030. This goal encompasses several specific targets, including achieving universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water, improving water quality and sanitation services, increasing water-use efficiency, and protecting and restoring water-related ecosystems.

Progress and Challenges 

1. Access to water and sanitation services: 

Significant progress has been made in improving access to clean water and sanitation facilities, particularly in urban areas. However, disproportionately, large proportions of rural communities and marginalized populations, including those living in remote areas and informal settlements, still lack adequate access to these services. Furthermore, achieving universal access requires addressing both the quantity and quality of water supply, as well as promoting good hygiene practices.

2. Water quality and sanitation services:

Though progress has been observed in increasing access to improved sanitation facilities, challenges remain in ensuring sustainable service delivery. Effective waste management, onsite sanitation systems, and wastewater treatment facilities often require significant investments in infrastructure and operation costs. Integrated approaches to tackle this issue are needed, combining infrastructure upgrades with hygiene education and behavior change interventions.

3. Water-use efficiency:

Efforts to improve water-use efficiency have gained momentum, seeking to minimize water losses, promote water recycling, and enhance agricultural practices. However, much more is needed to advance innovative solutions, such as water-sensitive urban design, drip irrigation systems, and the adoption of water-saving technologies in industries. Ensuring sustainable and efficient use of water resources is crucial to responding to both current and future demands.

4. Protection and restoration of water-related ecosystems:

Restoration and preservation of water-related ecosystems are essential for water security and biodiversity conservation. Many water bodies suffer from pollution, habitat degradation, and ecological imbalances due to industrial activities, urbanization, and unsustainable agriculture. It is crucial to invest in ecological restoration and establish measures to ensure sustainable management and protection of these ecosystems.

5. Resilience to water-related disasters:

Climate change exacerbates the challenges related to water management, fostering droughts, floods, and other water-related disasters. Enhancing resilience to these disasters necessitates implementing effective early warning systems, better disaster preparedness strategies, and infrastructure plans that consider climate change scenarios and promote social resilience. It is imperative to strengthen cooperation and knowledge exchange among countries to address transboundary water-related risks and adapt to climate uncertainties adequately.

Recommendations 

1. Strengthening partnerships and cooperation:

Addressing the complex challenges of SDG 6 requires collaboration across sectors and various stakeholders, including governments, civil society organizations, academia, and private entities. CRS encourages all concerned actors to work together to leverage their expertise, resources, and networks and jointly develop sustainable water and sanitation solutions.

2. Catalyzing investment in infrastructure:

Ensuring reliable access to clean water and safe sanitation facilities necessitates significant investments in infrastructure development, including water treatment and distribution systems, sanitation and sewage systems, and waste treatment facilities. Governments and international donors should allocate adequate funds, prioritize investment in water and sanitation sectors, and explore innovative financing mechanisms to bridge the investment gap.

3. Strengthening institutional and policy frameworks:

Building institutional and policy capacity among national and local governments is vital to implement integrated water resources management approaches effectively. CRS recommends reinforcing legislative frameworks, promoting cross-sectoral coordination, and enhancing transparency and accountability mechanisms. In addition, adopting nature-based solutions and participatory governance models can ensure sustainable and inclusivewater governance.

Conclusion 

SDG 6 is pivotal to achieving sustainable development goals and requires collective action to address the complex challenges of water and sanitation. Catholic Relief Services emphasizes that equitable access to clean water and sanitation improves health, enhances livelihoods, promotes gender equality, and reduces poverty. By strengthening partnerships, catalyzing investment, and strengthening institutional frameworks, progress towards SDG 6 can be accelerated, contributing to a more equitable, resilient, and sustainable world.
