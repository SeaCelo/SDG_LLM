Water is an essential resource for sustaining life on Earth and is vital for achieving sustainable development. With this in mind, the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) presents this detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) - ensuring access to water and sanitation for all. As a regional financial institution focused on Caribbean development, we have closely examined the progress made, challenges encountered, and opportunities for future actions in the pursuit of SDG 6 in our region.

The Caribbean region faces various water-related challenges, including scarcity, management issues, and vulnerability to external shocks such as climate change and natural disasters. These challenges impact the availability, quality, and sustainability of water resources, as well as access to basic sanitation services. Our report aims to shed light on these issues and enable policymakers, practitioners, and international partners to make informed decisions to drive progress towards SDG 6 in the Caribbean.

Firstly, let us address the progress achieved so far. Several Caribbean countries have made significant strides in improving water access and sanitation services. Many have implemented policies and legislations to strengthen water governance, enhance water resource management, and promote water conservation. Notably, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, and Trinidad and Tobago have achieved universal access to improved water sources, reflecting a commendable commitment to SDG 6.

However, there is much more work to be done to ensure universal access to clean and safe water and sanitation across the entire region. Despite progress in some countries, disparities persist within and between nations. Rural and marginalized communities, such as those living in informal settlements and remote areas, continue to face the greatest challenges in accessing safe drinking water and adequate sanitation facilities. Therefore, efforts must be intensified to achieve equity, inclusivity, and leave no one behind in accessing these essential services.

Moreover, the Caribbean's vulnerability to climate change exacerbates the water challenges faced by the region. Rising sea levels, changing rainfall patterns, and increased incidence of extreme weather events pose significant threats to water resources and infrastructure. Hurricanes, in particular, can lead to severe damage to water supply systems, contamination of water sources, and the prioritization of emergency response over long-term water management.

Recognizing the region's vulnerability, the CDB has been actively supporting its borrowing member countries in building climate resilience, including water-related infrastructure and planning. We have provided funding and technical assistance to improve water resource management, develop integrated water supply systems, and strengthen early warning systems for climate-related disasters. These efforts align with SDG 6's target of increasing water-use efficiency, enhancing water productivity, and combating water stress.

Despite the achievements and ongoing initiatives, challenges persist in achieving SDG 6 in the Caribbean. Limited financial resources, inadequate data collection and analysis, and a lack of integrated planning and coordination between sectors hinder progress. Strategic investments in infrastructure, technology, education, and innovation are required to address these challenges effectively.

To accelerate progress towards SDG 6, partnerships and collaboration within the Caribbean region, as well as international cooperation, are crucial. Sharing knowledge, best practices, and experiences among countries can foster innovation and allow for the implementation of context-specific approaches. Public-private partnerships, along with increased private sector investment in water and sanitation, can also unlock new solutions and resources to address the financing gap.

In conclusion, achieving SDG 6 in the Caribbean requires concerted efforts, innovative approaches, and multi-stakeholder collaboration. The CDB stands ready to support our borrowing member countries in designing and implementing sustainable water management strategies, enhancing infrastructure resilience, and promoting inclusive and equitable access to water and sanitation. By leveraging the lessons learned and sharing best practices, the Caribbean can overcome obstacles and build a more water-secure and sustainable future for all.

Let us work together to ensure that every person in the Caribbean has access to clean water and sanitation services, thus contributing to improved health, well-being, and the overall sustainable development of the region.
