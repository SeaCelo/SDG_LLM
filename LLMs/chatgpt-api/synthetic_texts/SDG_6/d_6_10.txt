Introduction

The Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) aims to ensure access to clean water and sanitation for all. As we live in an increasingly interconnected and urbanized world, the global water crisis is exacerbated by various factors such as population growth, climate change, and inefficient water management systems. This report, prepared by the Economic Commission for Europe (ECE), provides a comprehensive analysis of the current status of SDG 6 and highlights key challenges and opportunities for its achievement.

Access to Clean Water

Access to clean and safe water is a fundamental human right essential for human survival and development. Currently, 785 million people lack basic drinking water services, with around 2 billion relying on contaminated water sources. This not only threatens public health but also perpetuates poverty and inequality. Progress in expanding access to clean water has been made in some regions, however, significant disparities still exist between urban and rural areas. Ensuring equitable access to clean water requires innovative approaches to infrastructure development, water resource management, and capacity-building programs, particularly in developing countries.

Sanitation and Hygiene

Access to basic sanitation and adequate hygiene practices is essential to prevent the spread of diseases, promote public health, and uphold human dignity. Despite significant progress in increasing access to basic sanitation, 2.4 billion people still lack access to improved sanitation facilities. Open defecation remains a persistent challenge, affecting the quality of water sources and exacerbating health risks. Hygiene practices, including handwashing, are often neglected, leading to preventable diseases and deaths, especially in areas with limited education and awareness. Addressing these issues requires targeted interventions, political will, and collaboration among governments, civil society, and the private sector.

Water Scarcity and Quality

Water scarcity, exacerbated by climate change, population growth, and pollution, poses a severe threat to sustainable development. Currently, one-third of the global population lives in water-stressed areas, and this number is projected to increase. Moreover, freshwater ecosystems are under pressure due to unsustainable water management practices and pollution, affecting biodiversity and ecosystem services. Integrated water resources management, including efficient allocation, conservation, and sustainable use, is crucial to ensuring water availability for all users. Strengthening water governance, enhancing water infrastructure, and promoting investments in sustainable water solutions are essential for addressing water scarcity and ensuring water quality. 

Transboundary Cooperation

Many water resources are transboundary, which necessitates regional and international cooperation for effective management. Fragile political relations, conflicting interests, and limited institutional frameworks often pose challenges to transboundary water cooperation. Engaging in dialogue, promoting trust, and adopting cooperative agreements are vital for resolving conflicts and effectively manage shared water resources. The ECE contributes to this effort by enhancing transboundary cooperation among the UNECE region member countries, facilitating dialogue, knowledge-sharing, and capacity-building initiatives.

Target 6.5 - Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM)

The effective implementation of IWRM is critical for achieving SDG 6. By integrating various dimensions of water management, including environmental, social, economic, and governance aspects, IWRM ensures a holistic and sustainable approach. However, the current pace of IWRM implementation is slow globally. Variations in institutional capacities, governance structures, and policy frameworks pose challenges to the adoption of comprehensive IWRM practices. Building technical capacities, fostering coordination among stakeholders, and aligning policies with the principles of IWRM are key to accelerating progress in this area.

Conclusion

While progress has been made towards the achievement of SDG 6, critical challenges remain. Achieving universal access to clean water and sanitation, addressing water scarcity, and ensuring transboundary cooperation require innovative solutions, political commitment, and sustained investments. The ECE, through its regional initiatives and partnerships, continues to support its member countries in implementing SDG 6, fostering sustainable water management, and promoting cooperation to address the water crisis. By focusing efforts and resources on SDG 6, we can contribute to building a more equitable, resilient, and sustainable future for all.
