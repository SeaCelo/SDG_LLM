Access to clean water and sanitation is a fundamental human right, yet millions of people around the world are still struggling without it. Lack of water, poor sanitation facilities, and improper waste management continue to pose significant challenges to global development. To address this urgent issue, the United Nations has set up the Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6): Clean Water and Sanitation. In this article, we will explore the critical role that businesses can play in achieving SDG 6 and ensuring a sustainable future for all.

SDG 6 aims to ensure universal access to clean water and adequate sanitation facilities by 2030. It recognizes that water scarcity, poor water quality, and inadequate sanitation services disproportionately affect marginalized communities, exacerbate poverty, and hinder economic growth. While governments and NGOs play pivotal roles in addressing these challenges, businesses have a unique opportunity to contribute their expertise, resources, and capacity for innovation.

One prime example of business involvement in achieving SDG 6 is through strategic partnerships. Collaborations between businesses, governments, and civil society organizations can pool together diverse skills and resources to have a greater impact. For instance, the partnership between Coca-Cola and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) aimed to improve access to clean water and sanitation facilities in several developing countries. The collaboration leveraged Coca-Cola’s knowledge of local water sources, infrastructure development, and promotion of sustainable utilization to ensure the availability of clean water in areas most in need.

Moreover, businesses can be champions for water conservation and efficiency within their own operations. Freshwater ecosystems are under severe stress due to excessive consumption, pollution, and climate change. Therefore, implementing water-saving technologies, investing in wastewater treatment systems, and promoting responsible water usage can make a substantial difference. Firms like Nestlé have taken the lead in responsibly managing water resources. Through their “Good Water Practices” initiative, they aim to preserve and restore water sources, educate farmers on efficient water usage in agriculture, and invest in local water infrastructure, thereby aligning their business goals with sustainable water management.

In addition to partnerships and responsible operations, businesses can drive innovation to revolutionize water and sanitation solutions. The development of new technologies can provide affordable and sustainable alternatives to traditional sanitation systems or help mitigate water scarcity in water-stressed areas. Companies like Ecofiltro are utilizing entrepreneurial approaches to tackle the challenge. They produce affordable water filters, targeting rural communities in Latin America and Africa, thus ensuring safe drinking water by removing harmful contaminants and pathogens.

Investment in SDG 6 also presents a significant business opportunity. The World Health Organization estimates that every dollar invested in clean water and sanitation results in economic benefits ranging from $3 to $34, depending on the region. For corporate leaders, aligning business strategies with SDG 6 objectives can lead to enhanced brand reputation, increased market surety, and improved access to capital. By demonstrating a commitment to sustainability, businesses can attract socially-conscious consumers and investors, fostering innovation, growth, and resilience.

However, it is essential to acknowledge the inherent challenges that businesses may encounter in pursuing social and environmental sustainability, including water and sanitation goals. Balancing short-term profitability with long-term impact, navigating complex supply chains, and ensuring equitable access to water resources pose substantial hurdles. Yet, these challenges serve as an opportunity for companies to exercise leadership, harness collaboration with diverse stakeholders, and contribute to the achievement of SDG 6 in a collective and responsible manner.

In conclusion, businesses have a vital role to play in achieving SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation. By developing strategic partnerships, adopting responsible water management practices, driving innovation, and investing in sustainable solutions, they can positively influence access to clean water and sanitation worldwide. Furthermore, businesses can reap significant economic benefits by aligning their operations with the principles of SDG 6. The journey towards universal access to clean water and sanitation may be challenging, but through concerted efforts and a shared vision, businesses can contribute towards building a world where water insecurity becomes an issue of the past.
