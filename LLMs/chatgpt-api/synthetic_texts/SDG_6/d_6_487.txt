Access to clean water and sanitation is a basic human right that shouldn't be taken for granted. Unfortunately, in many parts of the world, millions of people still lack these basic necessities, leading to dire consequences for their health, education, and overall well-being. Recognizing this global challenge, the United Nations has taken a significant step toward addressing the issue by adopting the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 - "Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all."

SDG 6 is a crucial piece in the puzzle of achieving a sustainable future. As stated in the goal, the aim is to ensure universal access to safe and affordable drinking water for everyone by 2030. Similarly, it aims to improve water quality, increase water-use efficiency, and support the sustainable management of water resources globally. Moreover, the SDG emphasizes the importance of adequate sanitation facilities and proper hygiene practices for all, with particular attention to women and girls.

Water scarcity and pollution are pressing challenges faced by nations across the globe. Closer to home, India has struggled with water-related issues for decades. With a population of over 1.3 billion people, India's water resources are under tremendous stress. In many regions, water scarcity is a daily reality, impacting agricultural productivity, economic growth, and human well-being.

To address these challenges, India has shown a strong commitment to achieve SDG 6. Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Jal Jeevan Mission in 2019, with the goal of providing every household with piped water supply by 2024. This ambitious initiative aims to deliver safe and clean drinking water to over 165 million rural households across the nation. Through measures such as water conservation, rainwater harvesting, and groundwater recharge, the government aims to improve water availability and accessibility in both rural and urban areas.

India's efforts to ensure water and sanitation for all are crucial, not only for its own population but also for international ripple effects. As one of the world's largest and fastest-growing economies, India's success in achieving SDG 6 could serve as a model for other developing countries facing similar challenges. It is a testament to the importance of multi-sectoral partnerships, involving governments, civil society organizations, and the private sector, to create sustainable solutions for water management and sanitation.

In addition to governmental interventions, individual actions can play a role in achieving SDG 6. Every drop counts, and small actions can have a significant impact. Taking shorter showers, fixing leaky faucets, and practicing responsible water conservation at homes are just a few ways individuals can contribute to this global goal. Educating ourselves and raising awareness about the importance of water and sanitation issues is also vital.

Furthermore, businesses have a crucial role to play in water stewardship and resource management, particularly regarding water-intensive industries like agriculture, energy, and manufacturing. Adoption of sustainable practices and technologies, investing in water infrastructure, and managing water as a shared resource should be among their key priorities.

Despite the undeniable progress made, the road to achieving SDG 6 is still a challenging one. It requires sustained investment, political will, and collective action. Governments, organizations, and individuals must collaborate closely to ensure that no one is left behind in accessing safe water and sanitation services. Moreover, concerted efforts to restore and protect our water bodies from pollution are essential to safeguard our ecosystems and biodiversity.

The Sustainable Development Goal 6 stands as a beacon of hope for millions around the world who are still deprived of one of life's most basic necessities. As we strive to recover from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and build back better, let us not forget the importance of water and sanitation for a healthy and sustainable future. Together, we can ensure that no one is left behind in the pursuit of clean water for all. This is not only the responsibility of governments or organizations but of every individual, because in the end, the Sustainable Development Goals are not just a global agenda; they are a shared responsibility.
