1. Introduction

Access to clean water and sanitation is a fundamental human right, essential for the preservation of life and the achievement of sustainable development. Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) aims to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. This report, prepared by the Austrian Development Agency (ADA), provides an analytical assessment of the current status of SDG 6, outlining the achievements, challenges, and recommendations necessary to meet the targets by 2030. Targeting an expert audience, the report offers a comprehensive understanding of the progress in water and sanitation.

2. Overview of SDG 6

SDG 6 is comprised of six ambitious targets that cover a wide range of issues related to water and sanitation. These targets include universally accessible and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water, adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all, improvement of wastewater treatment, significant reduction in water pollution, integrated water resources management, and protection and restoration of ecosystems related to water.

3. Progress of SDG 6: Achievements

Considering the first target of universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water, progress has been made globally. According to recent data, 2.6 billion people have gained access to improved drinking water sources since 1990. However, there is still much work to be done, as millions of people still lack access to safe drinking water, particularly in low-income countries.

The second target, which aims to achieve adequate and equitable sanitation for all, also demonstrates considerable progress. Since 2000, the proportion of the global population with access to improved sanitation facilities has increased by 21%. Nonetheless, 2.3 billion people continue to lack basic sanitation, posing significant health risks and hindering progress towards other development goals.

Efforts to improve wastewater treatment, with the target of substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse around the world, have shown promising advancements. However, only 28% of collected wastewater undergoes treatment, leading to severe environmental degradation and risks to human health.

4. Challenges of SDG 6

While progress has been made in some areas, several challenges persist. First and foremost, financing remains a considerable obstacle. Adequate funding needs to be mobilized to bridge the financial gap for water and sanitation infrastructure investment, particularly in developing countries.

Furthermore, issues surrounding water scarcity and access remain significant challenges, particularly in arid and water-stressed regions. Climate change exacerbates this situation, intensifying droughts and directly impacting water availability.

The deteriorating quality of freshwater bodies, resulting from pollution from various sources, is yet another challenge. This pollution not only affects drinking water sources but also poses threats to aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity. Contamination through inadequate wastewater management and chemical runoff from agriculture and industrial activities further adds to this challenge.

5. Recommendations for Meeting SDG 6 Targets

To address these challenges and achieve SDG 6 by 2030, a multi-faceted approach is required. The following recommendations should be considered:

a) Strengthening national and regional governance: Countries must develop robust policies, strengthen institutions, and improve governance frameworks to enhance water and sanitation management.

b) Mobilizing financial resources: International cooperation and increased investments from both public and private sectors are vital. Innovative financing mechanisms, such as blended finance and partnerships with the business community, should be explored to close the financial gap.

c) Prioritizing water scarcity and access: Countries need to develop comprehensive water resource management plans, focusing on conservation and increased efficiency. Investments in infrastructure, such as water harvesting systems and efficient irrigation technologies, are essential to address water scarcity and ensure equitable access.

d) Improving wastewater treatment: Integrated wastewater management systems, including appropriate treatment facilities and standards, must be implemented to protect water resources and human health. Embracing innovative technologies, such as decentralized treatment systems and water reuse practices, can contribute to addressing this challenge.

e) Enhancing water quality through pollution control: Integrated efforts encompassing stricter regulations, improving industrial and agricultural practices, and strengthening wastewater treatment can mitigate water pollution issues. Localization of pollution sources through monitoring and enforcement plays a vital role in ensuring water quality.

6. Conclusion

The analysis presented highlights the achievements and challenges faced in meeting SDG 6. To ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, concerted efforts are needed from various stakeholders. Building partnerships and mobilizing financial resources are crucial, along with prioritizing water scarcity, quality, and improved sanitation. By implementiing the recommendations outlined in this report, significant progress towards achieving SDG 6 by 2030 can be made, fulfilling the fundamental human right to water and sanitation and advancing sustainable development.
