In recent years, the issue of extreme poverty has emerged as one of the pressing challenges facing human societies across the globe. It is a fundamental problem that affects not only individuals and families, but also jeopardizes the social fabric and stability of communities and nations. Recognizing the magnitude of this challenge, the United Nations has enshrined the eradication of extreme poverty as their first Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 1). In this article, I aim to shed light on the importance of SDG 1 and outline some strategies for achieving it, drawing from my own research and expertise.

Before delving into the intricacies of SDG 1, it is critical to understand the context behind its formulation. The adoption of the SDGs in 2015 represented a landmark moment for the international community, as it heralded a new era of global cooperation in tackling major global challenges in a comprehensive and integrated manner. The lofty ambition of the SDGs, consisting of 17 goals and 169 targets, was to achieve sustainable development in its economic, social, and environmental dimensions by 2030.

SDG 1, titled "No Poverty," stands out among its counterparts as the bedrock upon which the other goals are built. It recognizes that without eradicating extreme poverty, it will be impossible to achieve sustained and inclusive economic growth, reduce inequalities, promote social justice, and protect the environment. Moreover, SDG 1 embodies the principle of leaving no one behind, ensuring that the benefits of development reach all individuals, especially the most marginalized and vulnerable in society.

To comprehend the significance of SDG 1, one must engage with the dimensions of poverty it seeks to address. The commonly employed measure of extreme poverty, established by the World Bank, defines it as living on less than $1.90 a day. However, poverty is a multi-faceted issue that goes beyond income deprivation. It encompasses lack of access to basic necessities such as food, clean water, education, healthcare, and housing. Moreover, poverty can also manifest as social exclusion, discrimination, and limited political participation.

My research has shown that extreme poverty has both immediate and long-term negative consequences for individuals and societies. Economically, poverty perpetuates a cycle of deprivation, preventing individuals from acquiring the human capital necessary to escape poverty. This, in turn, hampers productivity, innovation, and economic growth. Socially, poverty engenders social unrest, crime, and other syndromes rooted in despair and hopelessness. Politically, poverty undermines democratic institutions and exacerbates inequalities, paving the way for social and political instability.

To eliminate extreme poverty by 2030, as outlined in SDG 1, a multifaceted and integrated approach is required. First and foremost, it is vital for countries to accelerate economic growth and maintain macroeconomic stability to generate decent and sustainable employment opportunities. It is important to recognize that growth cannot be an end in itself, and inclusive measures must be implemented to ensure that the benefits of growth are spread evenly and reach the most marginalized communities.

Moreover, education and skills training play a critical role in breaking the cycle of poverty. Investing in quality, accessible education equips individuals with the tools they need to escape poverty, secure gainful employment, and actively participate in the economy and society. By strengthening educational institutions, ensuring equal opportunities and access, and facilitating lifelong learning, countries can foster human development and eradicate poverty at its roots.

Healthcare is also integral to SDG 1. Universal healthcare coverage should be pursued as a means to reduce inequalities and ensure basic medical services reach every person, regardless of their socio-economic status. Correspondingly, social protection programs, such as cash transfers and access to basic social services, not only provide a safety net for the most vulnerable, but also stimulate local economies by increasing purchasing power.

Finally, promoting sustainable practices and protecting ecosystems is crucial in achieving SDG 1 in the long run. Environmental degradation exacerbates the vulnerability of poor communities and can even drive individuals into poverty. Combining poverty eradication efforts with climate action and sustainable resource management is essential for achieving lasting and inclusive prosperity.

In conclusion, SDG 1, the eradication of extreme poverty, plays a pivotal role in fostering sustainable development and promoting socio-economic well-being for all. It encapsulates the multidimensional nature of poverty, addressing income deprivation, lack of basic necessities, social exclusion, and limited political participation. By adopting a concerted approach, integrating economic growth, education, healthcare, and environmental sustainability, countries can overcome this global challenge and pave the way for a more equitable and sustainable future. Achieving SDG 1 requires collective efforts from governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector, signaling that eradicating extreme poverty is not only morally imperative, but also a key driver of prosperity and stability worldwide.
