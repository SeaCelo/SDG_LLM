Despite some progress made towards achieving SDG 1, which aims to end poverty in all its forms everywhere, there are still significant challenges and disparities within the member states of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). This report aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the current situation in the region, focusing on key indicators and factors that contribute to or obstruct the achievement of SDG 1.

1. Poverty Rates:
The CIS region encompasses a diverse range of countries and economies, each with its own unique socio-economic conditions. Poverty rates vary greatly across the member states, from countries with relatively low levels of poverty such as Russia and Kazakhstan, to countries like Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, where poverty rates remain persistently high. Despite recent economic growth in many countries, the gap between the rich and the poor continues to widen, exacerbating inequality and hindering SDG 1 progress.

2. Rural-Urban Divide:
One of the key challenges in the region is the rural-urban divide in poverty rates. Rural areas often suffer from inadequate infrastructure, limited access to basic services such as education and healthcare, and a lack of economic opportunities. This results in higher poverty rates in rural regions compared to urban areas. Efforts should be focused on uplifting rural communities by enhancing agricultural productivity, investing in rural infrastructure, and promoting inclusive economic growth.

3. Gender Inequality:
Gender inequality is another barrier to achieving SDG 1. Women in the CIS region face numerous challenges, including gender-based discrimination, limited access to education and economic opportunities, and an unequal burden of unpaid care work. Gender gaps persist both in employment rates and wages, contributing to higher poverty rates among women. Addressing gender disparities and advancing gender equality should be an integral part of poverty eradication strategies.

4. Vulnerable Groups:
Special attention should be given to vulnerable groups that are disproportionately affected by poverty. This includes children, elderly people, persons with disabilities, and other marginalized populations. Caring for these groups requires targeted social protection measures, access to quality healthcare and education, and promoting their inclusion in decision-making processes and economic activities.

5. Sustainable Economic Growth:
Sustained and inclusive economic growth is vital for poverty eradication. While some countries in the CIS region have experienced economic growth in recent years, it is essential to ensure that the benefits are evenly distributed and reach the most vulnerable populations. Diversifying the economy, investing in human capital development, fostering innovation and promoting responsible business practices will contribute to robust and sustainable economic growth, reducing poverty in the long term.

6. Social Protection Systems:
Establishing and strengthening social protection systems is crucial to protect the most vulnerable populations from poverty and provide them with a basic social safety net. These systems should include access to social assistance, health insurance, education services, and affordable housing. Coordinated efforts among member states are necessary to develop comprehensive and effective social protection programs, while ensuring their long-term sustainability.

7. International Cooperation:
Poverty eradication cannot be achieved by individual countries alone. International cooperation, partnerships, and knowledge-sharing are essential to address common challenges and achieve SDG 1. Member states of the CIS should actively engage with multilateral organizations such as the United Nations, World Bank, and regional development banks, while fostering regional cooperation initiatives to leverage resources, expertise, and experiences.

In conclusion, while progress has been made towards ending poverty in the CIS region, significant challenges persist. Achieving SDG 1 requires a holistic and integrated approach that tackles the structural causes of poverty, ensures equitable access to opportunities, strengthens social protection systems, and fosters sustainable economic growth. By addressing key factors that obstruct progress, Member states can move closer to achieving SDG 1 and improving the living conditions and well-being of all their citizens.
