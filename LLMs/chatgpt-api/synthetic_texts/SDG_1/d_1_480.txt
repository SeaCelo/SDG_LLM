Millennium Development Goals had paved the way towards significant progress in reducing poverty and improving livelihoods across the globe. Retaining the momentum, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were established in 2015 with a broader vision. Among the 17 goals, SDG 1 holds a paramount significance as it focuses on eradicating extreme poverty in all its forms by 2030. This single objective encapsulates the core values of equity, social justice, and inclusive development.

Poverty has a pervasive impact on numerous facets of human life and deprives individuals of their basic human rights and dignity. The goal of SDG 1 is designed to tackle the multi-dimensional aspects of poverty that extend beyond income disparities. It aims to eradicate extreme poverty by aligning economic growth with social protections, creating access to quality education, healthcare services, and promoting sustainable livelihoods.

One of the fundamental aspects of addressing poverty is ensuring inclusive and equitable economic growth. Poverty is not solely a consequence of low-income levels but also of limited access to economic opportunities. To alleviate this situation, SDG 1 focuses on creating decent and sustainable jobs that provide fair income, labor rights, and social protection to all individuals. Moreover, it emphasizes the importance of empowering women, youth, and marginalized groups in order to bridge existing gender and social gaps.

Education is a crucial instrument in breaking the cycle of poverty. The SDG 1 understands this and places a significant emphasis on ensuring equal access to quality education at all levels. Education goes beyond the provision of basic literacy skills. It enables individuals to acquire knowledge, skills, and competencies necessary for decent employment, entrepreneurship, and broader participation in society. Therefore, raising the quality standards of education and reducing disparities in access will be essential to eradicate poverty sustainably.

Access to adequate healthcare is an essential entitlement for every individual. Recognizing this, SDG 1 addresses the need for universal access to healthcare services, including essential medicines and vaccines. Health systems need to be strengthened and made more resilient to provide quality healthcare services, particularly to vulnerable populations, who are more prone to health adversities due to poverty.

A notable aspect of SDG 1 is its emphasis on building resilient and sustainable communities. Poverty-endemic regions often face greater vulnerability to natural disasters, climate change, and other external shocks. Therefore, the goal promotes the development of affordable, safe, and sustainable housing, mobilizes resources for disaster resilience, and ensures sustainable and inclusive urbanization processes, thus reducing the vulnerability of the poor.

The United States has made commendable strides towards addressing poverty through various initiatives and welfare programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). However, with persistent disparities and wealth inequality, further efforts are required to fully achieve the targets set by SDG 1.

Now more than ever, as the world grapples with the far-reaching impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of SDG 1 becomes clear. The economic downturn and disruptions in supply chains have pushed more individuals towards poverty. The goal's focus on inclusivity and reducing inequality is paramount in building back a fairer and more resilient society.

In conclusion, SDG 1 serves as a guiding framework for policymakers, civil society, and individuals alike to combat extreme poverty comprehensively. By addressing poverty with a holistic approach, encompassing economic growth, access to education and healthcare, disaster resiliency, and inclusive development, the goal provides a blueprint for creating a just and poverty-free world. Although challenging, with unwavering commitment, collaboration, and international solidarity, the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030 is an achievable goal that everyone should strive to support.
