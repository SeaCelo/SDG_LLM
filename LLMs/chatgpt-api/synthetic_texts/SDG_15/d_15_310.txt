The Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG 15) focuses on protecting, restoring, and promoting sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably managing forests, combating desertification, halting and reverse land degradation, and conserving biodiversity. This analytical report, prepared by the Azerbaijan International Development Agency (AIDA), is intended for an expert audience and provides a comprehensive analysis of the progress, challenges, and recommendations for Azerbaijan's efforts towards achieving SDG 15.

Overview:
Azerbaijan, located in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia, is rich in biodiversity and possesses diverse terrestrial ecosystems, including forests, wetlands, mountain ranges, and agricultural lands. However, like many countries, Azerbaijan faces diverse challenges to achieving SDG 15. This report aims to provide a detailed assessment of these challenges and proposes strategies to address them.

Status of Forest Management:
One of the crucial components of SDG 15 is sustainable forest management. In Azerbaijan, forests cover approximately 12% of the total territory, and the government has implemented various measures to ensure their conservation and responsible use. The State Forestry Agency has established forest monitoring systems to assess deforestation rates, illegal logging practices, and fire risks. However, despite these efforts, forest resources continue to face degradation due to unsustainable logging practices, insect pests, and climate change impacts. The report recommends strengthening forest governance, increasing investment in forest management, and promoting the use of sustainable forestry practices.

Combating Desertification and Land Degradation:
Azerbaijan is also a country vulnerable to desertification and land degradation, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. Excessive construction, inappropriate land use, soil erosion, and climate change have contributed to the expansion of desertification processes. The government has recognized these challenges and incorporated measures into national policies and programs to combat desertification and halt land degradation. The report advocates for strengthening the legal and regulatory framework to prevent further land degradation, promoting sustainable agricultural practices, and implementing effective reforestation and rehabilitation programs in affected areas.

Conserving Biodiversity:
Azerbaijan is home to a significant number of plant and animal species, many of which are endangered or at risk of extinction. The country's protected areas, such as national parks and nature reserves, play a crucial role in preserving biodiversity. Enhancing key biodiversity areas and establishing additional protected areas are essential components for achieving SDG 15. The report highlights the need for improved conservation management plans, public awareness campaigns, and inter-sectoral collaboration to conserve biodiversity effectively. Furthermore, the adoption of integrated landscape management approaches and sustainable development practices can promote the harmonized interaction between nature conservation and human activities.

International Cooperation:
International cooperation plays a critical role in achieving SDG 15, particularly in sharing knowledge, capacity building, and mobilizing financial resources. The report acknowledges the importance of multilateral partnerships and calls for increased engagement and collaboration with relevant international organizations such as the United Nations Development Programme, the Convention on Biological Diversity, and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. Active participation in global forums and learning from other countries' best practices can greatly contribute to advancing SDG 15 in Azerbaijan.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, Azerbaijan faces notable challenges in achieving Sustainable Development Goal 15. While the government has implemented various measures, concerted efforts and innovative approaches are vital. This comprehensive analysis and set of recommendations emphasize the importance of sustainable forest management, combating desertification and land degradation, conserving biodiversity, and strengthening international cooperation. By implementing these recommendations, Azerbaijan can make significant progress towards the ambitious targets of SDG 15, contributing to the overall sustainable development of the country.
