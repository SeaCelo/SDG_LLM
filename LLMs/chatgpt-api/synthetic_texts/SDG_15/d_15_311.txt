The present report aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG 15), focused on sustaining and preserving terrestrial ecosystems. This exploration is predominantly intended for an expert audience and has been drafted by the Belgian Policy Plan for Development Cooperation. By offering an in-depth understanding of the current state of affairs, challenges, progress, and recommendations, this report strives to contribute to informed decision-making and the successful implementation of SDG 15.

SDG 15, known as "Life on Land," aims to protect, restore, and promote the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, and halt biodiversity loss. The ultimate ambition of this goal is to ensure the conservation of biodiversity, maintain essential ecosystem services, and foster equitable access to natural resources.

Biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation continue to pose significant threats to human well-being and the sustainable development of nations. Deforestation, habitat destruction, land degradation, invasive species, and climate change are some of the main drivers of environmental decline. Recognizing the urgent need for action, SDG 15 makes a comprehensive appeal to all nations, policies, and institutions to converge efforts in safeguarding the planet's terrestrial ecosystems.

Belgium acknowledges the importance of addressing the challenges posed by SDG 15 and has consequently implemented various strategies to contribute to its achievement. The Interinstitutional Cooperation agreement on the Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the Belgian federal government promotes coordination and joint actions across relevant Ministries and Cooperation Agencies. This effort allows for a consistent approach to SDG implementation and accountability.

In order to achieve targets of SDG 15 effectively, the following key challenges must be addressed. Firstly, the issue of deforestation necessitates urgent attention, particularly in tropical forest regions. Afforestation and reforestation initiatives need to be supported by promoting sustainable forest management practices and combating illegal logging. Secondly, efforts should be directed towards sustainable agriculture practices that reduce land degradation and soil erosion. Enhancing technical capacity and transforming the current agricultural systems through education and research is critical in this regard. Furthermore, it is essential to address the increasing problem of invasive alien species, which have detrimental effects on ecosystems, agricultural productivity, public health, and many other sectors.

Belgium has made commendable progress towards SDG 15, primarily by actively participating in international efforts, collaborations, and partnerships. Engaging in multilateral initiatives such as the Convention on Biological Diversity and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change allows Belgium to contribute to global policy development and implementation related to SDG 15.

To further strengthen efforts towards SDG 15, Belgium must prioritize the integration of sustainability principles and biodiversity conservation into its national policies. This can be facilitated through the promotion of sustainable land use practices, effective environmental and social impact assessments, and fostering responsible private sector practices concerning land and ecosystem management.

In conclusion, SDG 15 remains of utmost importance to enable the sustainable development and preservation of terrestrial ecosystems for current and future generations. Belgium, through various policy actions, has made commendable progress in addressing the challenges associated with this goal, particularly through international cooperation and partnerships. However, sustained efforts, additional resources, and a holistic approach are required to overcome the remaining challenges. By prioritizing sustainable land use, enhancing biodiversity conservation, and promoting the sustainable management of forests, Belgium can play a critical role in advancing SDG 15 and ensuring life on land is preserved for all.
