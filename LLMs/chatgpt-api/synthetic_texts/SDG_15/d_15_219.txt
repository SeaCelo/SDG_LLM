The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15 known as "Life on Land" is one of the key pillars of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It focuses on protecting, restoring, and promoting sustainable land use, terrestrial ecosystems, and biodiversity conservation. As an economist and former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, I situate my discussion of SDG 15 within the broader context of sustainable development and economic growth.

Forests, mountains, rivers, and other terrestrial habitats are critical providers of ecosystem services that sustain life on our planet. Human activities such as deforestation, intensive farming, and the expansion of urban areas have severely impacted these natural habitats, disrupting ecosystems and putting biodiversity at risk. SDG 15 aims to reverse this trend by promoting sustainable land management and halting biodiversity loss.

The economic implications of SDG 15 are multifaceted. On one hand, terrestrial ecosystems are sources of income and livelihood for millions of people. Forests, for instance, provide timber, non-timber forest products, and ecosystem services that support local communities. Furthermore, protecting natural habitats can yield economic benefits through sectors such as tourism, renewable energy, and biotechnology. Sustainable land management practices can enhance agricultural productivity, reduce soil erosion, and improve water management, thereby boosting food security and enhancing resilience to climate change.

However, the economic value of terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity often goes unrecognized in traditional economic metrics such as GDP. Society tends to prioritize short-term economic gains over the long-term benefits of ecosystem services. To address this issue, policymakers should adopt a broader perspective that encompasses the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. Integrating natural capital accounting and ecosystem valuation into national accounts and decision-making processes is crucial for realizing the potential of sustainable land management.

Additionally, the achievement of SDG 15 requires a cross-sectoral and multi-stakeholder approach. Governments, civil society, communities, and the private sector need to collaborate and align their efforts to protect and restore terrestrial ecosystems. This entails promoting sustainable agriculture practices, reforestation, and afforestation, as well as establishing protected areas and wildlife corridors. It also necessitates addressing the underlying drivers of deforestation and land degradation, such as urbanization, infrastructure development, and unsustainable consumption patterns.

International cooperation plays an essential role in the implementation of SDG 15. Given the transboundary nature of biodiversity conservation and land use, coordination at regional and global levels is crucial. Initiatives like the Bonn Challenge and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets provide a platform for countries to mobilize resources, share best practices, and demonstrate commitment to sustainable land management. Financial mechanisms such as the Global Environment Facility also support developing countries in their efforts to implement SDG 15.

While progress has been made towards achieving SDG 15, significant challenges remain. Deforestation, habitat loss, and species extinction continue at an alarming rate, driven by factors such as population growth, land conversion for agriculture, and unsustainable consumption patterns. Furthermore, climate change poses a fundamental threat to terrestrial ecosystems, exacerbating the pressures on biodiversity.

In conclusion, SDG 15: Life on Land is a comprehensive framework that aims to protect and restore terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity. Its successful implementation requires a holistic approach that integrates economic, social, and environmental considerations. By recognizing the value of natural capital, adopting sustainable land management practices, and promoting cross-sectoral cooperation, we can achieve the long-term goal of sustainable development while preserving the fragile balance of life on land.
