Introduction:

This detailed analytical report aims to provide an expert audience with a comprehensive analysis of Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1), which focuses on eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions worldwide. As a priority target within the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, SDG 1 underscores the urgent need to address the complex challenges faced by populations living in extreme poverty and to create enabling environments for sustainable development.

Segment 1: An Overview of SDG 1

SDG 1 calls for the eradication of poverty in all its manifestations. It aims to lift people out of extreme poverty, ensuring that vulnerable groups have access to sustainable livelihoods, resources, and basic services. This goal emphasizes not only poverty reduction but also the broader concept of inclusive development, leaving no one behind.

Segment 2: Key Sub-targets and Indicators

To effectively address the multifaceted nature of poverty, SDG 1 encompasses several measurable targets and indicators. These sub-targets include:

1.1 By 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than $1.90 a day.
1.2 By 2030, reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women, and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions.
1.3 Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable.
1.4 Ensure that all men and women, in particular, the poor and the vulnerable, have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership, and control over land and other forms of property.
1.5 Build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerabilities to economic, social, and environmental shocks and disasters.
1.a Ensure significant mobilization of resources from a variety of sources, including through enhanced development cooperation, to provide adequate and predictable means for developing countries, particularly least developed countries, to implement programs and policies to end poverty in all its dimensions.
1.b Create sound policy frameworks at the national, regional, and international levels, based on pro-poor and gender-sensitive development strategies, to support accelerated investment in poverty eradication actions.

Segment 3: Progress and Challenges

SDG 1 has seen progress since its inception with a significant decline in global poverty rates. However, challenges persist, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, Southern Asia, and among marginalized groups. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated disparities and pushed millions back into poverty, highlighting the urgency of effective poverty eradication measures.

Segment 4: International Cooperation and Development Fund's (ICDF) Role

As an instrument for international cooperation, ICDF plays a crucial role in supporting the implementation of SDG 1. Through promoting partnerships, capacity-building initiatives, and financial support, ICDF aims to address the structural causes of poverty, facilitate economic empowerment, and ensure social protection for the most vulnerable populations.

Segment 5: Case Studies

To illustrate the implementation of SDG 1, this report presents two case studies. The first case study examines the success story of the Empowerment through Livelihood Program in a rural community in Sub-Saharan Africa. This program has employed a multi-dimensional approach, combining capacity-building, entrepreneurship development, and market integration to empower individuals and lift them out of poverty.

The second case study showcases a cash transfer program in South Asia, which has targeted the urban poor. The program provides direct monetary assistance to low-income families, helping them meet their basic needs and encouraging access to healthcare and education. Through rigorous monitoring and evaluation, the program has demonstrated positive impacts on poverty reduction and social inclusion.

Conclusion:

SDG 1's comprehensive framework, coupled with the dedication of stakeholders and targeted interventions, presents significant opportunities to eradicate poverty in all its forms. However, realizing this vision necessitates intensified efforts to mobilize resources, address systemic inequalities, and strengthen collaboration at national and international levels. By prioritizing poverty eradication and sustainable development, countries can make substantial progress toward achieving SDG 1 and fostering a more inclusive and equitable world for all.
