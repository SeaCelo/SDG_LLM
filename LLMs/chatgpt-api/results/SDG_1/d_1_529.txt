Title: Analysing the Relationship between Sustainable Development Goal 1 and Economic Growth: A Cross-Country Evaluation

Abstract:
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted by United Nations member states in 2015 as a framework to guide global action towards a sustainable future. Goal 1, namely "End poverty in all its forms everywhere," holds paramount importance as it aims to eradicate extreme poverty and ensure shared prosperity. This article attempts to critically analyze the relationship between SDG 1 and economic growth, employing a cross-country evaluation framework. By exploring the nexus between poverty eradication efforts and economic development policies, we aim to highlight key strategies for achieving simultaneous progress on both fronts.

1. Introduction:
The global community has made significant strides in reducing poverty levels over the past few decades. However, the challenge of completely eradicating extreme poverty by 2030, as envisioned by SDG 1, remains complex and multifaceted. This article delves into the interplay between efforts to end poverty and spur economic growth, offering nuanced insights for policymakers, economists, and development practitioners.

2. Theoretical Framework:
Understanding the relationship between poverty eradication and economic growth necessitates a robust theoretical foundation. We draw from the framework of inclusive growth, which posits that economic development should not only be measured by an increase in GDP but also be accompanied by equitable access to opportunities, resources, and social services. By aligning poverty alleviation efforts and economic growth, countries can ensure that the benefits of development are accrued by all.

3. The Linkage between SDG 1 and Economic Growth:
Empirical evidence suggests a strong intersection between prosperous economies and reduced poverty rates. By examining various case studies, we identify the pathways through which SDG 1 and economic growth mutually reinforce each other. Prudent macroeconomic policies, investment in human capital, infrastructure development, and facilitation of access to markets emerge as essential factors in fostering poverty reduction and enabling equitable economic growth.

4. Policy Measures and Best Practices:
To achieve sustained and inclusive economic growth, governments must consciously adopt policies aimed at reducing poverty and enhancing human development outcomes. This section evaluates the efficacy of several policy measures, including conditional cash transfer programs, investment in rural development, social protection schemes, and institutional reforms. Moreover, insights from successful poverty eradication initiatives in countries such as Brazil, Rwanda, and China shed light on best practices that can be replicated elsewhere.

5. Challenges and Recommendations:
Even with encouraging progress, numerous challenges persist in the pursuit of SDG 1. These obstacles include income inequality, spatial disparities, lack of access to public services, and vulnerability to external shocks. Drawing from qualitative and quantitative evidence, we discuss potential strategies to overcome these challenges. Suggestions include implementing comprehensive social protection systems, strengthening governance mechanisms, enhancing financial inclusion, and promoting sustainable investment practices.

6. Implications for Sustainable Development:
The successful realization of SDG 1 possesses significant implications for the overall achievement of the broader sustainable development agenda. Poverty is not only a deprivation of basic needs but also a root cause of various socio-economic problems, including hunger, illiteracy, and health disparities. By synthesizing the interactions between SDG 1 and other linked goals, such as education (SDG 4), health (SDG 3), and gender equality (SDG 5), this article underscores the centrality of poverty eradication in realizing sustainable development.

7. Conclusion:
This article underscores the importance of SDG 1 as a catalyst for transformative action towards poverty eradication and inclusive economic growth. It offers insights into the interdependencies between poverty reduction and successful economic development. The analysis and assessment of policy measures adopted by different countries shed light on effective strategies, enabling the formulation of evidence-based recommendations for policymakers and development planners. Achieving SDG 1 will require multi-sectoral collaboration and innovation to address systemic and structural issues that perpetuate poverty. It is essential for international stakeholders to continue prioritizing poverty eradication alongside economic growth to ensure a sustainable future for all.
