Introduction
In accordance with its mandate to promote sustainable development and alleviate poverty, Tearfund has prepared this comprehensive analytical report on SDG 1: No Poverty. This report is intended to provide an expert audience with a detailed assessment of the current status and challenges in achieving SDG 1, as well as suggesting innovative strategies to accelerate progress towards eradicating poverty.

1. Current Status of SDG 1: No Poverty
SDG 1 aims to eradicate extreme poverty and ensure that all people have equal access to basic services, ownership and control over productive resources, and social protection by 2030.

a) Global Overview: Our analysis reveals that although progress has been made in reducing poverty, significant challenges persist. According to the latest estimates by the World Bank, around 700 million people still live in extreme poverty, surviving on less than $1.90 per day. Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia continue to be the regions with the highest concentration of extreme poverty.

b) Multidimensional Poverty: While extreme poverty is a pivotal concern, it is equally important to address multidimensional poverty. This includes measuring access to education, healthcare, clean water, sanitation, and other critical social indicators. Progress has been achieved in many areas, but gaps in social services and infrastructure persist, particularly in low-income countries.

c) Inequality and Vulnerability: SDG 1 is closely related to SDG 10, as poverty and inequality are intertwined. Income and wealth disparities persist globally, posing a significant challenge to eradicating poverty. Vulnerable groups such as women, children, indigenous people, and persons with disabilities are disproportionately affected by poverty and require targeted efforts.

2. Key Challenges and Bottlenecks

a) Economic Factors: Economic growth is a crucial driver in poverty reduction, but inclusive and sustainable development is required to ensure that the benefits are shared. Many countries continue to struggle with low income levels, lack of formal employment opportunities, and limited access to credit and financial services for the poor.

b) Conflict and Fragility: Poverty is more prevalent in countries experiencing conflicts or political instability. Armed conflicts, fragility, natural disasters, and forced displacement hinder progress towards poverty eradication. Consequently, sustainable peace building and conflict resolution need to be prioritized to foster development in fragile settings.

c) Climate Change and Environmental Sustainability: Climate change exacerbates poverty due to its impact on agriculture, natural resources, and vulnerable ecosystems. Poor communities, who heavily rely on natural resources for their livelihoods, are disproportionately affected. Promoting sustainable and climate-resilient agriculture, conservation of ecosystems, and renewable energy, along with disaster risk reduction measures, are pivotal steps for minimizing vulnerabilities.

3. Strategies to Accelerate Progress

a) Social Protection: Developing inclusive social protection systems that cover the most vulnerable segments of society is essential in eradicating poverty. This includes providing access to quality healthcare, education, nutrition, and cash transfer programs to protect the poor from economic shocks and social exclusion.

b) Job Creation and Skills Development: Facilitating job creation through targeted interventions and fostering entrepreneurship can generate inclusive growth and income opportunities. Emphasizing skill development and vocational training equips individuals with the required competencies for gainful employment, contributing to poverty reduction.

c) Strengthening Governance and Institutions: Good governance, transparent and accountable institutions, and effective public administration are instrumental in poverty reduction efforts. Invest
