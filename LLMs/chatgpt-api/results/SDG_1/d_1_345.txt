SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL 1: NO POVERTY

Report by Slovak Aid on Current Status and Analytical Perspectives

Introduction:

This report aims to provide an insightful analysis of the progress made towards the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 1: No Poverty. Focused on eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, this goal signifies the fundamental necessity to ensure fair access to resources, opportunities, and basic services for every individual in every corner of the world. This report assumes an expert audience, seeking an in-depth analysis of the challenges, achievements, and strategies in addressing poverty.

1. Current Status:

Despite significant progress, poverty remains one of the most pressing challenges globally. According to recent data by the World Bank, around 9.2% of the world's population lived in extreme poverty in 2019, based on the international poverty line of less than $1.90 per day. Approximately half of the world's poor reside in Sub-Saharan Africa, while countries in South Asia also face substantial poverty levels.

In the context of Slovakia, substantial progress has already been achieved in reducing poverty rates. According to the Slovak Aid's National Report on Poverty Development, the national poverty rate decreased from 12.2% in 2012 to 6.8% in 2019. However, certain minority groups, particularly the Roma population, still face disproportionately high poverty rates.

2. Analytical Perspective:

(A) Relevance of Global Partnerships:

Collaboration between developed and developing nations is crucial in effectively addressing poverty. Slovak Aid has successfully been engaged in providing targeted assistance to alleviate poverty, primarily through exploring innovative partnerships. The agency has notably partnered with various stakeholders, including UN agencies, NGOs, and private sectors, channeling resources and expertise towards poverty reduction programs. Emphasizing the importance of coordination, this approach enhances the relevance, impact, and sustainability of development interventions.

(B) Advancements in Social Protection Measures:

To effectively combat poverty, robust social protection mechanisms play a critical role. Slovakia has made significant strides in providing social protection to vulnerable groups, most notably through the strengthening of its social welfare system and investments in human capital development. Slovak Aid has actively supported these efforts by providing technical cooperation and financial assistance to enhance social protection systems in recipient countries. These interventions focus on improving access to education, healthcare, and formal employment, thereby promoting sustainable livelihoods and reducing vulnerability to poverty.

(C) Addressing Structural Inequalities:

Engendering sustainable poverty eradication efforts requires a comprehensive strategy addressing structural inequalities. Slovak Aid acknowledges the need to assist partner countries in creating an enabling environment that fosters inclusive growth and equitable access to resources. Addressing gender equality, decent work, and reducing income inequalities are central aspects of tackling structural disparities. Slovak Aid's technical assistance programs have been instrumental in promoting gender-responsive policies and advocating for inclusive social and economic reforms.

(D) Strengthening Capacity Development:

Building robust capacities at national and local levels is pivotal to poverty eradication. Slovak Aid recognizes the importance of tailored capacity-building initiatives in recipient countries. These interventions aim to enhance local ownership and empower communities to take an active role in poverty reduction strategies. By fostering knowledge exchange platforms, offering technical trainings, and supporting institution-building projects, Slovak Aid plays a vital role in strengthening capacities for sustainable development, thereby contributing effectively to SDG 1.

3. Conclusion:

In conclusion, efforts toward achieving SDG 1, No Poverty, have produced significant outcomes. Slovakia has made substantial progress in reducing national poverty rates, demonstrating a commitment to combating poverty. The relevance of global partnerships, advancements in social protection measures, addressing structural inequalities, and fostering capacity development are critical aspects of Slovak Aid's approach in tackling poverty. However, challenges still persist, and greater efforts are needed, particularly in addressing intergenerational and multidimensional aspects of poverty.

To achieve lasting change, it is essential for governments, international organizations, and development agencies to collaborate and adapt strategies continually. Redirecting resources and addressing the formidable challenges encountered in the eradication of poverty requires collective action. Slovak Aid remains committed to actively engaging in global initiatives, supporting cutting-edge solutions, and fostering inclusive development, to effectively attain SDG 1 and ensure a future without poverty.
