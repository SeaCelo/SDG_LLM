Introduction

The Mennonite Central Committee (MCC) is pleased to provide this detailed analytical report on the current state of SDG 1: No Poverty. Based on our expertise and fieldwork experience, this report aims to enlighten and support an expert audience in understanding the progress, challenges, and potential strategies for achieving SDG 1.

Overview of SDG 1 and its Indicators

SDG 1 seeks to eradicate extreme poverty and reduce overall poverty rates by 2030. It acknowledges that poverty is a multidimensional issue encompassing not only income, but also access to basic services, education, healthcare, and social protection. For the purpose of monitoring, SDG 1 is measured through four indicators: (1) the proportion of people living in extreme poverty, (2) the proportion of people living below the national poverty line, (3) the coverage of social protection systems, and (4) the percentage of people suffering from food insecurity.

Progress in Achieving SDG 1

Since the adoption of the SDGs in 2015, significant progress has been made towards eliminating extreme poverty globally. The percentage of people living in extreme poverty fell from 10% in 2015 to around 8.5% in 2020, measured using the international poverty line of $1.90 per day. This decline is largely attributed to poverty reduction efforts in East Asia and the Pacific, with China's success contributing significantly.

However, progress has been uneven across regions and still insufficient to meet the 2030 target. Sub-Saharan Africa, in particular, remains a region of concern, with high poverty rates and slow progress. As of 2020, more than 40% of the population in this region lived below the international poverty line.

Challenges and Persistent Factors Influencing Poverty

The eradication of poverty is a complex task, facing numerous challenges. One critical challenge is the persistence of structural inequalities, such as unequal access to resources, including land, education, and employment opportunities. Discrimination based on gender, ethnicity, disability, and other factors exacerbates poverty by excluding certain groups from economic, social, and political life.

Another key challenge is the vulnerability to external shocks and frequent natural disasters. These events disproportionately affect impoverished communities by causing disruptions to livelihoods, resources, and exacerbating their existing struggle to escape poverty.

Furthermore, issues related to climate change further compound poverty by threatening agricultural productivity, displacing communities, and raising the costs of basic necessities like food and energy.

Strategies for Addressing SDG 1

To effectively address SDG 1, a comprehensive approach is necessary that integrates social, economic, and environmental dimensions into poverty reduction strategies. The following strategies could serve as valuable steppingstones towards achieving the SDG:

1. Strengthen Social Protection Systems: Investing in robust social protection systems is crucial for reducing poverty. This includes expanding access to quality education, healthcare, nutrition, and social safety nets to cushion vulnerable individuals and communities. Targeted cash transfer programs, universal health coverage, and special assistance for the most marginalized can provide immediate relief and enable individuals to build resilience.

2. Promote Inclusive and Sustainable Economic Growth: Prioritizing investments in productive sectors, particularly agriculture, provides a pathway out of poverty. Enhancing access to finance, knowledge, and technology can empower smallholder farmers, promote rural development, and create decent jobs, particularly for youth and women. Social enterprise models and responsible business practices that prioritize environmental and social impacts can also contribute to poverty reduction.

3. Address Structural Inequalities: Recognizing and addressing the root causes of poverty necessitates efforts to eliminate discrimination, promote inclusive governance structures, and enact policies that guarantee equal access to land, inheritance, education, and employment. Empowering women, Indigenous communities, and marginalized groups through education, vocational training, and inclusive decision-making processes are central to reducing poverty.

4. Strengthen Disaster Risk Management and Climate Adaptation: Enhancing resilience to natural disasters and climate change-associated events is crucial. Investing in climate-smart agriculture, early warning systems, and sustainable infrastructure can improve community capacities to cope with shocks, safeguard livelihoods, and uplift vulnerable populations disproportionately affected by climate impacts.

Conclusion

As experts committed to achieving sustainable development, it is imperative that we reflect on the achievements and challenges of SDG 1. While progress has been made in eradicating extreme poverty, persistent inequalities and multifaceted challenges call for further action. By implementing innovative strategies targeting social protection, inclusive economic growth, addressing structural inequalities, and prioritizing disaster risk reduction and climate adaptation measures, we can strive towards fulfilling SDG 1's vision of no poverty. Collectively, with shared responsibility and synergy, we can bring tangible and lasting change to the lives of those trapped in poverty's grasp.
