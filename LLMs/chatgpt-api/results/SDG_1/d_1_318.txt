Introduction:
Egypt has made significant progress in reducing poverty over the past few decades, yet the challenge persists. In alignment with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Egyptian Agency for Partnership for Development commissioned a comprehensive analytical report to evaluate the current status of SDG 1: No Poverty in Egypt. This report targets experts in sustainable development, policymakers, and stakeholders working closely on poverty eradication efforts. By examining various dimensions of poverty in Egypt, this report provides an in-depth analysis of the current situation and offers recommendations to accelerate progress towards achieving SDG 1.

Overview of SDG 1 in Egypt:
Despite the ongoing efforts to combat poverty in Egypt, a significant proportion of the population still lives below the poverty line. Between 2000 and 2015, the poverty rate halved from 22% to 11.8%. The COVID-19 pandemic, however, halted this progress, increasing the poverty rate to around 32% by the end of 2020. As of now, approximately 30 million Egyptians are living in poverty, facing various challenges such as limited access to basic services, low income, inadequate healthcare, and limited educational opportunities.

Multidimensional Poverty Matrix:
To better understand the complexities of poverty in Egypt, a multidimensional poverty matrix is essential. This matrix considers a range of factors beyond income, including education, health, housing conditions, access to clean water and sanitation, social protection, and gender inequality. According to the latest data, the following dimensions contribute significantly to multidimensional poverty in Egypt:

1. Lack of access to quality education: An estimated 25% of Egyptians are illiterate, hampering their ability to secure employment or access higher-paying job opportunities. Furthermore, there is a significant disparity in educational outcomes based on socioeconomic status, gender, and geographical location.

2. Inadequate healthcare services: Egypt's healthcare system struggles to provide universal access to quality healthcare services. Limited healthcare infrastructure, the high cost of healthcare, and regional imbalances in healthcare provisions contribute to the poverty-health cycle.

3. Insufficient access to basic services: Many Egyptians lack access to clean drinking water, sanitation facilities, and electricity. Access to basic services varies across rural and urban areas, further exacerbating urban-rural inequality.

Policies and Interventions:
Various policies and interventions have been implemented to reduce poverty levels and improve people's well-being. Key initiatives include:

1. Takaful and Karama program: Launched in 2015, this social welfare program provides cash transfers to those who are unable to work, ensuring a minimum level of income for vulnerable individuals and their families.

2. Social pension program: In order to alleviate elderly poverty, the government introduced a social pension program targeting vulnerable older adults, providing them with a monthly stipend.

3. Health insurance reforms: Generated through piloting programs such as the "100 Million Health Initiative" and supported with funding partnerships, the government aims to provide universal health insurance coverage to all Egyptians.

Challenges and Opportunities:
Despite the efforts made towards poverty reduction, Egypt continues to face several challenges that hamper progress towards achieving SDG 1. These challenges include:

1. Population growth: Rapid population growth poses a major challenge for poverty eradication efforts, as it places additional strain on limited resources, infrastructure, and social services.

2. Informal Economy: More than 30% of Egyptians work in the informal sector, characterized by unstable employment, low wages, and a lack of social protection. Integrating informal workers into formal employment and promoting job creation in sustainable sectors is crucial.

3. Gender inequality: Gender disparities persist in terms of labor force participation, access to education, decision-making power, and social protection. Empowering women and promoting gender equality is fundamental for poverty reduction.

Recommendations:
To accelerate progress towards SDG 1 in Egypt, the following recommendations are proposed:

1. Enhanced social protection programs: Strengthening and expanding existing social protection programs is essential to ensure income security and access to essential services for all vulnerable individuals, including women, children, older adults, and individuals with disabilities.

2. Investment in education and skill development: Prioritize investments in inclusive, quality education, particularly in vulnerable regions. Develop vocational training programs that align with market needs, fostering employment opportunities for youth.

3. Promoting sustainable and inclusive economic growth: Encourage private sector involvement in poverty reduction efforts through investment in sustainable sectors, job creation, and income generation. Focus on promoting equitable regional development and rural-urban integration.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, Egypt has made commendable efforts to reduce poverty, aligning with SDG 1. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for comprehensive poverty eradication strategies that address multidimensional poverty. By implementing the recommended interventions and policies, Egypt can accelerate progress towards achieving SDG 1, thus working towards a more equitable and prosperous future, leaving no one behind.
