SDG 1: No Poverty

Analytical Report by BRAC

Introduction
In pursuance of global efforts to eradicate poverty, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were established, encompassing a wide range of development targets. This analytical report by BRAC aims to provide an in-depth assessment of SDG 1: No Poverty, highlighting key challenges, progress, and strategies for achieving this goal. Targeting an expert audience, this report will explore the current status of poverty reduction, its impact on marginalized communities, and the approaches employed by BRAC to tackle poverty eradication.

Current Status of Poverty Reduction
While significant progress has been made, poverty remains a persistent issue globally. According to recent data from the World Bank, about 9.2% of the global population—equivalent to approximately 689 million people—still live in extreme poverty, surviving on less than $1.90 a day. This alarming statistic underscores the urgent need for coordinated efforts to eliminate poverty in all its dimensions.

Poverty and Marginalized Communities
It is crucial to recognize the disproportionate impact of poverty on marginalized communities, such as women, children, persons with disabilities, and ethnic minorities. Unequal gender norms, limited access to education and healthcare, and social exclusion exacerbate poverty among these groups, perpetuating cycles of deprivation and inequality.

Challenges in Achieving SDG 1
Several multifaceted challenges hinder the eradication of poverty. Structural barriers, such as lack of employment opportunities, inadequate social protection systems, and inequality in wealth distribution, contribute to its persistence. Additionally, conflict and climate change exacerbate poverty by disrupting livelihoods and exacerbating vulnerabilities. Addressing these challenges requires a holistic and targeted approach that tackles the root causes of poverty.

Approaches and Strategies by BRAC
As one of the world's leading development organizations, BRAC has been at the forefront in addressing poverty through innovative approaches. Our overarching strategy centers on empowering the poor to reach their full potential and empowering marginalized communities through a multi-sectoral approach. Specifically, BRAC adopts the following strategies:

1. Livelihood Development: BRAC empowers the poor by providing livelihood training, access to microfinance, and market linkages. This approach enables individuals to generate sustainable income and break free from the grip of poverty while fostering entrepreneurial skills and self-reliance within marginalized groups.

2. Social Protection: BRAC recognizes the importance of social safety nets in poverty eradication, promoting intra-familial and community support. We work closely with governments, NGOs, and international partners to strengthen social protection programs and ensure their accessibility to those most in need.

3. Education and Skill Building: Education is a fundamental tool in addressing poverty. BRAC focuses on ensuring quality education for marginalized children, especially girls, and equips youth with relevant technical and vocational skills to enhance employability and break generational cycles of poverty.

4. Health and Nutrition: BRAC places special emphasis on healthcare provision, maternal and child health, nutrition, and sanitation services. By addressing health-related challenges faced by the poor, we contribute to poverty reduction by improving overall well-being and productivity.

5. Advocacy and Policy Influence: BRAC works closely with governments, multilateral organizations, and other stakeholders to influence policy decisions in favor of poverty eradication. Our evidence-based advocacy initiatives help ensure a supportive enabling environment for sustainable poverty reduction.

Conclusion
SDG 1 remains a critical priority for the global community, necessitating comprehensive actions and strategies to eliminate poverty in all its forms. As highlighted in this analytical report, poverty disproportionately affects marginalized communities and requires a multidimensional approach. BRAC stands committed to its mission of creating a just and poverty-free world, actively implementing strategies that empower the poor, advocating for inclusive policies, and striving towards the ambitious goal of No Poverty.
