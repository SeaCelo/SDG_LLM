Abstract:
This academic article aims to critically analyze the Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1), which is focused on eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions. The literature review evaluates key policy measures, challenges, and successes in addressing poverty, while exploring various aspects of inequality and identifying strategies for poverty eradication. An in-depth examination of different regions and countries reveals disparities in progress towards achieving SDG 1. Overall, this article provides valuable insights into the complex nature of poverty eradication and serves as a framework for policymakers and scholars to understand the effective implementation of SDG 1.

Introduction:
Poverty alleviation is an essential pillar of sustainable development. SDG 1, also known as "No Poverty," outlines an ambitious agenda that strives to end extreme poverty, reduce poverty rates, and ensure social protection systems for the vulnerable populations by 2030. This academic article dives deep into SDG 1, assessing both global and country-specific progress, challenges, and strategies.

Literature Review:
Numerous studies indicate the multidimensional nature of poverty, which necessitates comprehensive policies and interventions to tackle its diverse causes and manifestations. The literature review reveals a shift in poverty discourse from income-centric to a multi-dimensional approach, emphasizing education, health, gender equality, and access to basic services.

Policy Measures:
To effectively address poverty, governments need to design and implement targeted policy measures. One widely recognized policy tool is conditional cash transfers (CCTs), which provide cash assistance to low-income households, accompanied by certain conditions such as sending children to school or regular health check-ups. CCTs have been successful in a number of countries, as they simultaneously alleviate poverty and promote investment in human capital.

Social protection systems are crucial for ensuring resilient communities and protecting individuals from various shocks such as economic downturns or natural disasters. Countries like Brazil, with its Bolsa Fam√≠lia program, have demonstrated how an efficient social protection system can reduce poverty rates and inequality while empowering the most vulnerable segments of society.

Inequality:
Inequality remains a significant obstacle to achieving SDG 1. The concentration of wealth and income disparities within and between countries exacerbates poverty and limits opportunities for marginalized populations. Policy interventions should address the root causes of inequality, ensuring equitable access to education, healthcare, financial services, and other opportunities.

Case Studies:
Analyzing progress indicators from various regions and countries allows for a better understanding of the challenges and successes in poverty eradication efforts. For instance, Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant poverty challenges due to issues such as conflict, political instability, and limited access to basic services. However, consistent efforts in improving agricultural productivity, access to primary education, and healthcare services have shown promising results.

In contrast, countries like China and India have made significant progress in reducing poverty thanks to sustained economic growth and targeted poverty reduction programs. By implementing policies that promote inclusive growth, these countries have managed to lift millions out of poverty within a relatively short span of time.

Conclusion:
The Sustainable Development Goal 1, focused on eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, is a lighthouse for addressing one of the most pressing challenges faced by humanity. This article highlights the complex nature of poverty eradication, underlining the need for multi-dimensional approaches, targeted policies, and robust social protection systems. The analysis of various case studies demonstrates the importance of context-specific interventions and the central role of equity in reducing poverty. Ultimately, by leveraging the lessons learned from these experiences, policymakers and scholars can guide their efforts and contribute to the attainment of SDG 1.
