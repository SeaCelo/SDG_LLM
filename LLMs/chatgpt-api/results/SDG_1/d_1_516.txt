Title: Progress and Challenges in Achieving Sustainable Development Goal 1: No Poverty

Abstract:
This article explores the progress and challenges in achieving Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1) - No Poverty. Adopted by the United Nations in 2015, SDG 1 aims to eradicate extreme poverty, reduce overall poverty rates, and ensure social protection for vulnerable populations. Utilizing the framework of applied econometrics, this study provides an overview of the progress made towards SDG 1, assesses the key determinants of poverty, identifies policy interventions, and highlights the critical challenges that need to be addressed to eradicate poverty by 2030.

Introduction:
Poverty continues to be a global challenge with dynamic manifestations across distinct countries, regions, and communities. SDG 1 recognizes poverty as a multidimensional issue and aims to integrate economic growth, social protection, and inclusion to eliminate extreme poverty. This article investigates the progress made towards SDG 1 through the lens of applied econometrics, recognizing the need for rigorous empirical analysis to understand the drivers and consequences of poverty.

Overview of Progress:
Recent data suggests that progress has been made in reducing extreme poverty globally. The proportion of people living below the international poverty line has been declining over the past few decades. This decline can be attributed to sustained economic growth, improved access to education and healthcare, advancements in technology, and targeted policies aimed at poverty reduction. However, regional disparities persist, with sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia accounting for the majority of the poverty burden.

Key Determinants of Poverty:
Applied econometric analyses have identified several crucial determinants of poverty, highlighting the complexity of its causes. Income inequality, governance failures, lack of economic opportunities, inadequate access to basic services, and social discrimination are among the key factors that perpetuate poverty. Additionally, intergenerational transmission of poverty, gender disparities, and environmental degradation act as underlying catalysts for poverty persistence.

Policy Interventions:
In the pursuit of SDG 1, policymakers need to employ evidence-based strategies to effectively combat poverty. Policies that promote inclusive economic growth and job creation, enhance access to quality education and healthcare, build resilient social protection systems, and address systemic inequalities are pivotal in poverty eradication efforts. Empirical evidence has shown that conditional cash transfers, microfinance initiatives, progressive taxation policies, and investments in infrastructure can significantly alleviate poverty.

Challenges Ahead:
The achievement of SDG 1 faces substantial challenges that warrant attention. Rapid urbanization, climate change, conflict, macroeconomic instability, and lack of access to financial services pose significant impediments to poverty eradication efforts. Furthermore, the uneven advancement of the digital economy risks exacerbating inequalities, making it crucial to ensure equitable access to opportunities and resources.

Conclusion:
While progress has been made in reducing poverty globally, significant disparities persist, necessitating further action. Applying applied econometric methodologies has shed light on the complex determinants of poverty, enabling policymakers to design evidence-based interventions. Addressing the underlying causes of poverty, promoting equitable and sustainable economic growth, investing in social welfare programs, empowering vulnerable populations, and fostering international cooperation are essential to achieve SDG 1. Only through collaborative efforts and evidence-based policymaking can we develop targeted solutions and eliminate poverty, thus promoting sustainable and inclusive development.
