Since its adoption in 2015, Sustainable Development Goal 1 aims to eradicate extreme poverty in all its forms and ensure that no one is left behind. This analytical report, commissioned by the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) and targeting an expert audience, investigates the progress and challenges related to SDG 1, with a particular emphasis on the least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs).

1. Introduction:
This report begins by highlighting the overarching objective of SDG 1, which is to achieve sustainable and inclusive economic growth, social development, and environmental protection for the most vulnerable populations. It stresses the fundamental need to address poverty as the fundamental root cause of inequality and lack of access to basic necessities in LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs.

2. Progress and Achievements:
The report highlights the significant efforts made by many LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs in tackling extreme poverty and improving the lives of their most marginalized populations. It focuses on the substantial progress in reducing poverty rates, increasing access to basic education, promoting gender equality, enhancing social protection mechanisms, and providing job opportunities through innovative approaches in these nations. Specific examples and success stories are included to illustrate successful strategies employed by different countries within this category.

3. Challenges and Bottlenecks:
The report, however, acknowledges ongoing challenges and bottlenecks that impede progress towards SDG 1. It addresses the structural constraints faced by LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs, such as limited access to financial resources, vulnerability to climate change, insufficient integration into global trade, and underdeveloped infrastructure. It underlines that these challenges disproportionately affect the most vulnerable groups, including women, children, persons with disabilities, and marginalized communities.

4. Policy Recommendations:
To overcome the challenges and accelerate progress towards SDG 1, the report puts forward a set of targeted policy recommendations. It emphasizes the importance of strengthening domestic resource mobilization, enhancing international cooperation, promoting inclusive finance systems, and improving trade facilitation and regional integration. The report also emphasizes the need to develop and implement tailored poverty eradication strategies that address the unique circumstances of LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs.

5. Role of International Organizations:
The report underscores the crucial role of international organizations, particularly the United Nations, in supporting LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs in their efforts towards achieving SDG 1. It calls for increased funding commitments, knowledge sharing, technology transfer, capacity building, and policy coherence from the international community. The report highlights the importance of mainstreaming the principle of leaving no one behind in all development programs and policies.

6. Conclusion:
The report concludes by reiterating the significance of SDG 1 in eradicating extreme poverty and promoting inclusivity in LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs. It emphasizes on the need for sustained efforts and innovative approaches to address the multifaceted challenges faced by these countries. The report emphasizes that the achievement of SDG 1 will not only improve livelihoods but also contribute to the overall sustainable development of these nations and the global community at large.

By shining a spotlight on the progress, challenges, and recommendations for SDG 1 in LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs, this analytical report aims to inform key stakeholders, policy-makers, and experts on the interventions needed to address poverty eradication effectively. It provides valuable insights and best practices to guide policymakers in making informed decisions and to spur collective actions in furthering the objectives of SDG 1 in these specific groups of countries.
