Analytical Report on SDG 1: No Poverty
by Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation ACP-EU

Introduction
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted by UN member states in 2015 to address various global challenges and create a sustainable and inclusive future for all. SDG 1, "No Poverty," holds significant importance as it focuses on eradicating extreme poverty and reducing poverty in all its dimensions globally. This report aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the current status, key challenges, and potential solutions pertaining to SDG 1.

Current Status and Challenges
The current status of global poverty is mixed. Significant progress has been made over the past few years, with the global poverty rate decreasing from 36% in 1990 to 10% in 2015. However, approximately 700 million people still live in extreme poverty, where they struggle to meet their basic needs such as food, water, sanitation, and decent shelter.

One of the primary challenges in tackling global poverty is its multidimensional nature. Poverty is not merely a lack of income; it encompasses a combination of factors such as limited access to education, healthcare, social protection, and employment opportunities. Additionally, poverty often disproportionately affects vulnerable groups, such as women, children, ethnic minorities, and individuals living in rural areas.

Another critical challenge is the regional disparity in poverty distribution. While progress has been made in reducing poverty in Eastern Asia and Southeastern Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region with the highest poverty rates. Conflict-affected areas also face added challenges in poverty reduction, as resources and infrastructure are often disrupted.

Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated global poverty levels. The economic contraction and increased unemployment rates led to a rise in poverty rates worldwide. The pandemic's impact on various socio-economic factors, including education, health, and income distribution, has widened existing inequalities and hindered poverty eradication efforts.

Potential Solutions and Strategies
Addressing SDG 1 requires a comprehensive and integrated approach that aims to tackle the root causes of poverty, improve living conditions, and promote sustainable livelihoods. The following strategies offer potential solutions to accomplish these goals:

1. Social Protection and Safety Nets: Strengthening social protection policies and safety nets is vital in reducing poverty. Governments must prioritize providing adequate social assistance and welfare systems to protect vulnerable populations from falling into extreme poverty.

2. Inclusive Economic Growth: Foster economic growth that benefits all, especially marginalized groups. Policies that create employment opportunities, enhance skills training, and support entrepreneurship can help lift individuals out of poverty.

3. Rural Development: Promote agricultural and rural development to alleviate poverty in rural areas, where a significant proportion of the global poor resides. Investment in infrastructure, access to credit, and agricultural support services can improve productivity, income, and food security.

4. Education and Health: Improving access to quality education and healthcare services is essential for breaking the poverty cycle. This entails investing in school infrastructure, teacher training, and health facilities, particularly in remote and disadvantaged areas.

5. Addressing Gender Inequality: Gender inequality is closely linked to poverty. Empowering women through increased access to education, healthcare, land ownership, and economic opportunities is crucial for poverty reduction.

Conclusion
Despite challenges, progress, and innovative strategies offer hope for achieving SDG 1: No Poverty. Collaboration and commitment from governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector are essential to address the multidimensional nature of poverty and ensure inclusivity. Combining well-targeted policies, investments in key sectors, and sustainable development practices can contribute towards a poverty-free world as envisioned by SDG 1. The collective efforts of all stakeholders can pave the way for a more equitable and just future for all individuals, regardless of their economic status.
