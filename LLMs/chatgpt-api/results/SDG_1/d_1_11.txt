Report on Sustainable Development Goal 1: No Poverty

Introduction:

This report aims to provide a detailed analysis of Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1): No Poverty. It examines the current state of poverty, its impact, and the efforts being made towards eradicating poverty globally. The report highlights key global trends, regional disparities, and strategies that can potentially address this pressing issue. This analytical report is produced by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) and is intended for an expert audience concerned with poverty eradication and sustainable development.

Overview of SDG 1:

SDG 1 focuses on eradicating extreme poverty and reducing poverty in all its forms everywhere. The Agenda 2030 recognizes that poverty is more than the lack of income, as it includes access to basic necessities like food, education, healthcare, and social protection.

Global Trends in Poverty:

Despite significant progress made over the past few decades, the global trends in poverty reduction are mixed. According to recent data, the proportion of people living in extreme poverty decreased from 36% in 1990 to 10% in 2015. However, the reduction has been unevenly distributed, with Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia accounting for a substantial portion of the remaining population living in extreme poverty.

Interlinkages with Social Development:

Poverty is a multidimensional issue and is interconnected with other social issues. Progress in reducing poverty heavily relies on addressing inequality, promoting social inclusion, ensuring access to quality education, healthcare, and clean water and sanitation. Targeting the root causes of poverty also requires considering gender disparities, environmental sustainability, and inclusive economic growth.

Measuring Poverty:

Understanding and measuring poverty is crucial for informed policy-making and decision-making. Monetary measures, such as the international poverty line (set at $1.90 per day), provide a basic threshold; however, a more comprehensive approach includes multidimensional indicators that encompass various human rights and well-being dimensions. The use of supplementary measures, such as the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), enables a contextual understanding of poverty and supports targeted interventions.

Regional Disparities:

The issue of poverty exhibits significant regional disparities. Latin America and the Caribbean region is home to both extreme wealth and extensive poverty. While the region has made substantial progress in reducing poverty rates over the past decade, it still faces challenges in deep-rooted inequality, uneven distribution of wealth, and social exclusion. The persistence of poverty in rural areas, indigenous populations, Afro-descendants, and women requires targeted interventions and social policies that promote inclusiveness and equitable growth.

Strategies for Eradicating Poverty:

Successful poverty eradication requires a combination of policies and strategies that address the structural drivers of poverty. Some effective strategies include:

1. Social Protection Systems: Expanding and strengthening social protection measures, such as conditional cash transfers, unemployment benefits, and inclusive healthcare systems, can provide a safety net for the most vulnerable populations. These systems need to be integrated, sustainable, and offer access to quality services.

2. Quality Education: Investing in inclusive and quality education is essential for breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty. Access to education is a prerequisite for skill development, employment opportunities, and social mobility.

3. Inclusive Economic Growth: Promoting inclusive economic growth requires policies that create decent jobs, ensure fair wages, and enhance productivity. Targeted interventions for entrepreneurship development, especially for women and marginalized groups, can foster economic empowerment and reduce poverty.

4. Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Development: Addressing poverty in rural areas necessitates investments in sustainable agriculture, land reforms, rural infrastructure, and access to markets. Empowering small-scale farmers and promoting environmentally friendly practices can enhance food security and economic opportunities in rural areas.

Conclusion:

The journey towards eradicating poverty remains a complex and multidimensional challenge. Understanding the heterogeneity of poverty experiences, regional disparities, and the interconnectedness with broader social development goals is crucial for formulating effective policies and interventions. This report provides an overview of SDG 1 and highlights the current state of poverty, global trends, regional disparities, and strategies for eradicating poverty. Collaborative efforts, sound policies, and data-driven interventions are necessary to achieve the target of No Poverty by 2030. ECLAC reaffirms its commitment to supporting member states in their endeavors to eradicate poverty and foster sustainable development.
