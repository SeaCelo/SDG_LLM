In recent decades, increasing attention has been given to tackling the prevailing issue of poverty around the world. The need for a comprehensive approach to alleviate poverty and ensure prosperity for all has led to the formulation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), an ambitious and transformative agenda set by the United Nations. Among the seventeen goals outlined in the SDGs, Goal 1 – "No Poverty" – holds a central position, recognizing poverty as a pervasive challenge that hampers sustainable development globally.

As a Nobel laureate in Economics and a renowned expert in finance and economics, I, Robert C. Merton, have dedicated significant portions of my research to studying the impact and causes of poverty. When examining the SDG 1, it is imperative to acknowledge that eradicating poverty is about more than just increasing income levels. It requires an integrated and multifaceted approach that addresses the structural issues, inequalities, and lack of access to basic resources faced by the impoverished.

The primary target set in SDG 1 is to reduce extreme poverty worldwide, defined as living on less than $1.90 per day. While this is an essential focus, it is important to recognize that poverty is a nuanced phenomenon, with various dimensions that extend beyond income alone. To address poverty comprehensively, it is crucial to consider other indicators such as access to basic services like education, healthcare, clean water, sanitation, and housing. Only by taking a holistic approach can we ensure sustainable progress in addressing poverty-related issues.

One crucial aspect of poverty eradication is providing access to quality education. Education can be an instrumental tool that empowers individuals, equipping them with the necessary skills to improve their livelihoods and break out of the intergenerational cycle of poverty. By investing in inclusive and equitable education systems, SDG 1 aims to ensure that children, regardless of their socio-economic backgrounds, have access to quality education. This, in turn, prepares future generations to contribute actively to their communities, fostering social and economic development.

Healthcare is another critical component for addressing poverty. When individuals are burdened by healthcare costs or lack access to essential services, they experience a downward spiral of economic instability. SDG 1 aims to ensure that everyone has access to affordable, quality healthcare, thus safeguarding them from falling even deeper into poverty due to healthcare-related expenses. By providing adequate healthcare coverage and investing in healthcare infrastructure in underserved regions, the SDGs strive to break the vicious circle between health and poverty.

Moreover, addressing gender inequality and empowering women is an essential element in tackling poverty. Globally, women and girls face disproportionate levels of poverty due to limited economic opportunities, social norms, and unequal access to resources and education. SDG 1 specifically emphasizes the need to uplift women economically by providing equal rights, access to financial services, and opportunities for productive employment. By empowering women, we create a more inclusive society that thrives on diversity and collaboration.

To achieve the ambitious targets set by SDG 1, it is critical to enhance collaboration at all levels. The eradication of poverty necessitates concerted efforts from governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), private sector entities, and communities themselves. Innovative financing mechanisms, investment in infrastructure, and inclusive policies must be deployed to ensure a sustainable and comprehensive approach.

While progress has been made over the years in reducing poverty rates, challenges remain. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing inequalities and pushed millions into extreme poverty, threatening to reverse the gains achieved thus far. Consequently, it is imperative that governments and international organizations reinvigorate their commitment to SDG 1, ensuring the ambitious targets continue to guide global efforts.

In conclusion, the Sustainable Development Goal 1 – "No Poverty" – lies at the heart of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, recognizing the multi-dimensional nature of poverty and the need for comprehensive approaches. Through investments in education, healthcare, gender equality, and collaborative efforts, we can pave the way for sustainable development and a world free from poverty. As researchers, policymakers, and change agents, it is our collective responsibility to prioritize SDG 1, ensuring a more just and prosperous future for all."
