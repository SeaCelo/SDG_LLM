Introduction
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations in 2015 form a comprehensive framework to address the world's most pressing challenges. Each goal focuses on distinct targets and indicators, with SDG 1 aiming to end poverty in all its forms and dimensions. This report, written by the Agência Brasileira de Cooperação (ABC), delves into an analytical assessment of the progress made towards achieving SDG 1 and explores the specific actions and strategies Brazil has implemented to eradicate poverty.

Overview of SDG 1
SDG 1 is centered on the elimination of poverty, which encompasses both monetary and multidimensional dimensions. Its core target aims to halve the proportion of people living in poverty according to national definitions by 2030. Additionally, it highlights the importance of social protection systems, access to basic services, and ensuring equal rights and opportunities for all.

Poverty in Brazil: Current Status
In Brazil, poverty and inequality have been persistent challenges, although significant progress has been achieved over the years. The World Bank classifies Brazil as an upper-middle-income country, but it still grapples with substantial income disparities and a high Gini coefficient. Data shows that poverty rates have decreased in recent years, yet socioeconomic inequalities persist, especially affecting marginalized communities.

Government Strategies and Initiatives
The Brazilian government has taken various measures to combat poverty and achieve SDG 1. Some of the key strategies and initiatives include:

1. Bolsa Família: Brazil's flagship social welfare program, Bolsa Família, provides conditional cash transfers to low-income families. This initiative has effectively reduced poverty and malnutrition, improved school attendance, and empowered women, contributing to the overall goal of poverty reduction.

2. National Social Assistance System (Sistema Único de Assistência Social - SUAS): SUAS is an integrated system that ensures social protection and assistance to vulnerable populations. It provides diverse services such as financial aid, healthcare, and professional training to help lift people out of poverty and increase social inclusion.

3. Zero Hunger Program (Programa Fome Zero): This program aims to ensure access to sufficient and nutritious food for all Brazilians. By promoting food security and supporting family farming, the Zero Hunger Program directly addresses one of the root causes of poverty.

4. Expansion of Basic Services: The Brazilian government has prioritized the expansion of basic services such as education, healthcare, and sanitation in low-income areas. This approach aims to bridge the social and spatial gaps, breaking the cycles of poverty and improving the quality of life of vulnerable populations.

Obstacles and Challenges
While progress has been made, Brazil continues to face obstacles in fully eradicating poverty. Limited fiscal resources, political instability, and regional disparities complicate the implementation of programs targeting poverty reduction. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated inequalities, leading to setbacks in poverty eradication efforts.

Recommendations and Conclusion
To further advance the attainment of SDG 1, continued efforts are needed. The ABC recommends the following:

1. Strengthening of Social Protection Systems: Continued investment in social protection programs and systems can ensure a comprehensive safety net for vulnerable populations, empowering them to break the poverty cycle.

2. Addressing Regional Inequalities: Targeted policies addressing regional disparities will help bridge the gap between prosperous urban areas and marginalized rural communities, promoting more equitable development.

3. Promoting Economic Opportunities: Prioritizing job creation, entrepreneurship, and vocational training can uplift communities by providing sustainable income opportunities.

4. Engaging Civil Society and Stakeholders: Collaborative efforts involving civil society, private sector, and international cooperation are essential in implementing sustainable solutions and partnerships to combat poverty effectively.

In conclusion, Brazil has made significant strides in addressing poverty and advancing SDG 1. However, the challenges of income inequality, regional disparities, and external shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic necessitate continued efforts and innovative approaches to achieve poverty eradication and ensure sustainable development for all Brazilians.
