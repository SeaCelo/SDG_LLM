Introduction

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1) â€“ "No Poverty", as per the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. As the International Organization for Migration (IOM), we strive to address poverty-related issues at the nexus of migration, recognizing the interrelationship between poverty and migration. This report presents an expert examination of the current state of SDG 1, highlighting its key targets, associated challenges, accomplishments, and potential areas for improvement.

Background

SDG 1 aims to eradicate poverty in all its forms worldwide. Access to universal basic needs, such as food, nutrition, shelter, education, and healthcare services, is pivotal to achieving this target. The fundamental principle of "leaving no one behind" underpins SDG 1, as it seeks to ensure that those in vulnerable situations have equal opportunities for development and economic inclusion.

Key Targets

1.1: By 2030, end extreme poverty for all people living below the international poverty line, currently defined as $1.90 per day.
1.2: By 2030, reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women, and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions
1.3: Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable

Challenges

Despite various advancements, several challenges impede the achievement of SDG 1. Fragmented statistical data, limited funding, inadequate policy frameworks, social inequalities, conflict, and climate change disparities substantially affect poverty eradication efforts.

Accomplishments

Numerous commendable achievements have been observed in the pursuit of SDG 1. Across various countries, significant reductions in extreme poverty have been recorded, thereby uplifting countless individuals from the clutches of deprivation. Social protection systems have also been established in multiple nations, ensuring adequate coverage for the most vulnerable. Increased international cooperation, knowledge sharing, and targeted policy interventions fostered positive socio-economic development, thus contributing to poverty eradication.

Areas for Improvement

1. Data Harmonization: Enhanced collaboration among national statistical agencies is needed to improve data collection methods, accuracy, and comparability. Regular surveys, comprehensive databases, and timely reporting are crucial for informed policy-making and effective poverty eradication strategies.

2. Equity-Centered Approach: While progress has been made, marginalized and vulnerable groups, including migrant populations, still face disproportionate risks of falling into poverty. An equity-centered approach in policy design, implementation, and evaluation is imperative for promoting inclusive economic growth.

3. Enhanced Financial Support: Increased financial resources, both domestic and international, are required to accelerate poverty reduction efforts. Innovative funding mechanisms and partnerships between various stakeholders, including governments, private sector entities, and NGOs, should be explored to bridge the persistent resource gap and ensure long-term sustainability.

4. Sustainable Livelihoods and Migration: Recognize the crucial role of migration in poverty alleviation by addressing the root causes of forced migration, improving labor migration governance, and promoting pathways for regular and safe migration. Equitable and favorable migration policies, backed by improved capacities and collaboration between countries, can maximize the positive impact of migration on poverty eradication.

Conclusion

SDG 1 serves as a fundamental building block for sustainable development, with the vision of leaving no one behind. The joint effort of governments, international organizations, civil society, and other stakeholders is instrumental in tackling poverty-related challenges. As the International Organization for Migration, we remain committed to playing an active role in the implementation of SDG 1 and striving to achieve a world where poverty becomes nothing more than a distant memory.
