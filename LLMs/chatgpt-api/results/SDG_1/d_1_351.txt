Introduction:
Thailand International Cooperation Agency (TICA) presents this detailed analytical report on the current state of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1: No Poverty. The purpose of this report is to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the progress made by Thailand in achieving SDG 1, analyze the challenges faced, identify areas for improvement, and propose recommendations.

Current Situation:
Thailand has made significant strides in reducing poverty over the past few decades. According to the World Bank, the poverty rate in Thailand has declined from 65.26% in 1988 to 9.85% in 2018. This achievement reflects the country's commitment to poverty eradication and inclusive growth.

Progress and Achievements:
Thailand's effort in poverty reduction can be attributed to a combination of initiatives focused on economic development, social protection, and targeted interventions. The government has implemented pro-poor policies, such as the National Social and Economic Development Plan, which aim to uplift disadvantaged communities and improve income distribution.

One particularly successful program is the Village Fund, introduced in 2001, which provides microcredit to the rural poor. This initiative has empowered grassroots entrepreneurs and improved livelihoods, leading to a reduction in poverty and increased income generation.

Moreover, the government's commitment to achieving universal health coverage has played a vital role in improving the well-being of the population. The introduction of the Universal Coverage Scheme in 2002 has ensured access to healthcare for all Thai citizens, contributing to poverty reduction by reducing out-of-pocket health expenditures.

Challenges and Obstacles:
While Thailand has made significant progress in poverty reduction, there are still challenges to overcome. One major obstacle is the disparity in the poverty rate between urban and rural areas. Poverty remains more prevalent in rural communities, particularly in the north and northeast regions of the country.

This geographic disparity highlights the need for targeted policies and development interventions to bridge the urban-rural divide and ensure that no one is left behind. Access to quality education, healthcare, infrastructure, and market opportunities in rural areas must be improved to address these underlying inequalities.

Furthermore, vulnerable and marginalized groups, including ethnic minorities, migrants, and persons with disabilities, continue to face a higher risk of poverty. Addressing the specific needs of these groups and ensuring their inclusion in development processes is essential for the achievement of SDG 1.

Recommendations:
To further advance progress towards SDG 1, Thailand should consider the following recommendations:

1. Strengthening Social Protection: Expanding social protection programs and ensuring their efficient delivery to target vulnerable populations. This includes enhancing cash transfer schemes, education and health subsidies, and social security coverage for informal workers.

2. Enhancing Access to Education and Skills Development: Investing in quality education and vocational training programs in rural areas to promote human capital development. Equipping individuals with relevant skills is crucial for poverty reduction and empowering individuals to access better economic opportunities.

3. Promoting Sustainable Livelihoods: Supporting small-scale farmers and promoting sustainable agriculture practices to improve the resilience of rural communities. This includes providing access to finance, technical assistance, and market linkages for agricultural producers.

4. Strengthening Data and Monitoring Mechanisms: Enhancing data collection and analysis on poverty and inequality to better understand the specific needs and trends. This will aid in evidence-based policymaking and ensuring that interventions are targeted effectively.

Conclusion:
Thailand has made significant strides in poverty reduction, but challenges remain. Through a combination of continued commitment, targeted policies, and inclusive approaches, Thailand can further advance its progress in SDG 1. By addressing geographical disparities, supporting vulnerable populations, and promoting sustainable livelihoods, Thailand can create an inclusive society where no one is left behind on the path towards a poverty-free nation.
