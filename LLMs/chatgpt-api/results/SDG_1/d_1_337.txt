The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) mark a significant global commitment to addressing poverty and ensuring sustainable development in all sectors and regions by 2030. As an expert audience of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs focusing on international development programs, it is crucial to understand the progress and challenges associated with SDG 1: No Poverty.

SDG 1 aims to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030 and ensure that all people have equal rights to economic resources, basic services, land ownership, and social protection. Despite considerable progress in poverty reduction over the years, challenges such as income inequality, lack of access to basic services, violence, conflicts, and environmental degradation persist, requiring tailored strategies to address them comprehensively.

In evaluating the progress on SDG 1, it is essential to analyze regional and country-level data. Globally, extreme poverty has been declining but is still a persistent issue, particularly impacting sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia. Extreme poverty refers to the condition where individuals live on less than $1.90 per day, struggling to meet their basic needs of food, healthcare, and education.

One notable achievement in poverty reduction is access to basic services. Over the past decade, access to clean drinking water, sanitation facilities, and electricity has increased significantly in many countries. Nevertheless, the coverage of these services remains uneven, with marginalized populations and rural communities still lacking access, exacerbating poverty gaps.

Another crucial aspect of SDG 1 is the promotion of inclusive growth and decent work. This promotes economic empowerment and ensures that all individuals can benefit from sustainable economic growth. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the vulnerability of millions of people working in the informal sector and those engaged in low-paying jobs. Their livelihoods have been severely impacted, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions and social safety nets.

Conflict and violence present major hurdles to achieving SDG 1. Fragile and conflict-affected countries experience higher poverty rates, displacement, and limited access to resources and services. Approaches that focus on conflict prevention, peacebuilding, and resilience building are vital to address poverty in such contexts.

Addressing environmental degradation is key to sustainable poverty reduction. Climate change and environmental degradation disproportionately affect the poor, exacerbating their vulnerability. Strategies integrating sustainable natural resource management, climate change adaptation, and mitigation, can foster resilient economies and reduce poverty sustainably.

It is significant to recognize that achieving SDG 1 requires partnerships and collaboration. Governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector must work together to mobilize resources, share knowledge and expertise, and implement innovative solutions. South-South and triangular cooperation, focused on sharing experiences and best practices among developing countries, play a crucial role in achieving SDG 1.

To accelerate progress towards SDG 1, it is essential to strengthen policies and institutions for poverty eradication, enhance social protection systems, promote equitable access to resources and basic services, and promote gender equality and empowerment. Policymakers should prioritize poverty-reduction strategies, invest in appropriate infrastructure, and ensure inclusivity and sustainability in development plans.

Furthermore, aligning national budgets with the SDGs and investing in data collection and monitoring systems plays a critical role in tracking progress, identifying gaps, and making evidence-based policy decisions.

To conclude, SDG 1 aims to eliminate extreme poverty, promote inclusive growth, decent work, equal rights, and access to resources and services. While progress has been made, persistent challenges, such as income inequality, lack of access to basic services, conflicts, and environmental degradation, must be addressed in a comprehensive and collaborative manner to fulfill the goals of SDG 1. With an enhanced focus on sustainable development strategies and strong partnerships, we can aspire to a world where poverty is eradicated, and all individuals can live a dignified and prosperous life.
