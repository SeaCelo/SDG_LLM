The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) presents this detailed analytical report on SDG 1, focusing on the efforts made towards eliminating extreme poverty and ensuring social protection for all. The report aims to provide expert audiences with insights into the current status and progress of SDG 1 and to outline potential challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.

SDG 1, titled "No Poverty," calls for an integrated and comprehensive approach to eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions by 2030. It recognizes that poverty is a multi-dimensional issue that goes beyond income levels alone and encompasses various factors such as access to basic services, social protection systems, and economic opportunities.

In analyzing the current status of SDG 1, it is essential to acknowledge both progress achieved and existing challenges. While poverty rates have been declining globally over the past decades, inequalities in income distribution persist, posing significant barriers to achieving the overall goal. It is estimated that about 9.2% of the world's population, or approximately 700 million people, lived in extreme poverty in 2019.

Canada, as a strong supporter of the SDGs, has been actively engaged in addressing poverty and inequality both within its borders and globally. The Canadian government has demonstrated its commitment to SDG 1 through various policy measures, partnerships, and investments. These initiatives reflect the understanding that addressing poverty requires comprehensive strategies, effective social protection systems, and targeted interventions at various levels.

One significant aspect of Canada's approach to SDG 1 is its focus on social protection systems. Social protection aims to provide individuals and families with a safety net to prevent them from falling into poverty and enables them to access basic services, such as healthcare, education, and decent work opportunities. Key social protection programs in Canada include universal healthcare, unemployment insurance, and income support for vulnerable populations.

The international dimension of Canada's efforts is characterized by its robust development assistance initiatives. CIDA plays a pivotal role in supporting the SDG agenda within partner countries, particularly in poverty reduction and social protection programs. Through targeted investments and partnerships with local governments, civil society organizations, and international institutions, Canada aims to build inclusive, resilient, and sustainable communities where no one is left behind.

However, several challenges persist in achieving SDG 1 both globally and within Canada. Persistent poverty and rising inequality are exacerbated by factors such as conflicts, climate change, gender inequality, and imbalanced economic growth. In the face of these challenges, it is crucial to develop innovative and evidence-based approaches that integrate economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development.

Canada must address these challenges by strengthening domestic policies, improving access to education and skills development, promoting inclusive economic growth, and adopting effective social protection mechanisms. Internationally, Canada should continue to partner with other countries, multilateral organizations, and civil society to support poverty reduction initiatives, knowledge sharing, and capacity building.

Looking forward, the achievement of SDG 1 requires a sustained focus on poverty eradication through collaboration, innovation, and resource mobilization. Advancements in technology, such as digital inclusion, can play a particularly transformative role in reaching the most marginalized and reducing poverty levels. Resource mobilization efforts, including public and private financing for development, must prioritize investments that target the root causes of poverty and bring about transformative change.

In conclusion, Canada recognizes that ending poverty is a complex and multidimensional task that demands comprehensive, integrated, and sustainable solutions. Through its commitment to SDG 1 and its ongoing efforts to address poverty and inequality both domestically and internationally, Canada aims to contribute to a future where poverty is eradicated, social protection is accessible, and no one is left behind. However, achieving this goal will require continued collaboration, innovation, and an unwavering commitment from all stakeholders involved.
