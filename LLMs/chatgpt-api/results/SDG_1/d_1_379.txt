Despite notable progress made in reducing global poverty over the past few decades, extreme poverty remains one of the most pressing challenges faced by the international community. As stated in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the first Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 1) aims to eradicate extreme poverty in all its forms globally by 2030. This report, prepared by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), undertakes a comprehensive analysis of the current state of SDG 1, providing insights into its implementation, key achievements, challenges, and recommendations to accelerate progress.

Assessing the progress towards reaching SDG 1 requires a multi-faceted analysis, considering diverse dimensions of poverty, regional disparities, and vulnerable populations. Extreme poverty encompasses not only the lack of income and consumption but also limited access to education, healthcare, sanitation, clean water, and other basic services. It disproportionately affects children, rendering them more vulnerable to a range of challenges, including malnutrition, stunted growth, limited educational opportunities, and higher rates of mortality.

Globally, the absolute number of people living in extreme poverty has witnessed a significant decline over the past few decades. However, despite this progress, income inequality continues to rise, placing significant hurdles in eradicating extreme poverty. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these inequalities, pushing an estimated 83 to 132 million people into extreme poverty in 2020 alone. The report emphasizes the urgent need for policy intervention to address these setbacks and prevent further exacerbation of global poverty.

Regional disparities play a critical role in understanding the challenges faced in achieving SDG 1. Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region with the highest prevalence of extreme poverty, accounting for the majority of the world's poor. Within countries, impoverished rural areas often experience higher poverty rates compared to urban areas. Efforts targeted at these areas, such as enhancing rural infrastructure, agriculture productivity, and access to education and healthcare services, will be crucial in driving progress towards SDG 1.

Investing in human capital, particularly in children and young people, represents not only a vital element of SDG 1 but also a driver of sustainable development. This entails universal access to quality education, which serves as a potent tool to break the cycle of poverty by equipping young individuals with skills necessary for meaningful employment and economic empowerment. Child labor remains a significant barrier, and efforts to eliminate this practice are of paramount importance.

Furthermore, social protection programs are essential for preventing individuals and families from falling into poverty and for supporting those who are already affected by extreme poverty. Expanding and strengthening safety net programs that provide direct cash transfers, promote access to education, healthcare, and nutrition, can make a substantial impact in reducing poverty rates. The report underscores the importance of a comprehensive social protection system, tailored to the specific needs and conditions of each country.

The report highlights some commendable initiatives that have contributed to the progress made in reaching SDG 1. Countries that have successfully implemented poverty reduction strategies with a focus on pro-poor policies, inclusive growth, and social protection have seen positive results in poverty reduction. Bangladesh is a notable example, where initiatives such as investments in girls' education, microfinance programs, and improved agricultural practices have resulted in significant poverty reduction within the country.

While progress has been made, several challenges persist that hinder the realization of SDG 1. Insufficient funding and financial resources, limited capacity of governments to design and implement effective poverty reduction strategies, conflicts, natural disasters, and climate change are among the main obstacles.

To accelerate progress towards SDG 1, the report outlines recommendations for policymakers and stakeholders. These include increasing investments in poverty eradication measures, strengthening social protection systems, prioritizing investments in education and healthcare, alleviating rural poverty through agricultural development and infrastructure improvements, and fostering international cooperation to address regional disparities.

In conclusion, the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030, as envisaged by SDG 1, is an ambitious but essential goal for global sustainable development. It requires concerted efforts, effective policy interventions, and targeted interventions for vulnerable populations, notably children. By addressing the multidimensional aspects of poverty, mobilizing resources, and enhancing collaboration among nations, we can strive towards a more equitable and prosperous world, leaving no one behind.
