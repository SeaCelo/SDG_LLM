In recent years, the issue of poverty eradication has gained substantial momentum and attention across the global development landscape. The commitment to address this issue is evident in the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which encompasses the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We, at the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), recognize the urgency and significance of SDG 1: to end poverty in all its forms everywhere. In this analytical report, we will provide an in-depth analysis of the current status of SDG 1, its targets, progress made, challenges faced, and potential pathways for achieving this ambitious global goal.

SDG 1 is aimed at eliminating poverty, not just in income terms but also in multidimensional contexts. The goal encompasses dimensions such as access to education, healthcare, clean water, sanitation, and social protection for the poorest and most vulnerable populations. By addressing poverty comprehensively, SDG 1 aims to pave the way for sustainable development, ensuring that no one is left behind.

1.1. Target 1: By 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than $1.90 a day.

Significant progress has been made in reducing extreme poverty in recent decades. A large number of developing countries have witnessed significant declines in poverty rates. However, continued efforts are needed, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia, where the prevalence of extreme poverty remains disproportionately high. Access to quality healthcare and education, along with the creation of decent work opportunities, is vital to lift the most vulnerable populations out of extreme poverty.

1.2. Target 2: By 2030, reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women, and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions.

Addressing poverty in all its dimensions requires an understanding of intersecting inequalities and vulnerabilities. Social protection schemes play a crucial role in mitigating the impact of economic shocks and reducing poverty rates. Efforts should focus on strengthening social safety nets, providing inclusive access to healthcare, education, and essential services, and ensuring fair and equal earning opportunities across genders, age groups, and geographical locations.

Challenges in achieving SDG 1:

1. Lack of adequate resources and financial commitments to support poverty eradication efforts at the global level is a fundamental challenge. Mobilizing financial resources, both from domestic and international sources, is crucial.

2. Addressing structural inequalities and disparities is essential for sustainable poverty alleviation. This requires policies that promote inclusivity, equitable access to services and opportunities, and greater social cohesion.

3. Conflict, fragility, and natural disasters pose significant challenges to poverty eradication efforts. Development interventions should integrate conflict prevention, peacebuilding, and disaster risk reduction strategies to address these challenges effectively.

4. Data availability and quality remain vital for monitoring progress. Strengthening statistical capacities and developing comprehensive monitoring mechanisms is essential to track poverty reduction efforts and inform more effective policy making.

5. Engaging all stakeholders, including governments, civil society organizations, multilateral institutions, and the private sector, is crucial for shared commitment and coordinated action to achieve SDG 1.

Potential pathways for achieving SDG 1:

1. Enhancing international cooperation and commitment to increase Official Development Assistance (ODA) is critical. Strengthening partnerships with multilateral institutions and fostering South-South cooperation could provide additional resources for poverty reduction efforts.

2. Pursuing fair trade policies that prioritize the interests of developing countries could create more equitable economic opportunities and contribute to poverty reduction.

3. Promoting regional integration and providing technical support to developing countries in developing effective poverty reduction strategies tailored to their specific contexts is essential.

4. Investing in critical sectors such as education, healthcare, water, and sanitation is pivotal for poverty eradication. Increased investments in infrastructure and access to basic services can enhance opportunities, economic productivity, and overall human development.

5. Strengthening governance frameworks, ensuring accountability, and promoting inclusive participatory approaches in policy formulation processes can contribute to more effective poverty alleviation efforts.

Conclusion:

SDG 1 presents an ambitious and transformative vision to eliminate poverty in all its dimensions. It requires comprehensive actions, tailored policies, and strengthened partnerships to ensure that no one is left behind. While progress has been made, persistent challenges, such as inadequate resources, structural inequalities, conflict, and data gaps, demand increased commitment and interventions at various levels. With renewed global dedication and collaborative efforts, it is possible to achieve SDG 1 and contribute to a more equitable and sustainable world for all.
