Introduction:
The Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN) presents this detailed analytical report on the current status of Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1) - "End Poverty in all its forms everywhere." This report targets an expert audience with a focus on key issues and progress made towards achieving this goal globally.

Measurement of Poverty:
To effectively analyze SDG 1, it is crucial to define and measure poverty. AKDN employs a multidimensional approach to understand poverty beyond income-based measures like the International Poverty Line (IPL). Besides monetary poverty, the network assesses metrics related to education, health, access to basic services, and livelihood opportunities.

Global Poverty Trends:
Though considerable progress has been made in the past two decades, poverty remains a persistent global concern. The World Bank reported that in 2015, approximately 736 million people lived below the extreme poverty line, defined as $1.90 per day. Rates of poverty vary significantly across regions and within countries, reflecting social and economic disparities.

The Role of AKDN:
AKDN engages in poverty eradication through its integrated approach, recognizing that poverty is a complex and interconnected issue. The network's focus sectors include education, health, civil society, economic development, and infrastructure enhancement, among others. Large-scale projects, implemented in collaboration with stakeholders and local communities, have contributed to poverty reduction.

Empowering Communities:
AKDN acknowledges that sustainable development demands the involvement of local communities from planning to implementation stages. By supporting community-driven initiatives, the network prioritizes empowering individuals, particularly women and marginalised groups, to actively participate in their own development processes. This approach strengthens social fabric and makes progress towards eradicating poverty more sustainable.

Education:
Education is a cornerstone of AKDN's poverty alleviation efforts. By investing in quality education, AKDN addresses barriers to economic growth and empowers individuals to break the cycle of poverty. The network's initiatives focus on improving access to education, enhancing the quality of teaching and learning, and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all.

Healthcare:
AKDN recognizes that poor health exacerbates poverty and prevents socioeconomic development. Through established healthcare institutions and innovative solutions, AKDN provides access to quality healthcare, especially in remote and underserved regions. The network also focuses on preventive measures, such as maternal and child health programs and disease control initiatives.

Economic Development:
AKDN implements sustainable economic development programs to create income-generating opportunities and improve livelihoods. By promoting entrepreneurship, vocational training, and job creation, AKDN aims to equip individuals with the skills and means necessary for economic self-sufficiency. Collaborations with local industries and the private sector facilitate inclusive and sustainable economic growth.

Infrastructure and Long-term Investments:
Investing in infrastructure serves as the foundation for eradicating poverty. AKDN mobilizes resources, expertise, and partnerships to develop critical infrastructure like schools, hospitals, water and sanitation systems, energy projects, and transportation networks. These investments facilitate equitable access to essential services and support economic growth.

Ongoing Challenges:
While progress has been achieved, systematic challenges hinder SDG 1's complete realization. Issues such as income inequality, climate change, conflicts, political instability, and gender disparities continue to perpetuate and deepen poverty. Addressing these challenges requires cross-sectoral collaboration, policy reforms, and long-term financial commitments.

Conclusion:
AKDN's comprehensive approach towards SDG 1 is centered on empowering individuals, involving local communities, and fostering sustainable development to eradicate poverty worldwide. Through its diverse range of initiatives in education, healthcare, economic development, and infrastructure, AKDN has made significant contributions to poverty reduction. However, challenges persist, calling for continued collective action to address the multidimensional aspects of poverty and achieve long-lasting socio-economic development for all.
