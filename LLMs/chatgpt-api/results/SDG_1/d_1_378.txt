Introduction:
The International Development Evaluation Unit
(IDEU) of the United Nations is pleased to present this detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1): "No Poverty." Designed specifically for expert audiences, this report aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current status, challenges, and progress made towards achieving SDG 1 since its adoption in 2015. It will delve into the core aspects of SDG 1, including its targets, key issue areas, implementation strategies, and notable achievements.

Current Status:
SDG 1 represents a critical global commitment to eradicate poverty in all its forms and dimensions and ensure the social, economic, and environmental well-being of all people. It encompasses interconnected challenges such as extreme poverty, vulnerability, inequality, and social exclusion. The United Nations member states recognized these challenges when designing SDG 1 and set ambitious targets to be achieved by 2030.

Key Targets:
The initial target of SDG 1 is to ensure that by 2030, all men and women, particularly the poor and vulnerable, have equal rights and access to economic resources, basic services, ownership, and control over land and other forms of property. Additionally, the eradication of extreme poverty, defined as living on less than $1.90 per day, must be achieved.

Challenges and Obstacles:
One of the significant challenges to achieving SDG 1 is the persistence of multidimensional poverty, particularly in developing countries. Poverty is rarely just a lack of income. It encompasses a lack of access to education, inadequate healthcare, limited job opportunities, gender inequality, and social discrimination, among other dimensions. Complex and interconnected challenges often require integrated strategies and a holistic approach to address them effectively.

Furthermore, achieving SDG 1 necessitates collective action and collaboration between developed and developing countries, along with targeted policies that empower the poor and vulnerable to become part of the development process. Adequate financial resources and investments in improving infrastructure, human capital, and social protection systems are vital instruments to reduce poverty and enhance sustainable development.

Implementation Strategies:
To address these challenges, countries must promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, enhance human well-being, achieve full employment, decent work for all, and formalize the informal economy. This can be achieved through measures like capacity-building, technical assistance, knowledge sharing, and effective policy frameworks.

National poverty reduction strategies, backed by sound governance, play a crucial role in shaping action plans and allocating resources effectively. Governments must integrate SDG 1 into their national development plans, ensuring policy coherence across sectors such as education, health, social protection, and employment generation.

Notable Achievements:
While challenges remain, notable achievements have been made in the pursuit of SDG 1. Globally, extreme poverty rates have been reduced significantly in the past few decades, indicating progress towards the 2030 target. Additionally, social assistance programs and cash transfer initiatives have successfully lifted many individuals and households out of poverty and contributed to reducing inequality.

The international community has contributed extensively to poverty reduction efforts through funding, technical support, and innovative partnerships. For instance, initiatives like the World Bank's International Development Association, the United Nations Development Programme, and innovative financing mechanisms like impact investing have played a crucial role in advancing SDG 1.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, SDG 1 outlines an ambitious and compelling framework toward ending poverty and establishing sustainable development for all. It requires transformative actions, coordinated efforts, and innovative approaches from governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector. While progress has been achieved, persisting challenges demand renewed commitment, robust policies, and targeted interventions to ensure "No Poverty" becomes a reality for every individual across the globe. Through continued coordination and collaboration, we can collectively make substantial strides towards achieving SDG 1 by 2030.
