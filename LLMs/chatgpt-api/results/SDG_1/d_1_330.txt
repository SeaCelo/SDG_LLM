Introduction:
In recent years, efforts to achieve sustainable development have gained global attention. The United Nationsâ€™ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) play a crucial role in guiding international cooperation towards sustainable development. This report aims to provide a detailed analysis of SDG 1, which focuses on eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions. As a leading agency in international cooperation, Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) offers expertise and recommendations in this report for tackling poverty.

Analytical Findings:
1. The Extent of Poverty: Despite advances in economic growth and poverty reduction, poverty remains a significant concern worldwide, with 10% of the global population still living in extreme poverty. However, regional disparities persist, and poverty disproportionately affects vulnerable groups such as women, children, and marginalized communities.

2. Importance of Poverty Alleviation: Poverty undermines social cohesion, economic growth, and political stability. It leads to reduced access to education, limited healthcare services, and exclusion from social and economic opportunities. Therefore, the eradication of poverty is fundamental to achieving sustainable development.

3. Multidimensionality of Poverty: SDG 1 recognizes that poverty is multi-dimensional, extending beyond income inadequacy. It encompasses aspects such as limited education, poor health, inadequate housing, lack of access to clean water and sanitation, and social exclusion. Addressing poverty requires a comprehensive and integrated approach.

4. Challenges and Opportunities: While progress has been made in reducing global poverty, challenges persist. These include persistent inequality, lack of equitable economic growth, conflicts, climate change impacts, and structural barriers. Nevertheless, technological advancements, innovative approaches, and international partnerships offer opportunities to overcome these challenges.

5. Integration with Other SDGs: Eradicating poverty is closely intertwined with other SDGs. For instance, SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), and SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) contribute to poverty reduction by empowering individuals and fostering inclusive economic growth. Addressing poverty is, therefore, vital for overall sustainable development.

Recommendations:
1. Strengthen Social Protection Measures: To address multidimensional poverty, countries should strengthen social protection systems, such as social safety nets, conditional cash transfers, and universal healthcare coverage. These measures provide a crucial safety net for vulnerable populations, ensuring access to basic necessities.

2. Promote Inclusive Economic Growth: Countries must focus on inclusive economic growth to eradicate poverty sustainably. This includes investing in sectors with high employment potential, promoting entrepreneurship, and enhancing access to finance, technology, and markets for marginalized communities. Capacity-building programs for skills development are also essential to enhance employability.

3. Enhance Data Collection and Monitoring: Accurate and timely data is crucial for effective poverty eradication strategies. Governments and development partners should invest in robust data collection systems to assess poverty trends, monitor progress, and target interventions. This includes leveraging new technologies, such as mobile data collection and satellite imagery.

4. Strengthen International Cooperation: International cooperation is imperative to eradicate poverty globally. KOICA recommends that governments and stakeholders collaborate on sharing knowledge, best practices, and innovations. Resource mobilization, official development assistance, and private sector engagement should be harnessed alongside technology transfer for maximum impact.

Conclusion:
SDG 1 highlights the critical need to eradicate poverty in all its dimensions. Efforts to address poverty require comprehensive approaches that integrate social protection, inclusive economic growth, and data-driven policies. Eradicating poverty is not only a moral imperative but also directly contributes to achieving other SDGs. By implementing the recommendations presented, stakeholders can accelerate progress towards achieving SDG 1 and a more inclusive and sustainable future. KOICA remains committed to supporting international efforts in poverty eradication through enhanced collaboration and innovative approaches.
