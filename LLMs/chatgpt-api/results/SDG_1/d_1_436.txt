In recent years, eradicating poverty and embracing sustainable development has gained significant momentum across the globe. As international organizations like the United Nations (UN) push for this agenda, an important framework has been established to guide global efforts known as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This report seeks to provide an in-depth analysis of SDG 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere, focusing on the progress made, challenges faced, and potential solutions.

Goal 1 of the SDGs highlights the importance of addressing poverty comprehensively. Poverty is not only about income or lack thereof, but encompasses a multidimensional deprivation of basic human needs, including education, health, water, sanitation, housing, and more. Peace Direct recognizes the significance of addressing these various facets to create effective and sustainable poverty alleviation strategies.

Several strides have been made towards achieving SDG 1 since its inception. For example, the global poverty rate, which stood at 36% in 1990, fell to 8.2% in 2019. Significant progress has been witnessed in East Asia and the Pacific region, with extreme poverty decreasing from 59% in 1990 to 1.4% in 2015. India, home to a significant portion of the world's poor, has also made substantial gains in reducing poverty.

Factors contributing to these achievements include economic growth, improved access to education, innovative social programs, and targeted interventions by governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). These successes underscore the importance of utilizing a multifaceted approach to poverty alleviation, encompassing both economic and social dimensions.

However, despite these positive trends, challenges persist in the fight against poverty, particularly in conflict-affected regions. Armed conflict and political instability exacerbate poverty, disrupt social systems, and undermine development efforts. In these fragile contexts, achieving SDG 1 requires tailored approaches that prioritize peacebuilding efforts alongside socioeconomic interventions.

Furthermore, addressing the interlinked nature of poverty calls for innovative strategies. Income-generation initiatives, skills training, and access to financial services are crucial components for poverty alleviation, but they must be accompanied by investments in education, healthcare, and basic infrastructure. Women, marginalized communities, and people living with disabilities often bear the brunt of poverty, necessitating targeted initiatives to address their specific needs and promote inclusivity.

To achieve lasting progress in poverty eradication, collaboration between governments, NGOs, civil society organizations, and local communities is crucial. Achieving SDG 1 necessitates mobilizing resources, sharing best practices, and promoting knowledge exchange between nations. South-South cooperation, peer learning, and partnerships between different actors are key in this process.

Peace Direct considers grassroots peacebuilding organizations, which work directly in affected communities, as valuable stakeholders in achieving SDG 1. These organizations are well placed to address the root causes of poverty by engaging communities in decision-making, strengthening social cohesion, and promoting equitable development. However, such organizations often face challenges in securing sustainable funding and lack recognition at the global level.

In conclusion, SDG 1 provides a comprehensive framework to address poverty in all its dimensions. While progress has been made, challenges remain, particularly in conflict-affected areas. To accelerate progress, it is crucial to adopt a multidimensional approach that integrates social, economic, and peacebuilding interventions. Cooperation between various stakeholders will be essential, and grassroots peacebuilding organizations must be adequately supported to contribute effectively to SDG 1. Peace Direct emphasizes the need for sustained efforts to realize the goal of eradicating poverty and creating a more equitable and inclusive future for all.
