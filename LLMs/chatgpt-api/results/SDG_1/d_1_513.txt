Abstract:
This article comprehensively explores Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1), which aims to end poverty in all its forms everywhere. An analysis of global poverty trends, the multifaceted nature of poverty, and the challenges faced in achieving this esteemed goal will be presented. The article offers a critical evaluation of policy interventions and draws on empirical evidence, highlighting the need for effective strategies to accelerate progress. It emphasizes the indispensable role of public economics in fostering sustainable development while addressing poverty alleviation. Recommendations are formulated based on a comparative analysis of successful initiatives worldwide.

1. Introduction:
SDG 1 recognizes poverty as a complex issue requiring holistic approaches. The goal aims to not just reduce moderate and extreme poverty rates but eradicate them entirely. This article frames SDG 1 through the lens of public economics, considering fiscal policies, public resources allocation, and socio-economic inequalities.

2. Global Poverty Trends:
The first section provides an overview of global poverty, examining both regional disparities and the impact on vulnerable populations such as women, children, and marginalized communities. Despite remarkable progress, significant challenges remain in many regions. A comparative analysis of poverty indicators helps understand varying poverty landscapes and informs policy recommendations.

3. Multidimensional Dimensions of Poverty:
Poverty extends beyond insufficient income, encompassing education, health, sanitation, and social exclusion. Therefore, this section delves into the multidimensional dimensions of poverty, highlighting the need for comprehensive policies that target all facets of poverty. Drawing on empirical research, we identify strategies that have successfully addressed these different dimensions and discuss scalability and replicability.

4. Policy Interventions and Strategies:
The following section critically evaluates policy interventions proposed by governments, international agencies, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to reach SDG 1. This analysis assesses the efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainability of various approaches, such as conditional cash transfers, social protection programs, microfinance, and community-driven initiatives. Heterogeneous contexts necessitate adapting policies to local environments.

5. Public Economics and Poverty Alleviation:
Public economics plays a pivotal role in designing comprehensive poverty-reduction strategies and resource allocation. This section explores how fiscal policies, taxation reforms, inclusive budget allocations, and public-private partnerships can address poverty and socio-economic inequalities. Furthermore, it considers the importance of inter-sectoral coordination and comprehensive monitoring systems.

6. Lessons from Successful Initiatives:
By examining successful poverty alleviation programs worldwide, this section enriches our understanding of effective measures. Strengthening social safety nets, improving access to education and healthcare, enhancing financial inclusion, and promoting sustainable livelihoods emerge as key components in these initiatives. Comparative analysis helps identify successful strategies transferable across contexts.

7. Challenges and Recommendations:
The penultimate section critically discusses the persistent challenges towards achieving SDG 1. It emphasizes the need for inclusive growth, gender equality, rural development, climate-resilient infrastructure, and Good Governance. The implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on poverty eradication efforts are also addressed. Recommendations for policy and research are formulated, highlighting the synergies with other SDGs.

8. Conclusion:
This article concludes with a call for robust and coordinated efforts that transcend income-focused approaches and embrace the multidimensionality of poverty. Public economics holds immense potential to shape inclusive policies that address the root causes of poverty. By integrating economics, governance, and social development, SDG 1 can be fully realized, catalyzing transformative change towards a poverty-free future.
