The International Red Cross is pleased to present this analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 1, which aims to “End poverty in all its forms everywhere.” As a key stakeholder in global humanitarian efforts, the International Red Cross recognizes the significance of this goal in addressing the root causes of poverty and fostering sustainable development.

Poverty eradication is essential for achieving broader development objectives and creating an equitable world for all. By examining the current state of SDG 1 and its associated targets, this report aims to provide our expert audience with a comprehensive analysis to facilitate informed decision-making and support effective strategies for poverty reduction.

At present, the global poverty rate highlights the urgent need for action. About 9% of the world’s population still lives in extreme poverty, struggling to survive on less than $1.90 per day. Additionally, a significant portion of the global population lives in multidimensional poverty, facing challenges such as limited access to education, healthcare, clean water, and sanitation.

This target to end poverty in all forms necessitates a multidimensional approach, addressing income inequality, social exclusion, and limited access to essential services. Efforts to tackle poverty must be underpinned by factors such as strengthened social protection systems, inclusive economic growth, and access to basic services for the most vulnerable populations.

Promoting inclusive economic growth remains crucial for poverty eradication. It is essential to ensure that everyone, regardless of their income level or socio-economic background, has access to diverse economic opportunities. This requires strategies aimed at reducing income disparities, fostering entrepreneurship, and addressing gender inequality in the labor market.

To fully achieve SDG 1, we must also address the socio-political factors that perpetuate poverty. Social exclusion and discrimination based on factors such as gender, ethnicity, nationality, or disability contribute to the perpetuation of poverty cycles. Therefore, it is imperative to promote inclusive governance structures, advance human rights, and empower marginalized and vulnerable groups. This can be achieved through the provision of legal protection, equitable access to justice, and socio-political participation.

The International Red Cross recognizes that the eradication of poverty requires collaborative efforts, involving governments, international institutions, civil society organizations, and the private sector. Ostensibly, coordination and partnerships across different sectors are essential to mobilize adequate resources, share knowledge, and implement effective poverty reduction strategies. It is particularly vital to engage local communities and grassroots organizations, as their valuable insights and active participation can ensure an inclusive and bottom-up approach to poverty eradication.

The COVID-19 pandemic has acutely exacerbated the poverty crisis, highlighting the urgency to address this goal comprehensively. Consequently, it is essential to integrate SDG 1 into broader policy actions as part of disaster response and recovery efforts. Investments in social protection, healthcare systems, education, and innovative approaches to livelihood development are critical to building resilience and improving the socio-economic conditions of vulnerable populations in crises and beyond.

In conclusion, Sustainable Development Goal 1 stands at the core of creating a more just and equitable world, free from poverty. Eradicating poverty requires a holistic and multidimensional approach, addressing income disparities, social exclusion, and limited access to essential services. The International Red Cross acknowledges the significance of collective action, collaborations, and the active engagement of marginalized communities to achieve tangible and meaningful progress towards this goal. By focusing our efforts on poverty eradication, the foundation for sustainable development and an inclusive future can be laid.
