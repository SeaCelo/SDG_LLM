In recent years, much attention has been drawn toward the issue of poverty eradication, prompting the international community to set a goal: sustainable development. With the launch of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by the United Nations in 2015, SDG 1, focused on ending poverty in all its forms everywhere, took center stage.

One might ask, what constitutes poverty? To put it simply, poverty can be understood as a state of deprivation. However, it extends beyond mere monetary circumstances to encompass lack of access to basic necessities such as food, water, education, healthcare, and clean energy. Consequently, the eradication of poverty is not just about increasing income, but also ensuring access to vital resources and opportunities.

Addressing the multidimensional nature of poverty necessitates a holistic approach. SDG 1 highlights the interconnectedness between poverty and other areas, such as inequality, climate change, gender discrimination, and conflict. These interlinkages emphasize the need to address poverty in a comprehensive manner, rather than treating it as an isolated issue.

A key aspect of SDG 1 is the target to eradicate extreme poverty. To achieve this, sustainable economic growth is crucial. However, sustainable growth is not limited to economic prosperity, but also involves social inclusion and environmental sustainability. It requires addressing Unemployment, inequalities, and vulnerability while ensuring environmental protection and resource efficiency. In this regard, the role of governments and the importance of effective policies cannot be overstated.

In order to achieve SDG 1, a significant shift in thinking is necessary. Moving beyond traditional aid-based interventions, the focus should be on promoting inclusivity, reducing vulnerabilities, and empowering individuals and communities. This requires investments in education, healthcare, social protection, and infrastructure, as well as creating an enabling environment for entrepreneurship and small-scale enterprises. Inclusion, empowerment, and resilience should be at the heart of poverty eradication efforts.

Furthermore, gender equality is a cross-cutting issue that deserves special attention within SDG 1. Women and girls are disproportionately affected by poverty, facing gender-based discrimination and limited access to resources. Closing the gender gap, empowering women economically, and ensuring their participation in decision-making processes are critical steps towards poverty eradication.

It is important to recognize that poverty is not a standalone issue and cannot be solved in isolation. SDG 1 should be seen as part of a larger agenda for sustainable development. Key to its success is the integration of poverty eradication efforts with other SDGs, such as SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 4 (quality education), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), and SDG 13 (climate action), to name a few. Only through cross-sectoral collaboration and innovative solutions can we achieve meaningful social, economic, and environmental progress.

In conclusion, SDG 1 presents an ambitious but crucial target: to end poverty in all its forms everywhere. This goal goes beyond mere financial measures, encompassing social inclusion, environmental sustainability, and addressing the root causes of poverty. It requires a comprehensive and holistic approach, integrating gender equality, promoting sustainable economic growth, and fostering cross-sectoral collaboration. By adopting innovative strategies, investing in resources, and empowering communities, we can create a more equitable and prosperous world â€“ a world free from poverty.
