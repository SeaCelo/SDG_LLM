In order to provide an in-depth analysis of Sustainable Development Goal 1 â€“ No Poverty, this report focuses on the current status of global poverty and the efforts being made to eradicate it. The objective is to provide policymakers and expert stakeholders with insights and recommendations to inform evidence-based decisions and drive progress towards this critical sustainable development goal.

Introduction
Sustainable Development Goal 1, adopted by all United Nations Member States as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, aims to eliminate extreme poverty and reduce by at least half the proportion of people living in poverty in all its dimensions by 2030. Global poverty remains a significant challenge, with millions of people still facing extreme deprivation. This report provides an in-depth analysis of the current situation and highlights the pathways toward achieving the ambitious targets set under SDG 1.

Current Status of Global Poverty
Despite significant progress over the past few decades, poverty continues to be a major roadblock to sustainable development. According to the latest estimates by the World Bank, approximately 9.2% of the world's population lived in extreme poverty in 2019, which translates to about 689 million people living on less than $1.90 per day. The majority of these individuals are concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.

One of the key findings highlighted in this report is the multidimensional nature of poverty. Beyond income deprivation, poverty encompasses insufficient access to basic services such as healthcare, education, clean water, sanitation, and adequate housing. Addressing poverty in all its dimensions requires holistic and integrated approaches that go beyond income poverty measures.

Challenges and Bottlenecks
Several challenges hinder the achievement of SDG 1. Inadequate economic growth, vulnerability to external shocks, persistent income inequality, and social exclusion are significant bottlenecks that need to be addressed. Climate change, conflicts, and political instability also exacerbate poverty and hinder progress. In order to achieve sustainable and lasting poverty reduction, it is vital to address these structural and systemic challenges through tailored policies and interventions.

Efforts and Commitments for Poverty Reduction
Recognizing the urgency and importance of tackling poverty, governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector have committed to various efforts aimed at reducing poverty and ensuring inclusivity. Comprehensive poverty reduction strategies, targeted social protection programs, investments in human capital development, and improvements in infrastructure are among the critical interventions deployed globally to address poverty and inequality.

Policies such as conditional cash transfers, skills development programs, promoting rural livelihoods, and inclusive financial services have shown promise in lifting households out of poverty. Additionally, joint efforts by stakeholders to address the root causes of poverty, improve governance, and foster social cohesion are indispensable avenues to achieve sustainable poverty reduction.

Recommendations for Accelerating Progress
Despite these efforts, current trends suggest that the world is not on track to achieve SDG 1 by 2030. To accelerate progress and ensure no one is left behind, this report puts forth the following recommendations:

1. Enhance Data Monitoring and Quality: Improvements in data collection, disaggregation, and monitoring are essential for effective and evidence-based policymaking. Invest in robust measurement systems, monitoring tools, and data management frameworks to track poverty reduction efforts accurately.

2. Strengthen Social Protection: Strengthen the design and implementation of social safety nets and social protection programs, integrating mechanisms to target the most vulnerable populations. Ensure effective coverage, increase recognition of the care economy, and enhance shock-responsive social protection mechanisms.

3. Foster Inclusive Economic Growth: Promote pro-poor, sustainable growth by investing in infrastructure, innovation, and technological advancements. Facilitate access to finance for micro, small, and medium-sized businesses. Additionally, implement policies to eradicate discrimination, reduce inequalities, and bridge economic disparities.

4. Adopt a Human Rights-based Approach: Embed a human rights-based approach in poverty reduction strategies to empower marginalized communities and individuals, ensuring their participation in decision-making processes, and promoting access to justice.

5. Strengthen International Cooperation: Enhance global partnerships, resource mobilization, knowledge sharing, and capacity building to accelerate progress towards SDG 1. Foster south-south cooperation and create enabling environments for international development assistance.

Conclusion
Addressing poverty remains a central challenge in the path towards sustainable development. The solutions must account for the multidimensional nature of poverty, encompassing income deprivation, lack of access to basic services, and social exclusion. It is imperative for policymakers, institutions, and all stakeholders to redouble their efforts in eradicating poverty through innovative policies, targeted interventions, and collaborative partnerships. Achieving Sustainable Development Goal 1 will not only transform lives but also provide a solid foundation for attaining other interlinked sustainable development goals.
