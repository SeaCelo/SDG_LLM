Title: Achieving Sustainable Development Goal 1: A Catalyst for Economic Growth

Abstract: 
This article comprehensively explores Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1, which aims to eradicate extreme poverty by implementing effective social protection systems and promoting equal access to basic services. In line with the principles of the Journal of Economic Growth, this study focuses on the vital role that SDG 1 plays in fostering economic growth and long-term development. Through a comparative analysis of various global case studies and empirical data, we evaluate the progress made towards achieving SDG 1 and propose recommendations to accelerate efforts in eradicating poverty and fostering inclusive economic growth.

1. Introduction
As the first Sustainable Development Goal specified by the United Nations, SDG 1 acts as a foundational pillar for achieving sustainable development globally. The eradication of extreme poverty addresses interrelated parameters such as access to social safety nets, basic education, healthcare, housing, and clean water, thereby enabling inclusive growth and reducing socio-economic inequalities.

2. Poverty Traps and Economic Growth
The persistent cycle of poverty poses a significant challenge for economic growth. SDG 1 becomes the basis of breaking the poverty traps by addressing both immediate and long-term needs. It promotes sustainable development by removing barriers that limit access to resources and opportunities that help individuals and communities break free from poverty's grip.

3. Progress and Challenges
Despite remarkable progress made in certain regions, eradicating extreme poverty remains an uphill battle globally. This section provides an overview of global progress towards SDG 1, analyzing both successful initiatives and significant obstacles faced. Case studies from regions such as Scandinavia, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa are examined for comparative analysis, highlighting various policy approaches and their economic impact.

4. Monitoring and Evaluation
Accurate measurement is a crucial component of sustainable development efforts. This section discusses the main indicators used to track progress in poverty eradication efforts under SDG 1. These metrics offer a nuanced understanding of poverty dynamics, allowing policymakers and stakeholders to design targeted interventions and adjust approaches accordingly.

5. Policy Recommendations for Sustainable Poverty Eradication
This section provides insights into policy interventions necessary to achieve SDG 1 comprehensively. It highlights the importance of implementing robust social protection systems to create an enabling environment for vulnerable populations. Promotion of inclusive and equitable education, healthcare, and employment opportunities is emphasized to provide individuals with the necessary tools for long-term economic growth and participation.

6. SDG 1 and Economic Spillovers
Recognizing the interdependence of the SDGs, this section elucidates how achieving SDG 1 not only contributes to individual and national economic growth but also creates positive externalities in related domains. By targeting extreme poverty and reducing inequalities, a more sustainable and open society can be fostered.

7. Public-Private Partnerships for Poverty Eradication
Engaging the private sector is critical to mobilize the resources required for poverty eradication efforts. This section explores successful collaborations between governments, civil society organizations, and businesses in achieving SDG 1. It highlights the importance of aligning the profit motive with social impact, fostering innovative business models, and knowledge-sharing platforms that galvanize collective action.

8. Conclusion
This article underscores the central role played by SDG 1 in paving the way for sustainable economic growth and development. By addressing extreme poverty and implementing strategies that ensure equal access to basic social services, the world inches closer to a truly inclusive and equitable global society. Achieving SDG 1 is not only an essential milestone but also a catalyst for realizing the remaining Sustainable Development Goals.

In line with the focus of the Journal of Economic Growth, this article combines economic analysis, comparative studies, and policy recommendations to provide holistic insights into the pursuit of SDG 1. It aims to contribute to the international dialogue on sustainable development while inspiring policymakers, researchers, and practitioners to prioritize efforts that redress extreme poverty, promote economic growth, and foster inclusive societies.
