Abstract

Sustainable Development Goal 1 focuses on ending poverty in all its forms and dimensions. This article examines the progress made in achieving this goal since its adoption in 2015, and explores the challenges that still lie ahead. It discusses the multidimensionality of poverty, highlighting the need for strategies that address not only income poverty, but also capabilities poverty and social exclusion. Drawing on global data and empirical research, the article assesses the effectiveness of various policy interventions in reducing poverty, including social protection mechanisms, job creation, and access to quality education and healthcare. The analysis reveals significant disparities in poverty reduction across regions and highlights the importance of targeted efforts in achieving equitable outcomes. The article concludes by proposing a comprehensive approach that integrates economic growth with social protection, employment generation, and inclusive institutions to effectively address the complex issue of poverty.

1. Introduction

Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1) aims to eradicate poverty in all its dimensions by 2030. By recognizing the multidimensionality of poverty, the goal goes beyond income poverty and encompasses dimensions such as education, health, social protection, and access to basic services. This article provides a comprehensive assessment of the progress made in achieving SDG 1, the challenges faced by policymakers, and possible pathways to eradicate poverty effectively.

2. Understanding Poverty as a Multidimensional Issue

Poverty is not solely defined by income levels, but encompasses a web of intersecting factors, such as access to education, healthcare, social protection, and civic participation. In order to effectively combat poverty, policies must address these multiple dimensions and go beyond income redistribution. This requires adopting a capability approach that focuses on enhancing people's capacities to lead productive lives, exercise agency, and participate fully in their communities.

3. Progress and Challenges in Poverty Reduction

Despite significant progress in poverty reduction over the past few decades, disparities persist across regions. Sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, still faces the highest poverty rates globally, while progress has been relatively stronger in regions like East Asia and the Pacific.

One of the main challenges in achieving SDG 1 is the lack of inclusive economic growth. High levels of inequality impede poverty reduction efforts, as gains mostly concentrate in the hands of a few. This calls for policies that not only aim to increase income levels but also promote equitable distribution of resources. Social protection mechanisms, such as conditional cash transfer programs, have proven effective in reducing poverty and inequality by providing support to the most vulnerable segments of the population. By providing a safety net and promoting human capital accumulation, social protection systems contribute to poverty reduction and social cohesion.

Furthermore, job creation is crucial for poverty eradication, particularly in developing countries where informal employment dominates. Promoting productive and decent work opportunities not only increases income levels but also empowers individuals and enhances social inclusion. Investing in education and vocational training is equally essential to equip individuals with the skills needed for employment in the modern economy.

Access to quality healthcare and education is essential in breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty. Universal access to affordable healthcare services and quality education plays a significant role in reducing inequalities and enabling individuals to lead dignified lives. Investing in these sectors not only has the potential to lift people out of poverty but is an investment in human capital and economic development as well.

4. Addressing the Spatial Dimension of Poverty

Regional disparities persist in poverty reduction efforts, with rural areas often experiencing higher poverty rates compared to urban areas. Policies that specifically target rural development, agricultural productivity, and infrastructure investments can contribute significantly to poverty eradication in these regions. Additionally, promoting social mobility and reducing spatial inequalities should be a priority for policymakers in order to ensure that no one is left behind.

5. Conclusion

Achieving Sustainable Development Goal 1 requires a comprehensive and multifaceted approach. Eradicating poverty goes beyond income redistribution; it necessitates addressing the multidimensional nature of poverty and utilizing targeted policy interventions. Social protection mechanisms, job creation, access to quality healthcare and education, and inclusive institutions are essential pillars for poverty reduction. Furthermore, efforts should be geographically stratified, as regional disparities persist. By integrating economic growth with social development, inclusive policies, and equitable outcomes, the global community has the potential to eradicate poverty and build a more prosperous and sustainable world for all.
