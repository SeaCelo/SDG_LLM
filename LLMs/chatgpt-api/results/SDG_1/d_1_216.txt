In recent decades, governments, international organizations, and academia have increasingly recognized poverty eradication as a central objective of socioeconomic development. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have emerged as a comprehensive framework to address the multifaceted challenges of poverty and inequality on a global scale. SDG 1 specifically focuses on eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions. As a leading economist, the purpose of this article is to provide analysis and insights into the SDG 1 target and its implications for sustainable development.

SDG 1 sets the ambitious goal of ending poverty in all its forms by 2030. This targets extreme poverty and widespread poverty, which remain persistent problems around the world. The SDG framework recognizes that poverty is not just about income deprivation, but also encompasses broader aspects such as lack of access to education, health care, and essential services, as well as the vulnerability to shocks and economic volatility.

To achieve SDG 1, a two-pronged approach must be pursued. First, it is imperative to focus on economic growth and job creation, as adequate employment opportunities are essential for individuals and households to escape poverty. Sustained economic growth can generate income, foster entrepreneurship, and create an enabling environment for investment and innovation. Moreover, economic growth should be inclusive and pro-poor, ensuring that the benefits are widely shared and vulnerabilities are reduced through measures such as social protection systems.

Second, complementary to economic growth, social policies and interventions are crucial in addressing the multifaceted nature of poverty. Education represents a key tool in breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty, empowering individuals with knowledge and skills to participate in economic and social life. Additionally, improving access to quality healthcare and social protection systems can provide a safety net for vulnerable individuals and households, shielding them from potential shocks and risks.

While the target of ending poverty by 2030 is ambitious, progress has been made since the adoption of the SDGs. The global poverty rate has steadily declined, with millions being lifted out of extreme poverty. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed significant vulnerabilities, reversed gains, and highlighted the need for a concerted effort to effectively implement SDG 1 by promoting inclusive growth and addressing systemic inequalities.

In the pursuit of SDG 1, it is crucial to adopt a multi-dimensional and integrated approach. Data and evidence-based policymaking are essential for understanding the dynamics of poverty and formulating targeted interventions. Collaborative efforts among governments, international organizations, civil society, the private sector, and academia are necessary to mobilize resources, leverage expertise, and promote innovative solutions.

Furthermore, addressing structural barriers and systemic challenges is fundamental to achieving sustainable poverty eradication. These include tackling gender disparities, enhancing access to land and natural resources for the poor, improving financial inclusion, promoting sustainable agriculture practices, and bridging regional disparities in terms of infrastructure and services.

In conclusion, as emphasized by SDG 1, poverty eradication represents a fundamental pillar of sustainable development. The target of ending poverty by 2030 requires a comprehensive approach that encompasses economic growth, social policies, and targeted interventions. Adequate employment, inclusive growth, access to education and healthcare, and social protection systems are crucial in this endeavor. Collaboration and integrated approaches are essential to effectively implement SDG 1 and address the inherent complexities and systemic barriers that perpetuate poverty and inequality. In pursuing these goals, policy efforts must remain focused, evidence-based, and adaptive to ensure sustained progress towards a more equitable and inclusive world.
