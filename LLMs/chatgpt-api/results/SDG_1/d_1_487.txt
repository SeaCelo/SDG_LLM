Reaching New Heights: India's Commitment to Achieving Sustainable Development Goal 1

Byline: The Times of India

India, a land of bountiful beauty and resolute resilience, stands at the doorstep of eradicating extreme poverty and creating a future where all its citizens can enjoy a life of dignity and opportunity. This vision for a brighter tomorrow falls perfectly in line with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1 – end poverty in all its forms everywhere.

Since the adoption of the SDGs by the United Nations in 2015, India has captivated the world with its unwavering determination to address poverty and uplift millions from destitution. Underpinned by empowering policies, innovative schemes, and the collective strength of its citizens, India is at the forefront of the global drive towards a poverty-free world.

At the heart of India's commitment to SDG 1 is its groundbreaking campaign, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana or Prime Minister's People's Wealth Initiative, launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014. With the aim of providing inclusive access to banking and financial services for all, this ambitious scheme has already brought an unprecedented number of families into the formal financial system, thereby reducing their dependence on informal, exploitative lenders.

Over the years, India's transformational efforts have yielded remarkable results. According to recent data from the World Bank, India has successfully reduced extreme poverty from 26% in 2011 to less than 10% in 2021. This remarkable feat is testament to India's unwavering dedication towards addressing systemic issues that perpetuate poverty, including access to education, healthcare, clean water, and affordable housing.

One of the standout initiatives that exemplify India's commitment to SDG 1 is the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana or PMAY, the world's largest affordable housing program. This flagship scheme aims to provide "Housing for All" by 2022 and has already provided millions of underprivileged families with a roof over their heads. By ensuring access to secure and adequate housing, India is allowing its citizens to break the generational cycle of poverty and providing a solid foundation for development and growth.

Furthermore, India recognizes the importance of building resilience and social protection infrastructure to safeguard its citizens from external shocks and unforeseen circumstances. The Garib Kalyan Rozgar Abhiyaan is one such extraordinary response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which not only created employment opportunities for migrant workers affected by the crisis but also provided them with necessary skills training and access to social welfare benefits.

However, India's journey towards eradicating poverty does not end here – much work lies ahead. Despite the incredible progress made, there are still marginalized communities and remote locations where poverty persists. India is acutely aware of this challenge and is committed to leaving no one behind. The ambitious National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme continues to provide wage employment to millions in rural areas, facilitating economic empowerment and bridging income disparities.

Addressing SDG 1 also requires concerted efforts to address multidimensional poverty, acknowledging that poverty is not confined to monetary measures alone. India's Aspirational Districts Programme is a major step in this direction, focusing on 112 districts that lag behind in human development indicators. By ensuring adequate healthcare, education, and social protection, this program aims to uplift the most vulnerable communities and ensure no one is left behind in India’s path to sustainable development.

As we reflect upon India's remarkable progress towards SDG 1, it is clear that commitment and practical solutions are the key drivers for lasting change. India’s steadfast determination to uplift its citizens from poverty serves as a global model, inspiring other nations to embark on similar transformative paths to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. By nurturing a vision of an inclusive and prosperous future, India reverberates with the spirit of human dignity, paving the way for a world free of poverty.

In the grand tapestry of sustainable development, India is transforming aspirations into reality. With each step taken, India reaffirms its position as a true champion of SDG 1 and as an inspiration to nations across the world on the path towards inclusive growth, equitable societies, and a poverty-free planet.
