1. Introduction

SDG 1 aims to end poverty in all its forms everywhere by 2030, ensuring that everyone has equal access to adequate food, basic services, and opportunities for economic advancement. As a member of the global community, Kuwait is dedicated to eliminating poverty and has made significant progress in this regard. This report provides an in-depth understanding of the current status of poverty in Kuwait and the initiatives taken by the Kuwaiti government to address this issue.

2. Current Status and Achievements

Kuwait is a high-income country with significant wealth, driven primarily by its oil reserves. However, despite its economic prosperity, Kuwait faces certain challenges in its poverty eradication efforts. Over the years, the government has taken proactive steps to alleviate poverty and ensure social welfare. The implementation of various socio-economic development plans, coupled with an efficient welfare system, has provided a safety net for vulnerable segments of the population.

One of the remarkable achievements in promoting anti-poverty initiatives is the establishment of the Public Authority for Social Security (PASS). PASS is responsible for providing aid and financial support to underprivileged individuals and families across the country. Kuwait's social welfare system, including pensions, housing subsidies, and financial assistance, has reduced poverty and enhanced the living standards of its citizens significantly.

Additionally, investment in education and healthcare has improved human capital development in Kuwait, subsequently reducing the vulnerability of individuals to poverty. Free education at all levels, subsidized healthcare, and improved infrastructure have all played a crucial role in empowering Kuwaiti citizens and equipping them with the necessary tools to achieve socioeconomic prosperity.

3. Key Challenges

Despite the accomplishments made, Kuwait still faces challenges on its path towards achieving SDG 1. Some of these challenges include:

a) Unequal Distribution of Wealth: Although Kuwait has a comprehensive welfare system in place, an unequal distribution of wealth remains a significant concern. Ensuring that wealth is distributed equitably could reinforce efforts to eradicate poverty and enable all citizens to benefit from economic growth.

b) Migrant Worker Exploitation: The reliance on foreign labor in Kuwait leads to an imbalanced labor market wherein migrant workers often face inadequate living conditions and exploitation. Addressing the vulnerabilities of migrant workers is imperative in eradicating poverty and achieving inclusive development.

4. Recommendations

To build upon its achievements and address the challenges ahead, the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development recommends the following strategic measures:

a) Strengthen Social Protection: Kuwait should work towards enhancing its social protection policies and programs, ensuring they are accessible to all citizens and expatriate workers. Emphasizing the importance of vulnerable groups, such as women, the elderly, and people with disabilities, can help curb poverty and vulnerability effectively.

b) Promote Equal Distribution of Wealth: Pursuing comprehensive policies to bridge the wealth gap and ensure an equitable distribution of resources among all population segments is crucial. Tax reforms and implementing measures to tackle corruption and bribery can contribute to leveling the playing field and ensuring inclusive growth.

c) Enhance Human Capital Development: Continued investment in education and healthcare is essential for fostering human capital development. Emphasis on quality education, skill training, and increasing access to essential healthcare services will empower individuals to overcome poverty and create a sustainable future.

Conclusion

In conclusion, Kuwait has made substantial progress in its efforts to alleviate poverty and achieve SDG 1. While accomplishments such as the establishment of the Public Authority for Social Security and the investment in education and healthcare are commendable, challenges persist. By strengthening social protection systems, promoting equal wealth distribution, and enhancing human capital development, Kuwait can reinforce its commitment to eliminate poverty and achieve sustainable development for all. The Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development encourages international collaboration and the exchange of best practices to accelerate progress towards SDG 1, laying a solid foundation for future socioeconomic prosperity in the country.
