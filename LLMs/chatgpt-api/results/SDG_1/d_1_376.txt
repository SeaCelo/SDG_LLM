Introduction

In recent decades, rapid economic growth and technological advancements have raised living standards for millions of people around the world. However, there remains a profound challenge of eradicating extreme poverty and reducing inequalities in every society. To address this, the United Nations established the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a blueprint for achieving a better and more sustainable future for all. This analytical report focuses specifically on SDG 1: No Poverty, which seeks to lift people out of extreme poverty, ensure social protection systems, and decrease disparities. As an expert analysis commissioned by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), this report examines the current status, challenges, and progress in implementing SDG 1.

Current Status

SDG 1 aims to eliminate extreme poverty, which is defined as living on less than $1.90 per day. While significant progress has been made in reducing global poverty, disparities persist across regions and within countries. The latest data shows that approximately 734 million people still live in extreme poverty, primarily in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia. These regions also face other major challenges such as a lack of access to basic services, high unemployment rates, and low levels of social protection.

Challenges and Key Issues

Numerous challenges hinder the achievement of SDG 1. First and foremost, economic inequality remains a significant barrier. The gap between the rich and the poor continues to widen, undercutting efforts to eradicate poverty. High unemployment rates, particularly among youth, exacerbate social and economic inequalities, hindering sustainable development.

Limited access to quality education and skills development aggravates poverty as well. Without adequate education, individuals are unable to access better employment opportunities and escape the cycle of poverty. This restraining factor is even more pronounced for those in marginalized groups, such as women, persons with disabilities, and ethnic minorities.

The lack of effective social protection systems in many countries poses another challenge. Social safety nets, including universal healthcare, social assistance programs, and insurance schemes, are crucial for vulnerability reduction and poverty eradication. However, in several Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs), such systems are either inadequate or non-existent, leaving millions without essential safeguards against poverty and destitution.

Progress Made and Innovative Approaches

While addressing the numerous challenges, significant progress has been made towards SDG 1. Governments, NGOs, and international organizations have launched various innovative initiatives to reduce poverty and inequality. For instance, conditional cash transfer programs have been implemented in countries like Brazil and Mexico, providing financial support to poor families in exchange for certain conditions, such as child enrollment in school and healthcare visits.

Additionally, innovative approaches such as mobile banking have effectively bridged the financial inclusion gap, enabling individuals in remote and impoverished areas to access financial services. The use of digital technologies and data analytics has also played a critical role in targeting interventions, improving efficiency, and monitoring progress towards poverty reduction.

Recommendations for Enhanced Impact

To accelerate progress towards SDG 1, concerted efforts are needed at national and global levels. The OECD recommends the following key interventions:

1. Strengthening social protection systems: Governments should prioritize the establishment or enhancement of comprehensive social safety nets, including universal healthcare, unemployment benefits, and basic income schemes. These systems should be designed to reach those in extreme poverty and vulnerable groups, guaranteeing a fairer and more equal society.

2. Investing in quality education and skills development: Countries must prioritize inclusive and quality education, providing equal opportunities for all. Enhancing the skills of the workforce is crucial for improving employability and ensuring sustained poverty reduction.

3. Promoting inclusive growth: Governments should focus on creating inclusive economies that provide decent work opportunities for all, as well as address the persistently high rates of youth unemployment and gender inequalities. Policies that promote entrepreneurship, innovation, and equal access to markets and resources are paramount.

4. Eliminating discriminatory practices: Discrimination based on gender, age, race, or disability perpetuates poverty and inequalities. Governments and international organizations should work together to eliminate such practices and promote equal rights and opportunities.

Conclusion

SDG 1 aims to tackle the multi-dimensional challenge of poverty eradication and reducing inequalities. While progress has been made, significant disparities persist. National governments, international organizations, and stakeholders need to take coordinated action to strengthen social protection systems, invest in education and skills development, promote inclusive growth, and eliminate discriminatory practices to accelerate progress towards SDG 1. The fight against poverty requires a comprehensive and multi-stakeholder approach, addressing economic, social, and structural determinants to ensure a sustainable and prosperous future for all.
