The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) presents a comprehensive and in-depth analytical report focused on Sustainable Development Goal 1: End Poverty in All Its Forms Everywhere. This report assesses the progress made towards achieving SDG 1, highlights key challenges, and provides recommendations to further advance this critical goal. Its intended audience includes policy-makers, development practitioners, and experts working on poverty alleviation initiatives.

SDG 1 aims to eradicate poverty in all its dimensions, including income, access to basic services, and social protection. It recognizes that sustainable development cannot be achieved without addressing the root causes and consequences of poverty. Since the adoption of the Sustainable Development Agenda in 2015, considerable efforts have been made to tackle poverty, but significant challenges persist.

According to the World Bank, the global extreme poverty rate fell to a record low of 9.2% in 2017. While this progress is commendable, it masks the uneven distribution of poverty reduction achievements across regions and countries. Sub-Saharan Africa continues to face the highest poverty rates, with over 40% of its population living in extreme poverty. Latin America and the Caribbean, despite having better poverty eradication indicators, also contain pockets of persistent poverty.

Several factors have contributed to advancements in poverty reduction. Increased access to education, improved healthcare, targeted social protection systems, and innovations in financial inclusion have played pivotal roles. Furthermore, concerted efforts such as enacting pro-poor policies, promoting inclusive economic growth, expanding social safety nets, and addressing systemic inequalities have been vital in combating poverty.

However, challenges persist in fully achieving SDG 1. A major barrier lies in addressing the multidimensional nature of poverty. Poverty is deeply interconnected with social vulnerabilities, uneven distribution of resources, unemployment, lack of basic infrastructure, and limited access to quality services. To comprehensively address poverty, multifaceted strategies are necessary, ranging from providing income support and vocational training to creating employment opportunities and improving access to affordable housing and healthcare.

Furthermore, fragility, conflict, and violence exacerbate poverty, making poverty reduction efforts more challenging in these contexts. Instances of forced displacement, natural disasters, and climate change-triggered economic vulnerabilities also impede sustainable poverty eradication. To tackle these complexities, coordination between humanitarian and development interventions is crucial, emphasizing the importance of integrated and innovative approaches.

Building partnerships and leveraging resources are key components of poverty eradication. The private sector can play a pivotal role through investments in sectors with high poverty reduction potential, such as agriculture, infrastructure, education, and renewable energy. MIGA, as part of its mandate, encourages private sector engagement by providing political risk guarantees to attract investors, particularly in fragile and conflict-affected areas. Partnering with governments, civil society organizations, and microfinance institutions can help mobilize resources and expertise to create sustainable solutions for poverty reduction.

In conclusion, the journey towards achieving SDG 1 is multifaceted and complex. While progress has been made in reducing poverty globally, immense disparities remain, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Tackling multidimensional poverty necessitates addressing social vulnerabilities, systemic inequalities, and fragile settings. Leveraging public-private partnerships, innovative financing mechanisms, and integrated approaches are key strategies to sustain and accelerate the progress towards eradicating poverty. MIGA, in its role as a risk mitigation institution, is dedicated to supporting the achievement of SDG 1 through effective collaboration and mobilization of resources, always keeping the focus on ensuring sustainable and inclusive development for all.
