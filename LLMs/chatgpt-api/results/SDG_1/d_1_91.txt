Mrinal Chatterjee is a distinguished academician and expert in sustainable development. In this article, we will explore the first Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) which aims to "End poverty in all its forms everywhere" by 2030. This goal recognizes the multidimensional nature of poverty and seeks to address its root causes and redress structural inequalities around the world.

Poverty is a complex and multi-faceted issue that affects not only income levels but also access to basic services, opportunities for education, healthcare, clean water, quality housing, and social protection. The SDG 1 highlights the need to adopt a comprehensive and integrated approach to address poverty by tackling its economic, social, and environmental dimensions.

At the heart of SDG 1 is the principle of leaving no one behind. It emphasizes the importance of reaching the most vulnerable and marginalized populations who are often disproportionately affected by poverty. This includes women, children, indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities, and rural communities.

To achieve this goal, concerted efforts are needed at the national and global levels. Governments, international organizations, civil society, and private sector actors must work collaboratively to implement effective policies, mobilize resources, and foster inclusive development.

One of the key pathways to poverty eradication is economic development. Enhancing inclusive growth and decent employment opportunities can uplift individuals and families out of poverty. This requires investing in infrastructure, supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, promoting entrepreneurship, and providing access to financial services for all.

However, economic growth alone is not sufficient. Equally important is the creation of a supportive social safety net that ensures basic needs are met and protects individuals from falling into poverty during times of economic uncertainty or shocks. This includes policies such as cash-transfer programmes, employment guarantees, and affordable healthcare which provide buffers against poverty and improve individuals' resilience.

Education is another critical component of poverty reduction. Providing quality and inclusive education for all is key to breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty. It not only equips individuals with the necessary skills and knowledge to participate in the labor market but also empowers them to make informed decisions and contribute to the development of their communities.

Access to healthcare is also crucial in combating poverty. Universal health coverage ensures that everyone, regardless of their economic status, has access to essential health services without suffering financial hardship. It not only improves health outcomes but also protects individuals from the devastating economic consequences of illness.

Addressing poverty requires a holistic and integrated approach that also takes into account environmental sustainability. Climate change and environmental degradation disproportionately impact the poorest communities, exacerbating existing vulnerabilities and pushing people deeper into poverty. Therefore, efforts to eradicate poverty must be aligned with efforts to mitigate climate change and protect ecosystems.

One example of a cross-cutting initiative in tackling poverty is the promotion of renewable energy. Investing in clean and sustainable energy sources not only helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also expands access to modern energy services for communities living in poverty, providing them with opportunities for economic development and improved livelihoods.

In conclusion, SDG 1 underscores the importance of intensifying and coordinating efforts to end poverty in all its forms everywhere. Eradicating poverty requires broad-based measures that address the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of poverty. It calls for inclusive and sustainable development, leaving no one behind. By prioritizing poverty eradication, societies can create a more just and equitable world, where everyone has the opportunity to thrive and lead fulfilling lives.
