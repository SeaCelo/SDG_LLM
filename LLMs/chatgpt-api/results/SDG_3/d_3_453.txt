Introduction

WaterAid is pleased to present this detailed and analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 3 - Ensure Healthy Lives and Promote Well-Being for All at All Ages. As the leading global water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) organization, we have been working towards achieving this goal by  receiving universal access to safe and clean water and sanitation. This report aims to provide an expert audience with an in-depth understanding of the current status, key challenges, and potential interventions in pursuit of SDG 3.

Current Status and Challenges

Despite significant progress in improving global health outcomes, several challenges continue to hinder the achievement of SDG 3. One of the major challenges is the lack of access to basic sanitation facilities, which disproportionately affects vulnerable communities in low- and middle-income countries. According to the latest available data, an estimated 2.2 billion people still do not have access to safely managed sanitation services, leading to the spread of waterborne diseases and poor hygiene practices.

Another critical challenge is the lack of clean drinking water sources, particularly in rural areas. It is alarming that approximately 785 million people lack access to basic drinking water services, risking their health and well-being. Inadequate sanitation and hygiene also contribute to child mortality rates and infections caused by waterborne diseases.

Furthermore, the burden of diseases, including maternal and newborn mortality, persists in regions with limited access to quality healthcare facilities. Many developing countries face scarcity in healthcare infrastructure, skilled healthcare professionals, and affordable healthcare services, preventing communities from receiving the treatment and care they need.

Interventions and Strategies

To overcome these challenges and promote progress towards SDG 3, WaterAid advocates for comprehensive interventions and strategies focusing on three key areas: water, sanitation, and hygiene promotion. 

1. Water: Ensuring universal access to clean and safe water sources is essential for achieving SDG 3. WaterAid supports the development of sustainable water infrastructure systems, including the construction of wells, boreholes, rainwater harvesting systems, and piped water networks. Additionally, promoting water resource management and implementing purification technologies can strengthen water access and quality.

2. Sanitation: Investing in sanitation facilities is crucial for improving hygiene practices and reducing the incidence of waterborne diseases. WaterAid champions the implementation of sustainable sanitation solutions, such as building community toilets, upgrading or rehabilitating existing systems, and promoting innovative sewage management strategies, including fecal sludge management. Our approach involves working closely with governments and communities to ensure sustainable sanitation solutions are funded, implemented, and properly maintained.

3. Hygiene Promotion: Behavioral change communication campaigns play a vital role in improving hygiene practices. WaterAid actively engages communities at both the individual and institutional levels to promote proper handwashing with soap, menstrual hygiene management, and safe waste disposal practices. By focusing on health education and community-based systems, we strive to create sustainable behavior change and ensure the long-term adoption of healthy hygiene practices.

Cross-cutting Approaches and Partnerships

To maximize the impact and success of our interventions, WaterAid employs cross-cutting approaches and partnerships. We believe that addressing the interrelated nature of development challenges is crucial for creating transformative change.

1. Integration across SDGs: By recognizing the interconnectedness of various Sustainable Development Goals, WaterAid works towards integrating SDG 3 with other related goals, such as SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) and SDG 5 (Gender Equality). This approach leads to more comprehensive and coherent interventions that tackle multiple issues simultaneously.

2. Multisectoral Partnerships: WaterAid fosters collaborative partnerships with governments, international organizations, NGOs, and local communities to achieve SDG 3 aspirations. By joining forces and sharing resources, experience, and knowledge, we can amplify the impact of our interventions and drive progress towards universal access to quality healthcare, safe water, sanitation, and hygiene.

Conclusion

In conclusion, SDG 3 holds immense importance in transforming global health outcomes and promoting well-being for all. WaterAid, as a global leader in WASH, continues to strive for universal access to clean water, sanitation, and hygiene services. Mitigating challenges through comprehensive interventions, cross-cutting approaches, and collaborative partnerships remain key elements of our approach. By collectively addressing the urgent water, sanitation, and hygiene needs, we can move closer to a world where everyone lives with good health, dignity, and well-being at all ages.
