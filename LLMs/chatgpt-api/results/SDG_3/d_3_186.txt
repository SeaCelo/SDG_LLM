The Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3) focuses on ensuring healthy lives and promoting the well-being for all at all ages. It emphasizes the need for universal health coverage, improved access to healthcare services, and the reduction of major health risks. In this article, we will delve into the primary elements of SDG 3, its progress thus far, and the challenges ahead.

One of the key objectives of SDG 3 is to achieve universal health coverage (UHC). This means ensuring that all individuals and communities have access to quality healthcare services without suffering from financial hardship. UHC essentially encompasses a broad range of services, including preventive, curative, and palliative care, with a strong emphasis on primary healthcare. This is vital for addressing major health challenges and reducing health inequalities.

Several indicators have been set to track progress on UHC, such as the coverage of essential healthcare services, the share of out-of-pocket healthcare expenditure, and the availability of skilled healthcare professionals. These indicators help to measure the extent to which countries are taking steps towards achieving UHC.

In terms of progress, significant strides have been made since the SDGs were adopted in 2015. Many countries have made efforts to expand health coverage and improve service quality. For example, Rwanda drastically reduced maternal and child mortality rates by implementing a community-based health insurance scheme. Similarly, Thailand effectively established a universal healthcare system, ensuring that every citizen has access to essential healthcare services.

However, despite these success stories, several challenges still remain. One major hurdle is inadequate healthcare infrastructure and human resources in many low-income countries. This discrepancy limits the delivery of essential health services, particularly in rural areas. Furthermore, financial constraints and limited funding pose additional barriers to achieving universal health coverage globally.

Another significant challenge within SDG 3 is the rising burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in both developed and developing countries. NCDs such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, respiratory diseases, and diabetes account for the majority of deaths worldwide. Addressing these diseases requires not only scalable prevention strategies but also effective patient management and treatment options.

Tackling NCDs also pertains to reducing the impact of major health risks related to factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, and substance abuse. These are often driven by complex social, economic, and environmental determinants, necessitating comprehensive strategies that involve multiple sectors and stakeholders in order to achieve significant impact.

Furthermore, in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, SDG 3 has taken on even greater significance. The current global health crisis has exposed the vulnerabilities of healthcare systems globally and emphasized the need for preparedness and resilience against future pandemics. It has also highlighted the interlinkages between health and other SDGs such as poverty, inequality, and climate change.

In conclusion, SDG 3 plays a critical role in promoting and ensuring healthy lives for all. Universal health coverage and the reduction of major health risks are essential components to achieve this goal. Although progress has been made in expanding health coverage and addressing NCDs, challenges such as inadequate infrastructure, limited resources, and emerging health crises persist. Addressing these challenges requires a collaborative and comprehensive approach, involving governments, healthcare professionals, civil society, and international organizations. Only through concerted efforts can we realize the vision of healthy lives and well-being for all.
