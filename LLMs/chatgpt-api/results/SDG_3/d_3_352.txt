Introduction:
The Sustainable Development Goal 3 of the United Nations aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. It focuses on a wide range of health-related issues, including reducing maternal and child mortality, improving access to healthcare services, reducing the prevalence of non-communicable diseases, and achieving universal health coverage. This report, prepared by the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency (TIKA), will provide an analytical examination of the current status of SDG 3 in Turkey.

Maternal and Child Mortality:
Turkey has made significant progress in reducing maternal and child mortality rates, which are important indicators of a country's healthcare system. The maternal mortality ratio per 100,000 live births has dropped from 102 in 2000 to 17.4 in 2017. Similarly, over the same period, child mortality rates decreased from 38 deaths per 1000 live births to 9.4. These achievements demonstrate the effectiveness of various interventions such as promoting antenatal care, skilled birth attendance, and the provision of essential immunizations.

Access to Healthcare Services:
In order to improve access to healthcare services, the Turkish government has implemented various policies and programs. The country has seen a higher number of healthcare facilities with regular healthcare workers, including doctors and nurses, leading to increased access to care in remote areas. Turkey has also invested substantially in upgrading its healthcare infrastructure and equipping healthcare facilities with the necessary equipment. As a result, the number of hospital beds per 1,000 population increased from 2.5 in 2002 to 3.8 in 2019.

Prevalence of Non-Communicable Diseases:
Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are a significant challenge worldwide, and Turkey is no exception. The leading NCDs in the country include cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes. In response, Turkey has taken preventative measures, including healthier lifestyle campaigns, raising awareness about risk factors, and providing treatment and care for individuals with NCDs through increased investment in healthcare services. These initiatives have positively contributed to reducing premature deaths caused by NCDs and improving the population's overall health.

Universal Health Coverage:
Efforts to achieve universal health coverage in Turkey have been remarkable. The introduction of the Health Transformation Program in 2003 was a significant step towards improving the accessibility and quality of healthcare services for all citizens. Under this program, the government facilitated the establishment of family medicine centers across the country, ensured the inclusion of vulnerable populations in the Social Health Insurance system, and expanded the geographical coverage of healthcare services. This comprehensive approach has significantly increased health service coverage in Turkey and reduced disparities in access to healthcare.

Partnerships and Collaboration:
Turkey recognizes the importance of partnerships and collaboration to achieve SDG 3. The Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency has actively engaged in bilateral, regional, and international initiatives, such as technical assistance programs and knowledge sharing platforms. Turkey's experience and expertise in healthcare management and public health have been shared with other countries through cross-national collaborations, training programs, and exchange of best practices. Collaborative efforts have been instrumental in advancing healthcare systems across different regions and strengthening overall global health.

Conclusion:
Turkey has made substantial achievements in addressing SDG 3, which seeks to ensure healthy lives and well-being for all individuals. The country has made remarkable progress in reducing maternal and child mortality rates, improving access to healthcare services, combating non-communicable diseases, and promoting universal health coverage. These achievements are the product of proactive policies, investments, and collaborative efforts by the government and various stakeholders. However, challenges remain, particularly in addressing health disparities among different populations and addressing emerging health threats. Efforts should continue to build on the current successes to further improve public health outcomes and to contribute to the overall global health agenda.
