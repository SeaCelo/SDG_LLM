INTRODUCTION

The Small Alpine Kingdom of Liechtenstein, through its development agency, Liechtensteinische Entwicklungsdienst (LED), unveils this detailed analytical report focusing on Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3) â€“ "Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages." This report is specifically tailored for an expert audience, presenting a comprehensive analysis of the current state of SDG 3 and outlining the key challenges and opportunities Liechtenstein has identified to achieve its targets.

CURRENT STATE OF SDG 3

SDG 3 aims to ensure access to quality healthcare services, essential medicines, and promote well-being for all, regardless of age or socio-economic background. The baseline data indicated that significant progress has been made globally, as well as within Liechtenstein, towards achieving SDG 3. However, much remains to be done.

1. REDUCING MATERNAL AND CHILD MORTALITY

One of the key targets of SDG 3 is reducing global maternal mortality to less than 70 per 100,000 live births and neonatal mortality to 12 per 1,000 live births. Liechtenstein recognizes the importance of comprehensive healthcare systems and preventive measures to improve maternal and child health outcomes, such as efficient antenatal care, skilled birth attendance, and vaccination campaigns. While the country has already achieved low maternal and child mortality rates, continued investments in healthcare infrastructure and leveraging technological advancements remain crucial to sustain these achievements.

2. COMBATING INFECTIOUS DISEASES

SDG 3 aims to end major communicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis by 2030. Liechtenstein recognizes that improving access to essential medicines and strengthening healthcare systems are pivotal in combating infectious diseases. Our assistance programs have been focused on supporting the provision of affordable medicines and increasing healthcare workers' capacity to diagnose and treat these diseases through training initiatives. Nonetheless, challenges persist, especially in low-income countries, where access to healthcare services and medicine remains a barrier to successfully meeting this target.

3. UNIVERSAL HEALTH COVERAGE (UHC)

Achieving universal health coverage is a critical component of SDG 3. UHC entails ensuring that all individuals have access to needed quality healthcare services without suffering financial hardship. While Liechtenstein has already achieved high levels of healthcare coverage for its citizens, there is still room for improvement in addressing the affordability, accessibility, and quality of healthcare services for vulnerable populations. Embedding equity within healthcare systems is crucial to ensure that no one is left behind, and LED emphasizes the importance of supporting UHC efforts in our partner countries.

CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES 4. REDUCING AVOIDABLE NCDs

Another major contributor to SDG 3 is the reduction of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and mental health disorders. Liechtenstein recognizes the progressive increase in NCD prevalence globally, with long-term implications for health and economic development. Targeted interventions aimed at raising awareness, preventive measures, and early diagnosis and treatment are vital for mitigating the NCD burden. By enabling technology transfer, capacity-building initiatives, and tailored healthcare solutions, there is an opportunity for LED to contribute significantly towards addressing this challenge.

5. BUILDING RESILIENT HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS

In order to effectively respond to various health challenges, it is imperative to strengthen healthcare systems worldwide. Often, weak healthcare infrastructure, inadequate human resources, and fragile supply chains hamper the effort to ensure comprehensive health coverage. LED considers supporting its partners in enhancing health system resilience as a key priority. By assisting in strengthening healthcare workforce capacities, facilitating technology transfer for diagnostics and treating diseases, and promoting sustainable healthcare financing models, LED seeks to build resilient healthcare systems capable of addressing current and emerging health challenges effectively.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, SDG 3, while making considerable progress, still presents significant challenges that require immense efforts and collaboration from the global community. Liechtenstein stands committed to advancing SDG 3 through LED's assistance programs, focusing on improving maternal and child health, combatting infectious diseases, achieving universal health coverage, reducing NCDs, and building resilient healthcare systems. Although the journey towards achieving SDG 3 may be challenging, LED remains resolute in its dedication to promoting healthy lives and well-being for all, leaving no one behind. Together in partnership with likeminded organizations and experts, we can surmount these challenges and make significant strides towards shaping a healthier future for all.
