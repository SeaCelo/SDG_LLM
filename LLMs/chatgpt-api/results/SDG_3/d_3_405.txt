Introduction 

At the Center for Victims of Torture, we strive to promote and protect the health and well-being of those affected by torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. This report focuses on SDG 3, which aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. By examining the intersections of torture and human rights violations with the targets of this goal, we aim to provide an in-depth analysis for our expert audience.

Health and Torture 

Torture has severe health consequences for its victims, leading to physical, psychological, and social disorders. Physical injuries resulting from torture can be debilitating and sometimes fatal. Such injuries may include fractures, internal organ damage, traumatic brain injuries, and burns inflicted through methods such as beating, electrical shocks, or prolonged stress positions. Additionally, individuals who have experienced torture often suffer from psychological trauma and mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder.

This intersection of health and torture is recognized in Target 3.4 of SDG 3, which seeks to reduce premature mortality from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) by one-third through prevention and treatment. Victims of torture often face higher rates of NCDs due to the physical and psychological effects of their traumatic experiences. Therefore, it is crucial to address the specific healthcare needs of torture survivors, including providing access to appropriate medical care, mental health services, and psychosocial support.

Gender-Based Violence and Health 

Target 3.7 of SDG 3 focuses on universal access to sexual and reproductive healthcare services. For victims of torture, this target becomes particularly relevant, as gender-based violence is frequently perpetrated during torture. Female survivors often experience sexual mutilation, rape, forced pregnancies, and other forms of violence targeted at their reproductive functions.

Meeting this target requires addressing the specific sexual and reproductive health needs of torture survivors. It entails providing comprehensive reproductive healthcare services, including access to safe abortion, family planning, and prenatal care. Additionally, safe and supportive spaces should be established to address the trauma and emotional challenges associated with these forms of violence.

Health Inequality and Torture 

Target 3.8 of SDG 3 aims to achieve universal health coverage, including access to essential healthcare services and access to safe, effective, and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all. However, torture survivors often face barriers in accessing healthcare due to various factors, including discrimination, fear of retribution, and inadequate knowledge of available services.

Addressing health inequality for torture survivors involves ensuring that specialized treatment and rehabilitation services are accessible, affordable, and available to all. It also necessitates incorporating a human rights-based approach in healthcare systems to guarantee non-discriminatory and culturally sensitive services.

Strengthening Partnerships 

To achieve the targets of SDG 3 concerning torture survivors, it is essential to strengthen cross-sectoral partnerships. Collaboration between healthcare professionals, human rights activists, social workers, and legal aid providers can offer a comprehensive response to the health and human rights challenges faced by survivors.

Furthermore, collaboration with international bodies, such as the United Nations and the World Health Organization, is crucial for promoting best practices, knowledge-sharing, and lobbying for policy changes that acknowledge and prioritize the needs of torture survivors.

Conclusion 

SDG 3 provides a vital framework for addressing the health and well-being of individuals affected by torture. By ensuring access to appropriate healthcare, addressing gender-based violence, tackling health inequalities, and fostering partnerships, we can work towards a world where survivors of torture can heal and rebuild their lives. This report serves as a comprehensive analysis for our expert audience to better understand the complex interplay between torture and SDG 3 and guide effective interventions for lasting change.
