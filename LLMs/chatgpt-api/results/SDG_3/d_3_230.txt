Achieving Goal 3 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is crucial for improving the health and well-being of individuals worldwide. As the world grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic, the significance of SDG 3 has become even more apparent. In this article, I, Alan B. Krueger, will discuss the objectives, key targets, and imperatives of SDG 3, as well as the progress made thus far and the challenges ahead.

Goal 3, which is "Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages," encompasses a wide range of health issues including the reduction of maternal and child mortality, the prevention and treatment of communicable diseases, the promotion of mental health, and the realization of universal health coverage. The targets associated with this goal are extensive and comprehensive, necessitating concerted efforts from governments, healthcare providers, and the global community.

Progress has been made towards achieving some of the targets of SDG 3. Since the adoption of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 2000, there has been substantial improvement in maternal and child health, with global maternal mortality ratio dropping by 38% between 2000 and 2017. Infant and under-five mortality rates have also declined significantly during this period. Vaccination coverage has increased, leading to the eradication of diseases such as polio in several nations.

However, while progress has been notable, many challenges remain. In low-income countries, access to essential healthcare services remains limited, leading to preventable deaths and disability. Non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and diabetes, are on the rise and pose a significant burden on healthcare systems. Mental health has also gained recognition as a pressing issue, with mental disorders affecting millions worldwide.

Universal health coverage (UHC) is a central element of SDG 3. UHC aims to ensure that everyone has access to quality healthcare services without suffering financial hardship. Achieving UHC requires addressing structural gaps, training and retaining healthcare workers, and establishing robust healthcare financing systems. Furthermore, ensuring access to essential medicines and vaccines, as well as promoting affordable and equitable healthcare services, are key facets of UHC.

Another challenge facing SDG 3 is health inequalities. Despite global improvements, significant disparities in health outcomes persist across geographic locations and population groups. These disparities are influenced by factors such as socioeconomic status, gender, ethnicity, and disability. Tackling these inequalities requires targeted interventions and an inclusive approach to healthcare delivery.

In the context of COVID-19, SDG 3 takes on even more significance. The pandemic has highlighted the vulnerabilities and weaknesses in healthcare systems globally. The goal of ensuring that all countries have strong public health systems and access to essential healthcare services is imperative for pandemic preparedness and response. The COVID-19 crisis has shown that investing in resilient health infrastructure, prioritizing research, and bolstering healthcare workforce capacity are critical elements in achieving SDG 3.

In conclusion, SDG 3 plays a vital role in shaping the future of global health and well-being. Progress has been made in several areas, but challenges persist. Achieving universal health coverage, addressing health inequalities, and strengthening health systems are essential for advancing the objectives of this goal. The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the need for greater attention and investment in resilient health infrastructure. As we work towards SDG 3, it is imperative that governments, organizations, and individuals collaborate to build a healthier and more equitable world for all.
