Introduction

This report provides a detailed analysis of Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3) - ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages. Written by International Medical Relief, this report aims to analyze the current status of SDG 3 and highlight the progress, challenges, and future prospects of achieving this goal. The report is directed towards an expert audience, including policy-makers, researchers, and professionals in the field of healthcare and global development.

Overview of SDG 3 - Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages

SDG 3 encompasses a broad range of health-related challenges faced by nations worldwide. It explicitly recognizes the need for Good Health and Well-being, allowing people of all ages to lead healthy lives and access the necessary healthcare services. The target set for SDG 3 is to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all by 2030.

Progress

Significant progress has been made towards achieving SDG 3 targets over the past few years. Global maternal mortality ratios have decreased by nearly 38% between 2000 and 2017. Additionally, the under-five mortality rate declined from 93 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 39 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2019.

Access to quality healthcare services, especially in low-income countries, has significantly increased. The global coverage of essential health services has improved substantially, with an estimated 60% of essential health services being available in low-income countries in 2017, compared to 51% in 2000.

The battle against communicable diseases has also witnessed significant achievements. Malaria incidence and mortality rates have been reduced, with a 60% decrease in malaria cases between 2000 and 2015, leading to an estimated 6.2 million lives saved.

Challenges

Despite commendable achievements, several challenges hinder the progress towards the full realization of SDG 3. One major obstacle is the global disparity in healthcare access. Many low-income countries still struggle to provide basic healthcare services due to limited resources, weak healthcare infrastructure, and insufficient health financing. Inadequate access to quality healthcare hampers progress and widens the health inequalities gap between developed and developing nations.

Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) pose a persistent challenge to SDG 3. According to the World Health Organization, NCDs are responsible for 71% of all global deaths, with cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and chronic respiratory diseases being the leading causes. Addressing NCDs requires a holistic approach involving prevention, early detection, and affordable treatment options.

In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the challenges faced in achieving SDG 3. The health and socio-economic impacts of the pandemic have disrupted health systems, strained medical resources, and increased vulnerability among marginalized populations. Recovery efforts need to prioritize strengthening health systems to withstand future crises and ensure resilience.

Way Forward

To accelerate progress towards SDG 3, concerted efforts and strategic actions are required on multiple fronts. Priority must be given to strengthening healthcare systems, especially in low-income countries, through increased investment in infrastructure, human resources, and health financing. This includes enhancing primary healthcare services, particularly in rural and underserved areas.

Furthermore, a comprehensive approach to addressing NCDs should be adopted, focusing on factors such as population-wide prevention, early and affordable treatment, and improved surveillance systems. Collaborative initiatives involving governments, civil society organizations, and the private sector are crucial in tackling these challenges.

Highlighting the interlinkages between SDG 3 and other goals is essential. Health and well-being are interconnected with various sustainable development goals, including poverty eradication (SDG 1), quality education (SDG 4), gender equality (SDG 5), clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), and climate action (SDG 13). Integrated approaches, with a cross-sectoral focus, are vital for addressing the underlying determinants of health and achieving meaningful progress towards SDG 3.

Monitoring progress towards SDG 3 is equally important. Robust data collection, analysis, and monitoring systems are necessary to effectively measure progress, identify gaps, and guide evidence-based policies and interventions. Strengthening health information systems will provide accurate and timely data for better decision-making.

Conclusion

SDG 3 plays a pivotal role in building healthier societies and improving well-being for all. While commendable progress has been made in various health indicators, significant challenges remain. Achieving SDG 3 requires a collective global effort, placing health as a central tenet of sustainable development. By addressing the challenges, strengthening health systems, and adopting integrated approaches, we can ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.
