As a committed conservative pundit, Jonah Goldberg has long held the belief that government interventions and global agreements designed to address pressing international issues are often ineffective and counterproductive. Therefore, for him, the Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3) — ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages — is an example of a well-intentioned but flawed framework.

At first glance, the ambition and complexity of SDG 3 may seem admirable. It seeks to address a wide range of health-related challenges, including communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases, and the overall well-being of people across all age groups. Goldberg, however, contends that its implementation and subsequent outcomes could lead to unintended consequences and unwanted government intervention.

One of the core issues Goldberg highlights is the potential distortion of the healthcare market through SDG 3. By setting targets and indicators for countries to achieve, SDG 3 encourages governments to take on a more active role in regulating and providing healthcare services. In doing so, it risks stifling the innovative potential of the private sector, which has often proven to be more efficient and adaptable in addressing healthcare needs.

Goldberg warns against the risks of central planning that SDG 3 imposes by encouraging governments to fund and operate healthcare systems. He argues that such top-down approaches could lead to inefficiency, poor allocation of resources, and limited choice for individuals seeking healthcare services. Furthermore, while SDG 3 emphasizes the importance of universal health coverage, Goldberg is skeptical about the feasibility of achieving this goal without imposing additional burdens on taxpayers or undermining individual autonomy.

Another concern raised by Goldberg is the potential for SDG 3 to create a perverse incentive structure in the global health landscape. By prioritizing certain health issues and allocating resources to tackle them, SDG 3 may inadvertently divert attention and resources away from other vital but neglected health challenges. As governments and international organizations focus their efforts on meeting SDG 3 targets, other pressing health concerns, such as emerging infectious diseases or mental health, risk being overshadowed and deprived of much-needed attention and resources.

Additionally, Goldberg questions the underlying assumption that governments and global institutions have the capacity and knowledge to successfully design, implement, and monitor comprehensive healthcare systems. He suggests that history has shown that governments are often inefficient and ineffective in addressing complex societal issues. Instead, he posits that allowing the market to play a more significant role in healthcare delivery can foster competition, innovation, and greater access to care, ultimately improving overall health outcomes and promoting well-being.

Despite his concerns about SDG 3, Goldberg does acknowledge the importance of addressing health challenges and promoting well-being around the world. Nonetheless, he argues that the top-down approach of SDG 3 is not the most viable or effective means to achieve these goals. Rather, he advocates for empowering individuals and communities through market-based solutions, fostering innovation, and allowing for bottom-up approaches that are driven by local knowledge and problem-solving.

In conclusion, Jonah Goldberg's perspective on the Sustainable Development Goal 3 underscores his skepticism about the role of government in matters of healthcare and his belief in the power of market forces and personal agency. While recognizing the necessity of addressing health challenges, Goldberg argues that the SDG 3 framework endangers individual autonomy, stifles innovation, and distracts from neglected health issues. He presents an alternative vision centered around market-oriented approaches, local decision-making, and individual empowerment, which he believes could better promote health and well-being globally.
