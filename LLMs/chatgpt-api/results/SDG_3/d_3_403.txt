Introduction:

This analytical report aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of the current state of Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3) and its progress towards ensuring health and well-being for all at all ages. As an international humanitarian agency committed to advancing the principles of Catholic Social Teaching, Catholic Relief Services (CRS) has been actively involved in supporting communities and nations in achieving this ambitious goal.

Background:

SDG 3 aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all individuals, with a particular focus on reducing maternal and child mortality, combating communicable diseases, and achieving universal health coverage. This goal is deeply ingrained within the values and teachings of the Catholic Church in promoting human dignity and holistic well-being. CRS's expertise, knowledge, and on-ground experience have equipped them to tackle health-related challenges efficiently and effectively.

Progress and Challenges:

CRS acknowledges the progress made in achieving SDG 3 targets globally. The global under-five mortality rate and maternal mortality ratio has significantly decreased, and many communicable diseases have been successfully controlled or eradicated. However, several challenges persist in ensuring comprehensive healthcare and well-being for all.

1. Disparities in Access to Healthcare:
Significant disparities in access to healthcare still exist, both between and within countries. Marginalized populations such as refugees, migrants, and the urban poor often lack proper healthcare infrastructure, personnel, and financial resources. CRS has observed that addressing these disparities requires a multi-faceted approach, with a focus on improving healthcare infrastructure, ensuring healthcare personnel are adequately trained and equipped, and promoting equity in access to healthcare services.

2. Communicable Diseases:
While commendable progress has been made in reducing the incidence and prevalence of communicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, these diseases continue to pose significant challenges in many regions. For instance, the emergence of drug-resistant strains and weak healthcare systems in some countries demand urgent attention. CRS's wide network of partners and teams on the ground play a pivotal role in preventing and mitigating the spread of communicable diseases through education, prevention campaigns, treatment, and capacity-building efforts.

3. Strengthening Health Systems:
One critical aspect for achieving SDG 3 is the strengthening of health systems. Many countries, particularly those struggling with socio-economic fragility, witness weakened health systems due to underinvestment, insufficient healthcare facilities, and inadequate human resources. CRS supports governments and local partners in building strong health systems by assisting in capacity-building, improving infrastructure, supporting health worker training programs, and promoting collaborations within the health sector.

4. Non-Communicable Diseases:
The rise of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and diabetes continues to pose a significant health burden globally. The prevention and control of NCDs require a more comprehensive approach that integrates health promotion, policy changes, research, and partnerships. CRS advocates for holistic care approaches by encouraging healthy lifestyle practices, empowering communities to adopt preventive measures, and collaborating with local health organizations to enhance access to services for diagnosis and treatment.

Collaboration and Partnerships:

Achieving SDG 3 necessitates global collaboration between governmental and non-governmental organizations, civil society, faith-based institutions, and private sectors. CRS recognizes the significance of partnerships in mobilizing resources, expertise, and collective efforts to address health challenges effectively.

Conclusion:

Despite the progress achieved in advancing SDG 3, significant challenges persist. CRS remains committed to its mission of promoting health and well-being, guided by Catholic Social Teaching, and working hand in hand with local communities to achieve SDG 3 targets. By strengthening healthcare systems, addressing disparities, combating communicable diseases, and promoting comprehensive and holistic care, CRS aims to contribute positively to global efforts in realizing the vision of SDG 3.
