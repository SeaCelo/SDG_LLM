Introduction
The Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3) seeks to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. This article explores the key components, challenges, and strategies involved in achieving this goal. It outlines the importance of health as the foundation for sustainable development and highlights the interlinkages between health and other development sectors.

Scaling up healthcare services
One of the core targets of SDG 3 is achieving universal health coverage (UHC), which aims to ensure that everyone, irrespective of their socio-economic status, has access to affordable and quality healthcare services. This is essential for achieving good health outcomes and reducing the burden of preventable illnesses. To achieve UHC, countries must strengthen their healthcare systems, improve access to essential healthcare services, widen health insurance coverage, and address financial barriers that hinder access to care.

Building resilient healthcare systems
Resilient healthcare systems are crucial for responding effectively to disease outbreaks, natural disasters, and other public health emergencies. They are designed to provide healthcare services even in challenging and high-stress situations, ensuring that populations receive continued healthcare access during crises. The COVID-19 pandemic was a wake-up call, underscoring the importance of investing in resilient healthcare infrastructure, healthcare workforce, and health information systems. Additionally, integration of primary healthcare with disease surveillance and emergency response systems is crucial for ensuring effective and timely health interventions.

Improving maternal and child health
Reducing maternal and child mortality remains a key priority under SDG 3. Although significant progress has been made in recent years, disparities in maternal and child health outcomes still persist, particularly among marginalized communities. Strengthening maternal and child health services, including access to skilled birth attendants, antenatal and postnatal care, and immunization services, is essential. Additionally, empowering women and girls and promoting gender equality are fundamental to address systemic barriers that limit access to quality maternal and child health services.

Combatting infectious diseases
The fight against infectious diseases remains crucial for achieving SDG 3. Though significant strides have been made in controlling diseases like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, emerging infectious diseases continue to pose global threats. Strengthening disease surveillance, improving diagnostic capacity, promoting research and development of innovative treatments and vaccines, and enhancing global cooperation are essential elements in achieving sustained progress. Additionally, addressing antimicrobial resistance and promoting strong health systems can ensure effective management of emerging and re-emerging diseases.

Promoting mental health and well-being
Mental health is an integral part of overall well-being, yet it often remains overlooked in public health agendas. Promoting mental health, preventing mental disorders, and ensuring access to mental health services are vital for achieving SDG 3. Governments need to invest in mental health services, raise awareness, reduce stigma, and integrate mental health into primary healthcare settings. Additionally, creating supportive environments, promoting social inclusion, and addressing social determinants of mental health can have a lasting impact on mental well-being.

Addressing non-communicable diseases
Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and respiratory diseases pose a significant burden globally. SDG 3 calls for intensified efforts to reduce premature mortality from NCDs through prevention, early detection, and treatment. Implementing effective interventions, such as reducing tobacco and alcohol consumption, promoting healthy diets and physical activity, and providing access to affordable and equitable healthcare, can substantially reduce the burden of NCDs. 

Conclusion
Attaining SDG 3 is at the heart of sustainable development, as health is not only a fundamental human right but also a prerequisite for economic growth, poverty reduction, and social cohesion. Achieving universal health coverage, building resilient healthcare systems, addressing health inequalities, combatting infectious diseases, promoting mental health, and addressing non-communicable diseases are key pillars in advancing SDG 3. Governments, international organizations, civil society, and other stakeholders must work together to ensure that efforts are sustained and progress is accelerated towards a healthier and more equitable world for all.
