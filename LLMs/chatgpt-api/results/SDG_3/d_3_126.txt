The Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3) is focused on ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages. Its objective is to ensure universal access to healthcare services, reduce mortality rates, and combat widespread diseases. In this article, we will delve into the various aspects covered by SDG 3 and discuss the challenges and progress made toward achieving its targets.

Firstly, the universal access to healthcare services is a fundamental aspect of SDG 3. The goal is to ensure that everyone has access to affordable and quality healthcare, including essential medicines and vaccines. This is crucial to not only reduce mortality rates but also to improve the overall health outcomes of individuals. In order to achieve this, there is a need for increased investment in healthcare infrastructure, trained healthcare professionals, and affordable healthcare systems. Governments, international organizations, and other stakeholders must work together to develop policies and initiatives that focus on providing universal healthcare coverage.

Secondly, SDG 3 addresses the need to reduce mortality rates, particularly maternal and child mortality. The goal is to achieve a global maternal mortality ratio of less than 70 per 100,000 live births and a global under-five mortality rate of fewer than 25 per 1,000 live births. In order to achieve these targets, it is crucial to improve access to skilled healthcare professionals, including midwives, and promote safe birthing practices. Additionally, there is a need to focus on nutritional interventions, immunizations, and preventive care to ensure the healthy development of children and reduce child mortality rates.

Moreover, SDG 3 also emphasizes the need to combat widespread diseases and epidemics. This includes not only communicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria but also non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer. For communicable diseases, it is important to strengthen healthcare systems, improve access to diagnostics and treatments, and promote preventive measures such as safe sex practices and mosquito control. In order to address non-communicable diseases, there is a need for effective prevention strategies, early detection, and access to affordable and quality treatment options.

In terms of progress, there have been significant advancements in achieving the targets set by SDG 3. Efforts to improve healthcare infrastructure, strengthen healthcare systems, and increase access to healthcare services have contributed to improved health outcomes in many countries. For instance, the global maternal mortality ratio has declined by 38% since 2000, and the under-five mortality rate has declined by 58% during the same period. Additionally, significant progress has been made in combatting infectious diseases, such as reducing the prevalence of HIV/AIDS and malaria.

However, despite progress, there are challenges that need to be addressed in order to fully achieve SDG 3. One of the major challenges is ensuring equitable access to healthcare services. Disparities in access to healthcare exist both within and among countries. Marginalized populations, including women, rural communities, and vulnerable groups, often face barriers in accessing healthcare services. Addressing these disparities requires a comprehensive approach that focuses on addressing social determinants of health, promoting health equity, and improving healthcare coverage for all.

Another challenge is the rising burden of non-communicable diseases. These diseases are no longer confined to high-income countries but are increasingly affecting low- and middle-income countries as well. Preventing and managing non-communicable diseases requires a multi-sectoral approach, involving not only the healthcare sector but also other sectors such as education, agriculture, and urban planning. Additionally, there is a need for increased investment in research and development to develop innovative and effective interventions for the prevention and treatment of non-communicable diseases.

In conclusion, SDG 3 is a critical goal focused on improving global health outcomes and ensuring access to healthcare services for all. It addresses various aspects such as universal healthcare coverage, reducing mortality rates, and combatting widespread diseases. Although significant progress has been made, challenges remain, particularly in ensuring equitable access and addressing the rising burden of non-communicable diseases. To achieve SDG 3, global collaboration, increased investment, and multi-sectoral approaches are essential. By prioritizing and supporting initiatives related to SDG 3, we can foster a healthier and more inclusive future for all.
