INTRODUCTION
Despite significant advancements in global health, many middle-income countries still face numerous challenges in achieving universal health coverage and ensuring the well-being of their populations. This report, prepared by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), aims to provide an in-depth analysis of Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3) and its current progress within middle-income countries. SDG 3 entails ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages, and it encompasses a range of issues such as reducing maternal and child mortality, combating communicable diseases, and addressing non-communicable diseases.

1. CURRENT HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS AND ACCESSIBILITY
Middle-income countries exhibit a diverse range of healthcare systems, with varying levels of access to quality and affordable healthcare services. While some countries have achieved remarkable progress in healthcare delivery, others struggle with limited healthcare infrastructure and resources. It is essential to address the inequalities that exist within and between middle-income countries in terms of healthcare accessibility and affordability.

2. MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH
Reducing maternal and child mortality is a key target under SDG 3. Despite overall improvements, middle-income countries still experience higher maternal and child mortality rates compared to high-income countries. Analyzing the root causes of these disparities, such as inadequate access to quality prenatal care, skilled birth attendance, and essential health services, can assist policymakers in formulating targeted interventions. Strengthening health systems, improving maternal nutrition, and providing comprehensive reproductive healthcare are critical to achieving the targets of SDG 3.

3. COMBATING COMMUNICABLE DISEASES
Middle-income countries, while better positioned to handle communicable diseases than low-income countries, still face significant challenges in combatting infectious diseases. Factors such as inadequate surveillance systems, limited access to vaccines, and weak healthcare infrastructures contribute to the continued burden of communicable diseases. This necessitates increased investments in healthcare systems, promotion of immunization coverage, and the strengthening of disease surveillance networks to prevent outbreaks and epidemics.

4. NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES
The rising burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is a major concern within many middle-income countries. Factors such as sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy diets, and tobacco use contribute to the emergence and prevalence of NCDs. To address this, governments need to implement comprehensive strategies including health promotion and education programs, taxation on harmful products, and increased access to affordable healthcare services. Bridging the gap between prevention and treatment of NCDs is crucial for achieving the targets set in SDG 3.

5. MENTAL HEALTH
In recent years, there has been growing recognition of the importance of mental health as a global health issue. Middle-income countries, similar to other regions, face significant challenges in providing adequate mental healthcare services, addressing stigma, and promoting mental well-being. Integrating mental health services into primary healthcare systems, improving access to psychosocial support, and enhancing public awareness campaigns are crucial for reducing the burden of mental illness in these countries.

CONCLUSION
Middle-income countries play a vital role in the achievements of SDG 3, as they encompass a significant portion of the world's population. Enhancing healthcare systems, reducing maternal and child mortality, combating communicable and non-communicable diseases, as well as promoting mental health and well-being are critical to achieving the targets outlined in SDG 3. Middle-income countries must prioritize targeted investments in healthcare infrastructure, address systemic inequalities, and develop comprehensive health strategies to ensure the realization of universal health coverage and well-being for all. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) stands ready to collaborate with governments, development partners, and other stakeholders to support the implementation of SDG 3 in middle-income countries and foster sustainable human development.
