Introduction

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the current status of Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3), which focuses on ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages. The Asia-Pacific region, serviced by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), is the main focus of this report. SDG 3 encompasses a wide range of targets, including reducing the global maternal mortality ratio, ending preventable deaths of children under 5, promoting mental health, and combating non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cancer and diabetes.

Overview of SDG 3 in the Asia-Pacific Region

In the Asia-Pacific region, significant progress has been made towards achieving SDG 3, but challenges still remain. Maternal mortality, for example, has declined by nearly 50% since 2000, but is still higher than the global average. ESCAP has been actively working with member countries to address this issue and promote access to quality healthcare services for women during pregnancy and childbirth. However, more efforts are needed, particularly in remote and rural areas where healthcare facilities are often scarce.

Child mortality rates have also shown improvement, with a notable decrease in the number of preventable child deaths in recent years. Vaccination coverage, access to clean drinking water, improved sanitation facilities, and better nutrition have played key roles in this progress. ESCAP has been instrumental in facilitating regional collaboration on immunization programs and helping countries strengthen their health systems to ensure effective healthcare services reach every child.

Health Systems Strengthening and Universal Health Coverage (UHC)

To achieve SDG 3, a strong focus has been placed on strengthening health systems and promoting universal health coverage (UHC) in the region. UHC ensures that all individuals and communities have access to the quality services they need, including health promotion, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care. This not only contributes to achieving SDG 3 but also has spillover effects on other goals, such as reducing poverty and inequality.

ESCAP has been working closely with member countries to develop robust health systems that are resilient, well-funded, and accessible to all. This involves improving healthcare infrastructure, increasing the number of well-trained health professionals, and addressing the social determinants of health. By strengthening health systems and promoting UHC, the region can ensure that no one is left behind and that health services are available to all, regardless of socio-economic status or geographical location.

Mental Health and Non-communicable Diseases

Mental health has emerged as a significant concern in the Asia-Pacific region, posing challenges to the achievement of SDG 3. ESCAP has been advocating for increased investment and enhanced policies to address mental health issues and reduce the stigma associated with mental illness. Collaborative efforts are underway to integrate mental health services into primary healthcare settings, promote awareness and understanding of mental health, and provide support to individuals and families affected by mental illness.

Additionally, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases have become major healthcare burdens in the region. ESCAP, in coordination with member countries, has been implementing initiatives to prevent and control NCDs, including tobacco and alcohol control measures, promoting healthy diets and physical activity, and strengthening healthcare systems to ensure effective treatment and management of NCDs.

Conclusion
Progress has been made in achieving SDG 3 in the Asia-Pacific region, but challenges remain. ESCAP, along with member countries, is actively working to address these challenges and promote the health and well-being of all individuals. Strengthening health systems, promoting UHC, addressing mental health, and combating NCDs are key priorities. By implementing targeted interventions and collaborating at regional and global levels, ESCAP aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being across the region, contributing to the overall achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.
