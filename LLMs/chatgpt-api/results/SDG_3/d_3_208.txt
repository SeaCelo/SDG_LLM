Health is a fundamental aspect of human well-being and a prerequisite for sustainable development. It is recognized as a universal human right by the United Nations, and the journey to achieve good health for all is at the core of Sustainable Development Goal 3 – “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.”

As a renowned economist with an interest in human development, I have taken a keen interest in exploring the interplay between health and socio-economic outcomes. My research has focused on the long-term impacts of early childhood health interventions and the economic implications of investing in health.

SDG 3 encompasses a wide range of targets that are crucial for improving global health, addressing disparities, and reducing premature deaths from preventable causes. Some of the key targets of SDG 3 include reducing the global maternal mortality ratio, ending preventable deaths of newborns and children under five, combating major infectious diseases, achieving universal health coverage, and promoting mental health and well-being.

Achieving these targets requires a multi-faceted approach that goes beyond the traditional healthcare sector. While access to quality healthcare services undoubtedly plays a central role, addressing the social determinants of health, such as education, employment, housing, and access to clean water and sanitation, are equally important. 

Investing in early childhood health has emerged as a powerful strategy to tackle health inequalities and promote lifelong well-being. The evidence base for the economic returns of early health interventions is strong, with several well-designed studies showing the long-term positive impacts on both individual and societal outcomes. For instance, early childhood health interventions have been found to improve cognitive and non-cognitive skills, increase educational attainment, reduce criminal involvement, and enhance economic productivity in adulthood.

Universal health coverage is another pivotal aspect of SDG 3. Health is a public good, and no one should be left behind or face financial hardship due to medical reasons. It is essential to strengthen health systems, ensure affordable and equitable access to essential health services, and provide financial risk protection to individuals. By investing in universal health coverage, we can enhance resilience against epidemics, promote healthier societies, and contribute to overall economic growth.

The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the urgency and relevance of SDG 3. It has exposed existing gaps in healthcare systems and disparities in health outcomes across regions and socioeconomic groups. The pandemic has also placed a significant strain on mental health, highlighting the need to prioritize mental well-being as an integral part of the agenda.

As we move forward in implementing SDG 3, it is crucial to recognize the intersectionality between health and other sustainable development goals. Health influences and is influenced by a multitude of factors, such as education, gender equality, poverty eradication, environmental sustainability, and more. By adopting a holistic and interconnected approach, we can maximize the synergies across different goals and achieve sustainable development in its entirety.

In conclusion, SDG 3 aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all. From reducing maternal and child mortality to combating major infectious diseases, from promoting mental health to achieving universal health coverage, SDG 3 comprehensively addresses the multifaceted aspects of health. By investing in early childhood health, strengthening health systems, and addressing the social determinants of health, we can pave the way for a healthier, more equitable, and sustainable world. As economists, policymakers, researchers, and advocates, it is our collective responsibility to embrace the principles of SDG 3 and work towards the realization of this important agenda.
