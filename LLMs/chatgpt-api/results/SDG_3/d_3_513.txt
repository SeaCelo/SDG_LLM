Title: Examining Indicators and Policies to Attain Sustainable Development Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being

Abstract:
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have been envisioned as a roadmap towards a sustainable future, addressing the most pressing economic, social, and environmental challenges faced by humanity. This article delves into the details of SDG 3, focusing on the goal of ensuring good health and promoting well-being for all. Through an analysis of the key indicators and pertinent policies, this study provides insights into the measures needed to achieve the targets set under SDG 3.

Introduction:
Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3) aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all, across all ages and walks of life. It recognizes the need for equitable access to quality healthcare services, the eradication of diseases, and the improvement of mental health. This comprehensive goal encompasses a broad spectrum of health-related challenges in developed and developing countries alike.

Indicators and Targets:
Under SDG 3, several key health indicators and targets have been identified to gauge progress and redirect policy efforts. These indicators include maternal mortality ratio, under-five mortality rate, mortality rate due to non-communicable diseases, contraceptive prevalence rate, and proportion of the population with access to basic healthcare services. 

Progress and Challenges:
Despite ongoing efforts, the global health landscape is rife with challenges. Maternal and child mortality, although decreasing, remain significant concerns in many parts of the world, particularly in developing regions. The prevalence of non-communicable diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's Diseases is on the rise. Mental health, notably depression, remains a major concern globally. Access to affordable, quality healthcare services is not evenly distributed, exacerbating these issues further.

Addressing the Challenges:
To effectively address these challenges and achieve the targets set forth under SDG 3, a multifaceted approach is required. This includes strengthening healthcare systems, investing in research and development, promoting universal health coverage, enhancing health promotion and disease prevention strategies, and tackling underlying social determinants of health. Moreover, policymakers need to tackle gender disparities and ensure a gender-sensitive approach across all health interventions.

Health Financing for SDG 3:
Financing SDG 3 is paramount as it requires substantial investments to strengthen health systems, improve healthcare infrastructure, and foster innovative research. While external aid and assistance are crucial, offering short-term relief, sustainable financing mechanisms must be established. This requires a balanced portfolio that includes domestic resource mobilization, private sector engagement, innovative financing models, and international cooperation.

Multi-sectoral Collaboration:
Achieving SDG 3 necessitates strong collaboration between sectors such as health, education, environment, and economic development. By adopting a comprehensive, integrated approach, policymakers can mitigate the factors that contribute to health inequalities and promote sustainable health outcomes. Engaging and coordinating efforts across various stakeholders including governments, civil society, and the private sector is of paramount importance.

Conclusion:
SDG 3 is an ambitious and crucial goal at the heart of the global development agenda. Addressing the health challenges faced by societies worldwide requires sustained commitment, innovative approaches, and concerted efforts on multiple fronts. Tackling the underlying causes of health disparities, investing in comprehensive healthcare systems, and promoting equitable access to quality healthcare services are essential steps towards achieving good health and well-being for all. The Journal of Public Economics holds significance in fostering continued research and analysis in this field, contributing to evidence-based policymaking and ultimately bridging the gap between goals and realities.
