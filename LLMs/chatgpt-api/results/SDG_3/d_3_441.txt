Introduction:

Save the Children has undertaken an in-depth analysis of SDG 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. The aim of this report is to critically examine the progress made towards achieving this goal, identify challenges, highlight best practices, and propose recommendations for future action. This analysis is intended for an expert audience who seeks a comprehensive understanding of SDG 3 and its impact.

Current Progress and Challenges:

SDG 3 addresses critical health issues such as maternal and child mortality, infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases, mental health, and universal healthcare coverage. While significant strides have been made since the adoption of the SDGs, substantial challenges remain.

Maternal and child mortality has declined globally, thanks to improved access to healthcare and interventions like immunization and antenatal care. However, progress has been uneven across regions, with Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia still experiencing alarmingly high rates.

The burden of infectious diseases in low-income countries remains a significant challenge. Despite notable achievements in controlling diseases like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, outbreaks and emerging infectious diseases continue to pose significant threats. Achieving universal access to vaccines and strengthening healthcare systems are essential to address these challenges.

Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are increasingly becoming the leading cause of death worldwide. Diseases like cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and diabetes are on the rise, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Limited access to affordable healthcare, inadequate prevention strategies, and unregulated marketing of unhealthy products contribute to the increasing burden of NCDs.

Mental health has gained recognition as a crucial aspect of overall well-being. However, stigma, limited resources, and dearth of mental health services hinder progress towards mental health for all. Addressing mental health needs requires increased investments, integrated approaches, and community participation.

Universal healthcare coverage (UHC) is a foundational principle of SDG 3, aiming to ensure that everyone, regardless of income or location, has access to essential health services. Achieving UHC is a complex task, as several factors influence healthcare access, including funding, systems strengthening, addressing health workforce shortages, and reducing out-of-pocket expenses. A rights-based approach to healthcare provision is crucial to leave no one behind.

Best Practices and Case Studies:

Several countries have demonstrated exemplary progress in implementing interventions that contribute to achieving SDG 3.

1. Rwanda's healthcare system has made impressive gains since the devastating genocide in 1994. The government prioritized primary healthcare, invested in community health workers, and improved infrastructure and services. As a result, the country achieved substantial reductions in maternal and child mortality and increased access to essential health services.

2. Brazil's successful response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic through a comprehensive approach, including prevention strategies, treatment availability, community involvement, and shared responsibility between government and civil society, serves as a model for effectively tackling infectious diseases.

3. Thailand's approach to achieving universal healthcare coverage is commendable. Through strategic investments in health infrastructure, strengthened human resources, and financial protection mechanisms, Thailand significantly expanded access to quality healthcare services across the population.

Recommendations:

To accelerate progress towards achieving SDG 3, Save the Children puts forth the following recommendations:

1. Increase funding and resource allocation to prioritize essential health services, with an emphasis on marginalized populations and disadvantaged areas.

2. Strengthen health systems by investing in health workforce training and retention, improving infrastructure, and ensuring effective supply chain management.

3. Strengthen primary healthcare, including increasing access to preventive services, promoting community engagement, and integrating mental health services.

4. Promote multi-sectoral collaboration and partnerships to address the social determinants of health, such as poverty, education, and gender inequality.

5. Implement targeted interventions to prevent, control, and treat non-communicable diseases, with a focus on reducing risk factors and improving early detection and treatment.

6. Ensure the availability, affordability, and accessibility of medicines, vaccines, and essential health commodities, through price regulation, technology transfer, and innovation.

Conclusion:

While progress has been made towards ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being, considerable challenges still obstruct the realization of SDG 3. Building on best practices and learning from successful case studies, it is imperative for governments, civil society, and the international community to scale up efforts, increase investments, and collectively work towards achieving SDG 3, leaving no one behind and guaranteeing health and well-being for all at all ages. Save the Children remains committed to supporting these endeavors and collaborating with stakeholders to advance the agenda of SDG 3.
