The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were established by the United Nations Member States in 2015 as a comprehensive framework to address a broad range of economic, social, and environmental challenges facing our world. SDG 3 specifically focuses on ensuring healthy lives and promoting wellbeing for all at all ages.

In this article, we will explore the various targets of SDG 3 and delve into some of the key issues that the goal seeks to address. One of the main aims of SDG 3 is to reduce global maternal mortality and end preventable deaths of newborns and children under five years of age. Currently, maternal mortality rates vary significantly between different regions, with Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia accounting for the highest rates. To address this, SDG 3 aims to ensure access to quality reproductive healthcare services, including skilled birth attendants, for all women. This includes improving access to family planning services and reducing the unmet need for contraception, as well as ensuring safe and equitable access to abortion, where legally permitted.

Moving beyond maternal and child health, SDG 3 also tackles other major health issues such as communicable diseases. Target 3.3 of the SDG aims to end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and neglected tropical diseases by 2030. While significant progress has been made in the fight against these diseases, they continue to disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, particularly those in low-income countries. Achieving this target requires strengthening health systems, increasing funding for prevention and treatment, and improving access to medicines and vaccines.

Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are also an important element of SDG 3. These diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases, are responsible for the majority of deaths globally. SDG 3 targets the reduction of premature mortality from these NCDs by one-third through prevention and treatment strategies, as well as the promotion of mental health and wellbeing. To achieve this, an integrated approach is required, encompassing prevention, early detection, and timely treatment of NCDs. This entails not only investment in healthcare facilities and infrastructure, but also the promotion of healthy lifestyles, including tobacco control, reduction of harmful use of alcohol, and improved nutrition.

Furthermore, SDG 3 emphasizes the importance of achieving universal health coverage (UHC) to ensure that everyone has access to the healthcare services they need without experiencing financial hardship. UHC encompasses a range of services, including health promotion, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care. It requires strengthening health systems, improving human resources for health, and addressing health workforce shortages and geographical imbalances. Achieving UHC is not only crucial for health outcomes but also contributes to reducing poverty and inequality.

Lastly, SDG 3 highlights the need to strengthen the capacity of all countries, particularly developing countries, for early warning, risk reduction, and management of national and global health risks. This includes preparedness for disease outbreaks, strengthening of surveillance systems, and capacity building for research and innovation in health.

Overall, SDG 3 represents a comprehensive and ambitious agenda for promoting health and wellbeing worldwide. It recognizes the interconnectedness of various health issues and emphasizes the need for a multi-sectoral and integrated approach. Achieving the targets set out in SDG 3 requires global collaboration, political commitment, and sustained investment in healthcare systems and infrastructure. By prioritizing the health and wellbeing of all individuals, SDG 3 plays a pivotal role in the broader sustainable development agenda, contributing to poverty eradication, economic growth, social inclusion, and environmental sustainability.
