Timothy J. Besley, Professor of Economics and Political Science at the London School of Economics and Political Science, aimed to examine Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3) in his recently published academic article. In today's world, the importance of achieving good health and well-being for all cannot be overstated. SDG 3 focuses precisely on that objective. It calls for all nations, irrespective of their level of development, to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all, at all ages.

At its core, SDG 3 seeks to improve various aspects of human health, reduce mortality rates, increase access to health services, and promote mental well-being. This goal represents a global commitment to prioritize investment in health care systems, provide universal health coverage, and enhance research and development for health-related issues.

The first target of SDG 3 is to reduce the global maternal mortality ratio. Maternal mortality remains a pressing concern, primarily in developing regions. Several strategies, such as improving access to skilled health professionals during childbirth, ensuring access to reproductive health information and services, and addressing the underlying causes of maternal mortality, are critical for achieving this target. Moreover, investing in health infrastructure and strengthening healthcare systems can help alleviate this issue.

Another target is to end preventable deaths of newborns and children under the age of five. Despite commendable progress in reducing child mortality rates globally, concerted efforts are still needed to ensure that this target becomes a reality. Expanding immunization coverage, enhancing access to essential medicines, strengthening primary healthcare systems, and promoting community-based newborn care are some key strategies to ensure child well-being and reduce preventable deaths.

Addressing non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is an additional aspect that SDG 3 heavily focuses on. NCDs, including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases, are among the leading causes of death worldwide and have a significant economic burden on communities and individuals. Promoting healthy lifestyles, providing universal access to affordable healthcare services, and implementing measures to reduce the risks associated with NCDs are crucial for achieving this target.

Moreover, SDG 3 sheds light on the importance of mental health and well-being. Mental health conditions, ranging from anxiety and depression to severe psychiatric disorders, affect millions of people globally. This goal aims to promote mental well-being and significantly reduce the burden of mental health disorders. Investment in mental health services, raising awareness, and addressing stigma and discrimination surrounding mental health are steps in the right direction.

Achieving the targets of SDG 3 requires substantial commitment and collaboration from various stakeholders, including governments, civil society organizations, the private sector, and international partners. Adequate funding, innovation in healthcare technology, and the provision of healthcare education and training are crucial components in achieving lasting improvements in this area.

Furthermore, SDG 3 intersects with other goals such as SDG 1 (No Poverty), SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 5 (Gender Equality), and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities). Health and well-being are fundamental prerequisites for fighting poverty, achieving food security, empowering women, and reducing inequalities within and between countries. Therefore, alignment of efforts and integrated approaches are essential for maximizing impact and accelerating progress towards achieving these interrelated objectives.

In conclusion, SDG 3 underscores the overarching need for societies to prioritize health and well-being as a fundamental human right. Improving health outcomes and ensuring universal access to quality healthcare services are critical for sustainable development. By investing in health infrastructure, expanding access to essential medicines, addressing maternal and child health, combating NCDs, and promoting mental well-being, we can make significant progress towards this goal. Recognizing the interlinkages between health and other Sustainable Development Goals is vital for initiating effective and inclusive interventions. Through collaborative action and sustained commitment, we can strive towards a world where good health and well-being are universally upheld.
