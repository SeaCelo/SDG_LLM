The Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3) focuses on ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages. This goal is of significant importance due to the interdependencies between health and development. As the journal Organization Science, we aim to shed light on the ways in which organizations can contribute to the achievement of SDG 3.

One crucial aspect of SDG 3 is ensuring access to quality healthcare services for all. This includes both preventive and curative healthcare, as well as reproductive and sexual health services. Organizations play a vital role in bridging the healthcare gap, particularly in low-income communities where access to healthcare remains a challenge. By partnering with governments and non-governmental organizations, businesses can contribute to building sustainable and resilient healthcare systems.

Businesses can also integrate the principles of well-being into their organizational cultures and practices. This involves prioritizing the physical, mental, and emotional well-being of employees. Adopting workplace wellness programs, such as stress management initiatives, flexible work arrangements, and promoting work-life balance, can positively impact employee health and productivity. Organizations that prioritize employee well-being experience reduced turnover rates and increased job satisfaction, creating a healthier and more engaged workforce.

Another critical facet of SDG 3 is addressing public health challenges, including communicable and non-communicable diseases. Organizations can leverage their resources, capabilities, and expertise to collaborate and support public health initiatives. For instance, businesses can actively participate in public-private partnerships to develop and implement disease surveillance systems, improve access to vaccines, and promote research and development for new treatments.

Furthermore, organizations can contribute to building resilient health systems, particularly in regions prone to emergencies and disasters. By investing in infrastructure and healthcare services, businesses can ensure timely response and recovery efforts during times of crisis. For example, providing financial support to build or upgrade healthcare facilities, training healthcare workers, and investing in medical technology can contribute to a more effective and resilient health system.

However, it is important to note that achieving SDG 3 requires addressing various systemic challenges. In some parts of the world, healthcare is limited by access, affordability, and quality. Organizations can support efforts to increase healthcare access through innovative delivery models, such as telemedicine, mobile clinics, and community health workers. Additionally, addressing health disparities among different population groups, such as women, children, and vulnerable communities, is essential to ensure the progressive realization of SDG 3.

In conclusion, SDG 3 is a critical global goal that necessitates contribution and collaboration from various stakeholders, including organizations. By aligning their practices, strategies, and resources with the principles of SDG 3, businesses can play a pivotal role in advancing global health and well-being. Through partnerships, investment, and innovation, organizations can help build sustainable and resilient healthcare systems, promote employee well-being, respond to public health challenges, and improve access to quality healthcare for all. The responsibility falls upon organizations to contribute to the attainment of SDG 3, fostering a healthier and more equitable world for future generations.
