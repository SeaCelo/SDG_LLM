Introduction:
The Palestinian International Cooperation Agency (PICA) is pleased to present to you an engaging and in-depth analytical report on the progress and challenges related to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3: Good Health and Well-being. As an agency focused on promoting Palestinian interests in the international arena, PTCA actively engages in various aspects of the SDGs and aims to discuss the current status and way forward for SDG 3. This report targets an expert audience comprises academic and policy experts, researchers, and relevant stakeholders interested in the field of global health.

Background:
SDG 3 seeks to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. PICA recognizes the significance of this goal in addressing health inequalities and recognizes the integral role played by health, directly and indirectly, in sustainable development. The goal encompasses several targets, ranging from reducing maternal and child mortality to combating non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive healthcare services.

Progress and Challenges:

1. Maternal and Child Health:
Despite commendable efforts, Palestine continues to face challenges in reducing maternal and child mortality rates. There have been notable improvements in access to antenatal and postnatal care, as witnessed by the decline in maternal mortality rates. However, further action is required to enhance the quality and accessibility of healthcare facilities in remote areas, where pregnant women face limited access to essential services. Moreover, efforts to reduce child mortality face challenges stemming from political uncertainties, inadequate healthcare financing, and limited availability of specialized pediatric care.

2. Communicable Diseases:
Palestine faces a range of communicable diseases, including tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and hepatitis. While advancements have been made in disease surveillance, prevention, and treatment, sustainable gains are hindered by existing socioeconomic disparities and restricted mobility due to occupation. Addressing these challenges requires enhanced collaboration and resource allocation to strengthen healthcare systems, improve diagnostic capacities, and ensure equitable access to preventive measures and treatment.

3. Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs):
The prevalence of NCDs, such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, is on the rise in Palestine. Socioeconomic factors, coupled with lifestyle changes, contribute to this increase. Despite progress in raising awareness and implementing preventive measures, more comprehensive efforts are required to address risk factors, promote healthy lifestyles, and ensure the availability of affordable treatment options. Strengthening healthcare infrastructure, health promotion activities, and incorporating NCDs into primary healthcare plans are crucial steps towards achieving SDG 3 targets in this area.

4. Mental Health:
Palestine, like many countries, faces an increasing burden of mental health disorders, aggravated by protracted conflict and external stressors. Accessible and specialized mental healthcare services, including counseling programs, remain essential. Integrating mental health into primary healthcare settings, establishing strong community support systems, and breaking social stigmas are vital steps forward in this domain.

5. Universal Health Coverage (UHC):
Universal Health Coverage plays a pivotal role in achieving SDG 3. In Palestine, challenges related to healthcare financing and health insurance coverage hinder progress towards UHC. Addressing these challenges necessitates multiple strategies, including strengthening health service delivery models, improving health financing mechanisms, and enhancing governance structures for health system management.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, although Palestine has made strides in attaining SDG 3 targets, significant challenges persist that require immediate attention. Overcoming inequalities in access to healthcare services, resource limitations, political obstacles, and the impact of prolonged conflict demand collective efforts from both the international community and local leaders. PICA reiterates its commitment to advancing SDG 3 and invites stakeholders to join hands in addressing the complex health-related challenges that Palestine faces. By pursuing targeted interventions, ensuring multisectoral collaboration, and delivering sustainable healthcare solutions, we can foster healthier lives and nurture overall well-being in Palestine.
