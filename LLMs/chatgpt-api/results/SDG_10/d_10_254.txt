Sustainable Development Goal 10 (SDG 10) focuses on reducing inequality within and among countries. As an economist and a researcher deeply concerned about the rise of inequality, I wholeheartedly support the objectives outlined in SDG 10, as they align with my own research findings.

In recent decades, we have witnessed a significant increase in income and wealth inequality across the globe. The gap between the rich and the poor has widened, hindering not only economic growth but also social cohesion and stability. Recognizing this alarming trend, policymakers and academics alike have turned their attention to addressing this pressing issue.

SDG 10 sets out to promote income growth for the bottom 40 percent of the population, as well as reduce inequalities based on race, ethnicity, gender, age, disability, and socioeconomic status. These goals are not only morally imperative but also crucial for sustainable development. Research has consistently shown that countries with more equal income distribution tend to experience higher and more sustainable economic growth over the long run.

To effectively tackle inequality, SDG 10 calls for the implementation of fiscal, wage, and social protection policies that promote inclusivity. In particular, it emphasizes the importance of progressive taxation to redistribute income and prevent the accumulation of wealth in the hands of a few. This is an area where my own research comes into play.

Numerous studies, including my own, have highlighted the positive impacts of progressive taxation on income inequality. By taxing the wealthy proportionally higher, governments can redistribute resources to support the most vulnerable in society. This not only addresses the immediate issues of poverty and inequality but also helps to level the economic playing field, enabling individuals from all backgrounds to have equal opportunities for upward mobility.

In addition to progressive taxation, SDG 10 emphasizes the need for countries to implement and strengthen social protection measures. Access to healthcare, education, and social assistance programs is crucial for creating a more equal society. These safety nets not only buffer individuals from economic shocks but also help break the cycle of poverty, allowing individuals to invest in their human capital and contribute to economic growth.

While the goals and targets outlined in SDG 10 are commendable, it is important to acknowledge that achieving them will not be an easy feat. Structural factors, such as technological change and globalization, have contributed to the growth of inequality in recent decades. It is essential to take a comprehensive approach that addresses these underlying factors and systemic issues that perpetuate inequality.

Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed and exacerbated existing inequalities, with vulnerable populations being disproportionately affected by the health and economic fallout. Efforts to reduce inequality must be intensified in the face of this crisis, ensuring that the most vulnerable are prioritized in recovery efforts.

In conclusion, SDG 10 plays a critical role in striving for a more equitable world. By addressing income and wealth inequalities and promoting social inclusion, economic growth can become more sustainable and societies more harmonious. As an economist committed to finding solutions to the inequality crisis, I fully support the objectives outlined in SDG 10 and believe that through collective action and strong policy reforms, we can build a more prosperous and fair society for all.
