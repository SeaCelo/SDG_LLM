Inequality is an issue that affects economies and societies across the globe. Recognizing this, the United Nations set forth the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, with the aim of eradicating poverty, protecting the planet, and creating a more equitable world. Each of the 17 goals addresses various sustainability challenges, but in this piece, we will shed light on SDG 10: Reducing Inequalities.

SDG 10 sets out to tackle inequality in income, gender, and social disparities, with the ultimate goal of promoting inclusive economic growth. It acknowledges that unchecked inequality can hinder sustainable development and perpetuate poverty, while also posing risks to social cohesion and stability. The targets it aims to achieve by 2030 require comprehensive interventions in economic, political, and societal systems to create fair opportunities for all.

One crucial aspect tackled by SDG 10 is income inequality. This goal calls for policies that promote income growth for the bottom 40% of the population at a rate higher than the national average. Encouraging enterprises to adopt sustainable practices, closing the wage gap, and promoting fair taxation are crucial steps to ensure that prosperity reaches all segments of society. This not only supports economic development but also promotes inclusive social policies that can reduce poverty rates.

Another significant area of focus within SDG 10 is gender inequality. Women and girls often face systemic discrimination and unequal access to opportunities in various spheres of life, including education, employment, and political participation. The goal seeks to eliminate discriminatory practices and aims to ensure equal rights and opportunities for women and girls, along with promoting women's leadership in decision-making processes. Empowering women economically and politically can pave the way for a truly inclusive society and nurture a flourishing workforce.

SDG 10 also addresses inequalities related to social integration and opportunity. By advocating for the implementation of social policies informed by inclusiveness and social justice, the goal emphasizes fostering empowerment, inclusion, and participation for marginalized groups and communities. Efforts to eliminate discriminatory laws and practices, promoting universal access to basic services (including education, healthcare, and clean water), and prioritizing social protection measures all contribute to narrowing social disparities.

What makes SDG 10 unique is its recognition that inequalities are interconnected and reinforcing. While the eradication of poverty (SDG 1) is vital, it cannot be achieved in isolation from addressing inequalities. Furthermore, the fight against climate change (SDG 13) and protection of ecosystems are also closely tied to inequality reduction, as often marginalized groups bear the brunt of environmental degradation.

The private sector, governments, civil society organizations, and individuals all have a role to play in achieving SDG 10. Businesses can adopt fair employment practices, invest in training and education, and ensure that supply chains are free from exploitative labor conditions. Governments need to pass equitable legislation, create social safety nets, and reform tax policies to reduce wealth disparities. Civil society organizations provide a vital voice for marginalized communities and hold governments and businesses accountable. Lastly, individuals can contribute by supporting ethical businesses, challenging discriminatory practices, and reducing their own levels of consumption.

While progress has been made since the adoption of the SDGs in 2015, there is still much work to be done to achieve SDG 10 and create a more equitable world. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated inequality, pushing many people back into poverty and increasing disparities. Governments, businesses, and individuals must step up their efforts to ensure that the path towards economic, social, and environmental sustainability is paved with fairness and shared prosperity.

Ultimately, by addressing the root causes of inequality and working toward fair and inclusive societies, we can unlock the potential of every individual, foster economic growth, and create a world where opportunities are accessible by all, regardless of their background or circumstances. The path to achieving SDG 10 is ambitious, but with concerted efforts and a collective will, we can build a more equitable and prosperous future for all.
