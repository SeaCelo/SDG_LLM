In recent years, the issue of inequality has gained increasing attention on the global development agenda. Acknowledging the detrimental impact that inequality can have on societies, the United Nations has incorporated combating inequality as a distinct Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 10) under its 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. As one of the foremost economists studying poverty and inequality, I, Esther Duflo, fervently advocate for solutions that prioritize the reduction of inequality and social exclusion.

SDG 10 aims to "reduce inequality within and among countries" by focusing on various dimensions of inequality, including income inequality, social protection, access to basic services, and labor rights. By addressing these multifaceted aspects of inequality, SDG 10 aims to create more inclusive societies that ensure equal opportunities for all individuals, regardless of their background or circumstances.

Income inequality is an important concern that directly affects individuals' well-being and economic prospects. SDG 10 calls for policies that promote income growth for the bottom 40% of the population at a pace higher than the national average. This target recognizes the urgent need to reduce the income gap and uplift those who are economically marginalized. It necessitates a combination of economic policies such as progressive taxation, targeted cash transfers, and minimum wage regulations, among others.

However, monetary measures alone cannot eradicate inequality and ensure sustainable development. SDG 10, therefore, emphasizes the importance of social protection systems to mitigate the impact of inequalities across the life cycle. By promoting universal access to social security and extending social protection to all, the goal is to provide a safety net for the most vulnerable populations, including children, persons with disabilities, and the elderly. To ensure the effectiveness of social protection systems, it is crucial to tailor them to the specific needs and contexts of each country or region.

Access to quality basic services is another fundamental aspect of SDG 10. It is deeply concerning that millions of people still lack access to essential services such as education, healthcare, clean water, and sanitation. Addressing these inequalities requires increasing public investment in quality education and healthcare systems, ensuring equal access for marginalized groups. Prioritizing investments in infrastructure and technologies can facilitate access to clean water and sanitation for all, reducing inequalities in health outcomes and overall living standards.

Moreover, ensuring decent work and labor rights is vital for reducing inequality and achieving sustainable development. SDG 10 underscores the need to promote inclusive growth, enhance labor productivity, and protect labor rights for all workers, particularly those in the informal sector. Upholding labor standards and implementing equitable employment policies is crucial to address precarious work situations, reduce wage disparities, and ensure fair working conditions for all individuals.

While SDG 10 offers a comprehensive framework to tackle inequality, it is essential to evaluate progress and impact through robust monitoring systems and effective data collection. By analyzing disaggregated data, policymakers can better understand and address the specific challenges faced by different marginalized groups. This data-driven approach enables evidence-based policy design and intervention strategies, ensuring that no one is left behind on the path towards sustainable development.

In conclusion, SDG 10 positions equality at the center of the development agenda, recognizing the critical role it plays in building inclusive societies and sustainable futures. From addressing income inequality to expanding social protection systems, ensuring access to basic services, and protecting labor rights, SDG 10 provides a holistic approach to tackle the multidimensional nature of inequality. As we strive for a better and fairer world, it is imperative that we prioritize reducing inequality in both within and between countries, empowering individuals, and leaving no one behind on the journey towards sustainable development.
