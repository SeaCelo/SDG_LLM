The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were established by the United Nations in 2015 as a comprehensive framework to address the world's most pressing challenges and strive for a more just and sustainable future. SDG 10, specifically, aims to reduce inequalities both within and among countries. Looking through the lens of renowned economist Thomas Sowell, this article will delve into the intricacies of SDG 10, highlighting its background, targets, and implications.

One must first understand that Sowell's approach to economic and social issues is firmly anchored in the principles of classical liberalism. As a proponent of limited government intervention, he stresses the importance of individual liberty, free markets, and personal responsibility in driving economic growth and reducing disparities.

SDG 10 aligns with Sowell's framework, as its core aspirations include reducing income inequality, promoting social, economic, and political inclusion, and ensuring equal opportunities for all. These objectives are undoubtedly desirable, as no society can thrive if a significant portion of its population is marginalized or left behind. However, Sowell urges caution in relying heavily on government policies and interventions as the means to achieve these goals, as he argues that they can often have unintended consequences and hinder economic progress.

One target of SDG 10 is to progressively achieve and sustain income growth of the bottom 40% of the population at a rate higher than the national average. Sowell acknowledges the importance of lifting the poorest segments of society out of poverty, but he cautions against implementing redistributive policies that may stifle individual initiative and discourage wealth creation. Instead, he advocates for policies that foster economic growth and create opportunities for aspiring individuals to improve their own circumstances.

Another target of SDG 10 is to empower and promote the social, economic, and political inclusion of all, irrespective of age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion, or economic or other status. Sowell emphasizes the crucial role of equal rights and equal opportunity in a just society. However, he warns against relying solely on government interventions that might sacrifice meritocracy and undermine the principles of personal responsibility. Sowell argues that focus should be placed on eliminating systemic barriers and ensuring a level playing field rather than using heavy-handed redistributive policies that may distort the market.

Moreover, SDG 10 aims to ensure equal opportunity and reduce inequalities of outcome by adopting and implementing policies, such as fiscal, wage, and social protection policies, that progressively achieve greater equality. While Sowell acknowledges the importance of safety nets and social protection policies to support those in need, he questions the efficacy of extensive wealth redistribution and urges a cautious approach. He contends that policies like minimum wage laws might hinder job creation, discourage investment, and ultimately widen the income gap instead of reducing it.

In examining SDG 10 from Sowell's perspective, it is important to pause and reflect on his distinctive voice in the discourse on inequality. He believes that disparities between individuals and groups are an inherent reality due to differences in skills, talents, preferences, and choices. Sowell suggests that such disparities, while often unfortunate, are not inherently unjust or in need of rectification through aggressive redistribution.

In conclusion, SDG 10 addresses an important area of concern for global development by aiming to reduce inequalities within and among countries. Approaching this complex issue through the lens of Thomas Sowell brings to light the importance of preserving individual liberty, free markets, and personal responsibility in seeking solutions to inequality. Examining the goals and targets of SDG 10 within Sowell's paradigm invites a critical evaluation of the means through which inequalities are redressed and encourages a focus on policies that support economic growth, equal opportunity, and individual empowerment.
