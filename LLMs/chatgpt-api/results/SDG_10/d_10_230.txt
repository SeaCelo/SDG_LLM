Scholars and policymakers recognize that income inequality poses a significant barrier to achieving sustainable development. The vision of a world where every individual has equal rights, opportunities, and access to resources is a fundamental tenet of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). SDG 10 explicitly addresses the need to reduce inequality within and among countries. In this academic article, I, Alan B. Krueger, noted economist and advocate for tackling income disparities, explore the essence of SDG 10, its rationale, and its potential impacts.

SDG 10, titled "Reduced Inequalities," recognizes that income inequality hampers socioeconomic development and creates various interrelated problems within societies. The goal identifies inequality not only as an issue of income disparity but also as a matter of unequal access to basic services, opportunities, and resources. Within the framework of this SDG, policymakers aim to ensure that all individuals, regardless of their background, have equal access to education, healthcare, technology, and resources necessary for their well-being.

One of the central targets of SDG 10 is to progressively achieve and sustain the income growth of the bottom 40% of the population at a rate higher than the national average. This target acknowledges the importance of inclusive economic growth and sets a benchmark for policymakers to prioritize equitable distribution of resources. Achieving this target requires governments and institutions to implement policies that focus on improving the livelihoods of the most vulnerable populations, such as providing decent employment opportunities, social protection systems, and promoting financial inclusion.

Education is another cornerstone of SDG 10, as it plays a pivotal role in breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty and inequality. Target 4.5 of this goal emphasizes the need to eliminate gender disparities in education and ensure equal access to quality education for all. Narrowing the educational divide improves skill acquisition and enhances social mobility, particularly for disadvantaged groups. By investing in education, countries can empower individuals to escape the cycle of poverty and achieve their full potential, thereby contributing to overall economic growth and social well-being.

Combating inequality requires a comprehensive understanding of its multidimensional nature. Intersectionality, a concept deeply embedded in SDG 10, recognizes that various forms of discrimination, such as gender, race, ethnicity, age, disability, and migration status, intersect and compound the effects of inequality. Policymakers need to adopt heterogenous approaches that tackle multiple dimensions of inequality simultaneously. This integrated approach aims to address the numerous systemic barriers that perpetuate disadvantages among marginalized groups and thus promote inclusivity.

SDG 10 cannot be achieved without addressing the widening gaps between urban and rural areas and within regions. Target 10.A highlights the need to facilitate orderly, safe, and responsible migration and mobility of people, effectively implementing planned and well-managed migration policies. Ensuring equal access to basic services, infrastructure, and economic opportunities, especially in rural areas, is crucial to reducing spatial disparities. By focusing on ending regional disparities, policymakers can mitigate brain drain from rural areas while fostering sustained and inclusive economic growth.

To assess progress in reducing inequality, policymakers must rely on accurate and disaggregated data. Target 10.2 calls for the promotion of policies, such as universal access to banking and financial services, which can create a more inclusive and equitable society. Accessible and reliable data on income, wealth distribution, and social indicators helps identify and address the root causes of inequality, enabling evidence-based decision-making. Through robust data collection and analysis, policymakers can monitor progress, implement appropriate measures, and allocate resources efficiently.

The potential impact of SDG 10 extends beyond socioeconomic indicators. A more equal society fosters social cohesion, enhances political stability, and promotes inclusive institutions. By redistributing the benefits of economic growth and addressing systemic inequalities, societies become more resilient and have a stronger foundation for sustainable development as a whole. Additionally, reducing inequalities contributes to the realization of other SDGs, such as poverty eradication (SDG 1), good health and well-being (SDG 3), and gender equality (SDG 5).

In conclusion, SDG 10, "Reduced Inequalities," tackles the complex and interconnected issues of income disparity, uneven access to services, opportunities, and resources. Inequality, in its various dimensions, poses a barrier to sustainable development. The target of reducing inequality globally demands policymakers to address the structural impediments that perpetuate disadvantages among marginalized groups. By prioritizing inclusive economic growth, quality education, spatial equality, and reliable data, countries can create a more equitable and resilient society. Shifting the needle on SDG 10 not only paves the way for reduced inequalities but also paves a path towards sustainable and inclusive development for all.
