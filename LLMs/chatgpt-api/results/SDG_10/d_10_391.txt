It underscores the need for robust monitoring frameworks and data disaggregation to inform evidence-based policies and interventions.

3. Progress and Success Stories:
To show progress made thus far, the report highlights best practices, success stories, and initiatives that have effectively tackled inequality. It showcases examples of policies, programs, and interventions from different regions which can serve as an inspiration for the design and implementation of targeted strategies.

4. Recommended Strategies and Policy Interventions:
