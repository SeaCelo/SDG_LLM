Introduction

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is pleased to present this detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 10, which aims to reduce inequalities within and among countries. As a leading regional development bank in Asia and the Pacific, ADB recognizes the crucial role of addressing inequality in achieving sustainable and inclusive growth for the region.

Understanding Inequality

To thoroughly comprehend the complex issue of inequality, it is essential to examine both vertical and horizontal dimensions. Vertical inequalities refer to disparities between different socioeconomic groups, such as income inequality, gender inequality, and access to basic services. Horizontal inequalities, on the other hand, encompass inequalities in opportunities and outcomes across various geographical areas, ethnicities, and religions.

Current Landscape of Inequality

Asia, despite its remarkable economic progress, continues to grapple with persisting forms of inequality. Income disparities are omnipresent, with a significant portion of the population remaining in poverty while a small fraction reaps disproportionate benefits. Additionally, gender disparities persist in labor force participation rates, access to education and health services, and political representation. Meanwhile, vulnerable groups, including marginalized ethnic communities, indigenous peoples, and persons with disabilities, face multiple layers of discrimination.

Inequality in Asia and the Pacific is also deeply rooted spatially. Urban-rural gaps remain prominent, with inadequate infrastructure and basic services in rural areas limiting socio-economic opportunities and perpetuating poverty. Moreover, regional disparities exacerbate inequality within countries, as pockets of highly concentrated wealth and development contrast starkly with regions trapped in poverty and underdevelopment.

Challenges to Address Inequality

As the SDG 10 target implies, tackling inequality requires addressing multiple facets simultaneously. Political commitment, legal frameworks, and good governance play a crucial role in reducing inequalities by promoting inclusive policies and ensuring effective implementation at both national and regional levels. Furthermore, it is essential to enhance national capacities for data collection and analysis to accurately assess the magnitude, trends, and drivers of inequality.

Human capital development also assumes great significance in reducing disparities. Access to quality education and skills training equips individuals with the ability to compete in the rapidly evolving job market and escape the cycle of poverty. Additionally, prioritizing healthcare services, including universal access to affordable and quality healthcare, helps address the health inequities that often perpetuate poverty and widen socio-economic gaps.

Vulnerable groups require targeted interventions and social protection mechanisms. Initiatives aimed at eliminating discriminatory practices and policies, providing inclusive social welfare programs, and empowering marginalized communities facilitate their integration into the socio-economic fabric of society, bridging existing inequalities.

Regional Collaboration for Inclusive Growth

ADB recognizes that addressing inequality within and among countries requires regional cooperation and collaboration. Working closely with national governments, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders, ADB promotes inclusive economic growth by identifying and implementing policies and programs that prioritize those at the bottom of the pyramid. Leveraging its financial resources, technical expertise, and network, ADB facilitates knowledge sharing, best practices, and policy dialogues across countries to forge a comprehensive and sustainable approach towards reducing inequalities.

Conclusion

Addressing SDG 10 is a crucial step towards building a fair and equitable society. A comprehensive approach must encompass both the vertical and horizontal dimensions of inequality and tackle the root causes that perpetuate disparities. Through increased political commitment, investments in human capital, and targeted interventions for vulnerable groups, Asia and the Pacific can make meaningful progress in reducing inequalities. As a committed partner, the Asian Development Bank stands ready to collaborate and support regional efforts in achieving an inclusive and sustainable future for all.
