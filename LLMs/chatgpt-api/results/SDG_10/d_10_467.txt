Inequality exists in various forms, affecting countless individuals around the globe. It can manifest as disparities in income, education, access to healthcare, and basic necessities. These inequalities not only hinder social progress but also jeopardize the fabric of sustainable development. In response, the United Nations formulated the Sustainable Development Goal 10 (SDG 10) – Reducing Inequalities – with the pivotal aim of creating a more just and equitable world for everyone.

The SDGs, also known as the Global Goals, are a comprehensive set of 17 interconnected goals agreed upon by UN member states in 2015. Each goal addresses a specific aspect of sustainability and aims to promote inclusivity, economic growth, and environmental protection. SDG 10 targets inequality and serves as a compass guiding societies towards a fairer future.

Although various aspects of inequality are intertwined, SDG 10 primarily focuses on reducing income inequality. Income inequality refers to the unequal distribution of wealth and earnings amongst individuals or groups within a society. This disparity is measured using an indicator called the Gini coefficient, which calculates income distribution on a scale from 0 to 1, with 1 representing maximum inequality. By addressing this fundamental issue, SDG 10 aims to bridge gaps and eradicate systemic prejudices that perpetuate income disparities.

To champion the cause of reducing inequalities, SDG 10 outlines several crucial actions. First and foremost, it calls for the implementation of effective taxation policies that ensure the wealthiest members of society contribute their fair share towards public services and support for vulnerable groups. By redistributing resources through progressive taxation, nations can invest in social welfare programs, healthcare, and education to uplift marginalized populations.

Furthermore, SDG 10 emphasizes the importance of promoting economic and social inclusion. This involves not only providing access to essential services but also challenging discriminatory norms, practices, and policies that impede opportunities for disadvantaged groups. For instance, discriminatory hiring practices or wage gaps based on gender or ethnicity must be dismantled to build a society built on equitable treatment and fairness.

Education also plays a paramount role in reducing inequalities. SDG 10 recognizes the transformative power of education in reducing intergenerational poverty and unequal opportunities. By investing in quality education for all, promoting vocational training, and bridging the digital divide, nations can empower individuals to break free from the cycle of poverty, opening doors to decent jobs and brighter futures.

Implementing SDG 10 requires substantial coordination and collaboration between governmental entities, civil society, and private organizations. Everyone has a role to play, be it by advocating for reforms, supporting fair trade practices, or volunteering time and resources.
