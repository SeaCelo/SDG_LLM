The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by world leaders in 2015, consists of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aimed at eradicating poverty, protecting the planet, and ensuring prosperity for all. This report focuses on SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities, one of the key goals adopted by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA). 

The world has made significant progress in reducing poverty over the past few decades, but inequality has also continued to rise, becoming one of the most pressing issues of our time. SDG 10 aims to address this challenge by promoting inclusivity, equality, and social justice.

Middle income countries (MICs) play a crucial role in the global economy, making up a significant proportion of the world's population and facing specific challenges related to inequality. These countries often struggle with income disparities, gender inequality, exclusion of marginalized groups, and unequal access to basic services such as education, healthcare, and social protection. 

This report analyzes the current state of inequality in middle income countries, exploring key issues and highlighting good practices that contribute to reducing inequalities and ensuring progress towards SDG 10. By targeting an expert audience, it seeks to provide valuable insights and recommendations for policymakers, practitioners, and researchers working in these countries.

The report begins by offering a comprehensive analysis of inequality trends in middle income countries over the past decade. It examines the globally rising income concentration within these countries, leaving a substantial number of people behind.
