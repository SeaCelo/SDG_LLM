M. J. Akbar is an esteemed academic who has spent considerable time analyzing and delving into the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this article, we will discuss SDG 10 – reducing inequalities – and showcase how it serves as a critical framework for achieving greater social justice and inclusivity on a global scale.

SDG 10 is a natural progression from the preceding goals, reflecting the growing recognition of the need to address the disparities among individuals, communities, and countries. The goal aims to equip society with the necessary tools to overcome systemic inequalities, giving priority to marginalized groups and ensuring equal access to social, economic, and political opportunities throughout the world.

In examining the broad context and scope of SDG 10, it is relevant to remind ourselves that inter-country inequalities are still stark. The gap between developed and developing nations persists, often hindering social and economic progress in the latter. Additionally, inequalities within countries have reached alarming levels, thereby fostering resentment and undermining social cohesion. This makes it imperative to tackle both intra- and inter-country inequalities simultaneously.

One remarkable feature of SDG 10 is its holistic approach, recognizing that inequality extends beyond income disparities. This goal encompasses various dimensions such as social protection systems, access to basic services, land and property rights, inclusive and sustainable urbanization, and non-discriminatory laws and policies. By encompassing such an extensive array of factors, SDG 10 lays the groundwork for an all-encompassing approach towards reducing inequalities.

Furthermore, SDG 10 not only concentrates on minimizing inequalities in outcome but also emphasizes the need to address the unequal distribution of opportunities. It challenges society to dismantle barriers that hinder social mobility and limit individuals' abilities to reach their full potential, irrespective of their socioeconomic background. This approach highlights the importance of inclusive policies and actively working towards empowering marginalized communities through capacity building, access to quality education, and targeted interventions.

Addressing inequalities requires policy interventions at both local and global levels. From a local perspective, governments must take substantial steps to ensure equitable access to education, healthcare, and justice systems, particularly for marginalized groups. This requires targeted investments in infrastructure and social programmes that uplift the most vulnerable populations.

At the global level, it is crucial to recognize the interconnectedness of various countries and strive for fair and just international trade, financial systems, and governance. Solidarity and cooperation are essential to combatting inequalities globally. Developed countries must support their developing counterparts by providing financial assistance, technology transfer, and trade opportunities. By creating an enabling global environment, we can foster sustainable development and lift millions out of poverty.

There are also vital lessons to be learned from success stories in reducing inequalities. Countries such as Costa Rica, Uruguay, and Nepal have demonstrated significant progress in narrowing socioeconomic gaps through strategic policies, investments in public services, and promoting social inclusion. By analyzing these success stories, we can extract valuable insights and best practices that may be replicable in other contexts.

While SDG 10 sets an ambitious target to reduce inequalities by 2030, it is important to acknowledge the numerous challenges that lie ahead. In particular, vulnerable groups such as women, persons with disabilities, the LGBTQ+ community, and indigenous populations often face compounded forms of discrimination that require addressing specific barriers. Utilizing a gender and intersectional lens is crucial to ensure comprehensive and targeted measures.

To enhance the impact of SDG 10, robust monitoring and accountability mechanisms are crucial. By tracking progress and regularly reporting on the implementation of the goals, we can identify gaps, share best practices, and learn from our collective successes and failures. Inclusivity should be intrinsic in these processes, involving civil society, academia, private sector actors, and marginalized communities themselves.

In conclusion, SDG 10 is an imperative step towards achieving a more just and equitable world. By reducing inequalities, we can set the stage for sustainable development that is not only economically prosperous but also socially inclusive and environmentally responsible. The success of this goal depends on the determination and collaboration of all stakeholders, from policymakers to individuals in every corner of the globe. Let us unite our efforts to build a future where opportunities are truly equal for all.
