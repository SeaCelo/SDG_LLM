Introduction:

The International Red Cross (IRC) is pleased to present this comprehensive analytical report on the tenth Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) - "Reduce inequalities within and among countries." As an organization dedicated to alleviating suffering and promoting human dignity, the IRC firmly believes in the importance of addressing inequalities worldwide. This report aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the current state of SDG 10, including progress made, challenges faced, and recommended actions for both national and international stakeholders interested in achieving more equitable societies.

Understanding the Goals and Targets:

SDG 10 sets out a bold agenda to reduce inequalities across different dimensions, including income, social status, access to basic services, and opportunities. The targets for SDG 10 range from adopting and implementing social protection systems to promoting the social, economic, and political inclusion of all, regardless of age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion, or economic or other status. It also emphasizes the need to ensure equal opportunity and reduce disparities between rural and urban areas.

Assessing Progress and Challenges:

Despite positive developments achieved since the establishment of SDG 10, numerous challenges continue to persist, hindering progress towards reducing inequalities. Economic inequality remains a significant concern globally, with the wealthiest 1% accumulating an increasingly disproportionate share of wealth. Such inequality exacerbates poverty and social exclusion and undermines efforts to achieve sustainable development.

Income inequality perpetuates various forms of discrimination and exclusion, further hindering progress. Discrimination based on gender, ethnicity, age, disability, and immigration status pose substantial hurdles in attaining equal opportunities and access to resources. Moreover, progress towards reducing disparities in basic services, such as healthcare, education, and sanitation, remains uneven amongst different regions and societies. Marginalized and vulnerable groups often face reduced access to these essential services, limiting their ability to break free from the cycle of poverty and social exclusion.

COVID-19 Pandemic: A Magnifying Glass on Inequalities:

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on vulnerable and marginalized communities, further exacerbating existing inequalities. The IRC's analysis has revealed that the pandemic has both revealed and widened these gaps, with disadvantaged populations grappling with increased economic hardships, reduced access to healthcare, education disruptions, and heightened social fragmentation.

The pandemic has unmasked systemic inequalities in healthcare systems, as those with limited financial resources face challenges accessing testing, treatment, and vaccines. Furthermore, disruptions caused by school closures have disproportionately affected marginalized students, who often lack access to online learning platforms. Women, girls, and ethnically marginalized individuals have experienced an increase in gender-based violence, compounding existing discrimination and exacerbating their vulnerabilities.

Recommended Actions for Equitable Development:

To accelerate progress towards reducing inequalities, the IRC urges national and international stakeholders to focus on the following actions:

1. Prioritize inclusive economic growth by promoting sustainable and resilient livelihoods for all. This entails adopting fair labor practices, supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, and investing in job creation and entrepreneurship opportunities, particularly targeting disadvantaged communities.

2. Enhance social protection systems to provide a safety net for vulnerable individuals and groups. Expansion and improvement of social safety nets, including adequate universal healthcare coverage, income support, and social assistance, are crucial to protecting and supporting those in need.

3. Strengthen legal frameworks and institutions to combat discrimination and promote equal opportunities for all. This includes enacting and enforcing anti-discrimination laws, supporting affirmative action policies, and addressing discriminatory practices in employment, education, and public services.

4. Increase investments in quality and inclusive education, ensuring accessible, relevant, and affordable education for all. Improving educational infrastructure, reducing gender and socioeconomic disparities, and providing equal access to education for marginalized groups is essential for inclusive development.

5. Enhance international cooperation and partnerships to support low-income and developing countries' efforts in reducing inequalities. This can include financial assistance, technology transfer, and capacity-building initiatives, to promote sustainable economic growth and bridge the gaps in social and economic development.

Conclusion:

Reducing inequalities within and among countries remains a critical global objective. The International Red Cross acknowledges the progress made under SDG 10 but calls for intensified efforts to address persisting challenges effectively. By prioritizing inclusive economic growth, enhancing social protection systems, combating discrimination, strengthening education, and promoting international cooperation, countries can work towards a more equitable world, where every person enjoys equal rights and opportunities, leaving no one behind. The International Red Cross stands ready to collaborate with governments, international organizations, and civil society stakeholders to promote this crucial agenda.
