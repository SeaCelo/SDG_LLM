In recent decades, the global community has intensified its efforts to address pressing socio-economic and environmental challenges facing our planet. One such challenge is the provision of access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. This ambitious goal has been articulated in the form of Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7), as laid out by the United Nations. SDG 7 strives to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all humans by 2030. In this article, I, Joshua D Angrist, will examine the significance of achieving SDG 7, analyze its targets and indicators, discuss the progress made so far, and highlight some of the obstacles to its realization. Finally, to contextualize the significance of this SDG, I will explore the nexus between energy access and other sustainable development goals.

Access to energy is crucial for development as it underpins economic growth, poverty reduction, improved health, education, gender equality, and environmental sustainability. In many parts of the world, individuals rely on traditional, inefficient, and often hazardous forms of energy such as solid fuels like wood, charcoal, and animal dung, which contribute to air pollution and respiratory diseases. Transitioning to modern, sustainable sources of energy - like clean-burning cookstoves and renewable energy systems - not only improves health outcomes but also contributes to mitigating climate change.

SDG 7 is comprised of three main targets. Target 7.1 focuses on ensuring universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services. It means that every individual should have access to electricity and clean cooking facilities. Target 7.2 centers on increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix, while target 7.3 aims to improve energy efficiency in all sectors. These targets are accompanied by specific indicators to track progress and measure the extent of achievement.

Despite substantial progress over the past decade, the journey towards achieving SDG 7 is fraught with challenges. Lack of finance, inadequate policy frameworks, and technological barriers are significant bottlenecks. Many developing countries face fiscal constraints in mobilizing the necessary investment in energy infrastructure. Additionally, governance and regulatory frameworks need to be strengthened to attract private sector investment. Advances in technology, including renewable energy solutions, are critical but often inaccessible due to cost and implementation challenges.

However, numerous success stories provide hope and inspiration. Ethiopia has made tremendous strides in electrification by embracing off-grid solar and wind solutions, connecting millions of people to the energy grid in a decentralized manner. Bangladesh has implemented innovative models in rural areas, such as microgrids and solar home systems, that have expanded access to clean energy services. These examples demonstrate that policy coherence, partnership building, and technology transfers can drive progress towards achieving SDG 7.

The interconnections between SDG 7 and other goals in the sustainable development agenda deserve attention. Access to clean energy influences education (SDG 4) by enabling reliable lighting and power for schools, allowing children to study in the evenings. It impacts gender equality (SDG 5) by reducing the burden on women to collect firewood, enabling them to engage in income-generating activities. Combatting climate change (SDG 13) is intrinsically linked to SDG 7, as transitioning to renewable energy sources reduces greenhouse gas emissions and acts as a promising mitigation measure. Moreover, reliable access to energy supports a more inclusive and sustainable economy - contributing to decent work and economic growth (SDG 8) and sustainable infrastructure (SDG 9). It also facilitates access to modern healthcare (SDG 3) through the provision of electricity for medical facilities and refrigeration for vaccines.

In conclusion, SDG 7 is a crucial component of the broader sustainable development agenda. Access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy is fundamental to achieving poverty reduction, improved health, education, gender equality, and environmental sustainability. Although significant challenges exist, progress is being made through innovative approaches, partnership building, and technology transfers. Harnessing the interconnections between SDG 7 and other goals can amplify impact and pave the way for a more sustainable and prosperous future. To realize the vision of SDG 7 by 2030, governments, civil society, and the private sector must collaborate effectively, invest in transformative solutions, and prioritize inclusive policies to ensure that no one is left behind in the pursuit of universal energy access.
