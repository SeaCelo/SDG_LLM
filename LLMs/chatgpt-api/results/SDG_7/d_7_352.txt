Turkey's Commitment to Achieving Sustainable Development Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

Introduction:

The achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) is of paramount importance to Turkey, as it aligns with our commitment to sustainable development and improving the lives of our citizens. As an energy- and geographically-rich country, Turkey recognizes the transformative power of accessible, affordable, and clean energy for economic growth, social development, and environmental sustainability. This analytical report provides an in-depth analysis of Turkey's efforts towards SDG 7, focusing on the progress made, challenges faced, and the future course of action required for a successful transition to sustainable energy.

Overview of the Energy Landscape:

Turkey has achieved substantial progress in the energy sector, which makes up a significant portion of its economy. Our commitment to energy security, diversification, and sustainability has enabled us to become a key player in regional energy markets. However, achieving SDG 7 entails addressing multiple dimensions, including expanding access to electricity, promoting renewable energy sources, enhancing energy efficiency, and fostering energy research and development. Turkey has made remarkable advancements in all of these areas, making it one of the leading countries on the path to sustainable energy transition.

Expanding Access to Electricity:

Ensuring widespread access to electricity, specifically to rural and remote areas, is a pressing challenge for Turkey. To address this, we have implemented targeted programs such as the Renewable Energy Source Areas (YEKA) and the Electricity Distribution Transformation Programs. These initiatives aim to increase access to reliable and affordable electricity while reducing disparities in power supply across the country. Progress has been significant, with the electrification rate reaching 98% in urban areas and 90% in rural areas. However, challenges persist in reaching the most vulnerable populations where infrastructure development remains crucial.

Renewable Energy Sources:

Turkey recognizes the importance of transitioning from fossil fuel-based energy production to renewable energy sources. We have set an ambitious target of increasing the share of renewables, including wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass, in our energy mix to 30% by 2023. To promote renewable energy, we have introduced various incentives, including feed-in tariffs, a renewable energy resource area procurement mechanism, and the establishment of Renewable Energy Resource Zones. As a result, Turkey has witnessed a tremendous growth in renewables, leading the country to become one of the fastest-growing markets for renewable energy investment in the world. It is important to note that sustained investment in renewables is necessary to realize our goals and to foster a sustainable energy future.

Energy Efficiency:

Promoting energy efficiency across various sectors is an essential aspect of achieving SDG 7. Turkey has implemented numerous policies incentivizing energy efficiency in buildings, transportation, industry, and household sectors. The Energy Efficiency Law, along with the Energy Performance Certificate System, has played a fundamental role in driving energy-saving practices. Furthermore, the National Energy Efficiency Action Plans and the establishment of Energy Efficiency Coordination Council have been instrumental in integrating energy efficiency into our national policies and fostering cooperation among relevant stakeholders. Results so far have been encouraging, with energy intensity decreasing by 43% between 2000 and 2018, showcasing Turkey's commitment to enhancing energy efficiency.

Research and Development:

Investment in research and development (R&D) to drive innovation and enhance the deployment of sustainable energy technologies is essential for realizing SDG 7. Turkey has established various centers and institutes, bolstering the R&D capabilities in the energy sector. The Grid Simulation and Interconnection Research and Application Center and the Center for Energy and Sustainable Development are prominent examples. These institutions facilitate collaboration between academia, industry, and government agencies, leading to technological advancements and the adoption of sustainable energy practices. Continued investment in R&D, international cooperation, and knowledge exchange is crucial for Turkey to remain at the forefront of energy innovation.

Conclusion:

Turkey has made remarkable progress in its journey towards achieving SDG 7, affordable and clean energy. However, significant challenges remain, and continued efforts are vital to fulfill our commitments. Investing in rural electrification, expanding renewable energy capacities, promoting energy efficiency, and focusing on research and development are key areas where further action is needed. Turkey remains steadfast in its dedication to sustainable energy for the continued prosperity of its citizens and the global community. Through collaboration with international partners and alignment with best practices, we are confident in our ability to meet the targets set forth by SDG 7 and contribute to a future powered by renewable and affordable energy.
