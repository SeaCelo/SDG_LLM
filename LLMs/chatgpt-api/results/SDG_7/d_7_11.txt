Executive Summary

This analytical report conducted by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the current state of Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) and its targets in the Latin America and Caribbean region. SDG 7 focuses on guaranteeing access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all, and its ambitious targets set a sustainable path for the world's energy systems. 

Introduction

The current global energy landscape is confronted with numerous challenges such as climate change, energy poverty, and limited access to clean energy sources. SDG 7 addresses these concerns by explicitly calling for swift actions towards increasing renewable energy share, improving energy efficiency, enhancing access to affordable energy, and promoting sustainable development through energy access. 

Regional Analysis

Latin America and the Caribbean are characterized by a diverse and unique energy mix. The region has rich renewable energy resources, including solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal, which create enormous potential for clean energy generation. However, countries like Haiti and some Central American nations still face considerable challenges in ensuring reliable and affordable electricity access to their population. 

Access to electricity has improved significantly in the region over the past decade, but disparities across countries still persist. One of the main barriers is the remote and dispersed nature of some communities, making infrastructure deployment challenging and costly. To overcome these challenges, the ECLAC recommends targeted investments and innovative approaches, such as mini-grids, off-grid solutions, and distributed energy systems.

Renewable energy has witnessed remarkable growth in the region, with several countries generating a considerable proportion of their electricity from clean sources. Uruguay, for instance, has achieved 98% of its electricity generation from renewable sources, mainly from wind and biomass. However, countries like Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago heavily rely on fossil fuels due to their abundant reserves and established energy infrastructure. Diversification of energy sources and increasing the share of renewables requires financial incentives, policy frameworks, and technology transfer.

Energy efficiency remains a critical challenge across the region. Buildings, transportation, and industry sectors represent significant areas for improving energy efficiency. Rapid urbanization has led to increased energy demand from buildings, requiring the adoption of energy-efficient building codes and technologies. In the industrial sector, the implementation of energy management systems and cleaner production processes can contribute to improved energy efficiency. Similarly, greener transport infrastructure, including electric vehicles and improved public transportation, will play a vital role in achieving SDG 7 targets.

Recommendations for Policymakers

To accelerate progress towards SDG 7, policymakers in Latin America and the Caribbean should focus on the following key recommendations:

1. Strengthen regulatory frameworks: Ensuring stable, transparent, and consistent regulations that incentivize renewable energy deployment and energy efficiency improvements are crucial. This includes feed-in tariffs, auctions, and tax incentives to attract investments.

2. Promote regional cooperation: Enhancing regional collaboration and knowledge sharing will facilitate technology transfer and expertise exchange. Promoting collaboration through regional frameworks, such as renewable energy integration and interconnection, can unlock the potential of cross-border energy markets.

3. Increase investment in energy infrastructure: Significant investments in energy infrastructure are required to expand access to electricity, particularly in remote and underserved areas. Leveraging public-private partnerships, international cooperation mechanisms, and regional funds can mobilize the necessary resources.

4. Enhance capacity-building and training: In order to implement and scale up clean energy projects effectively, capacity-building efforts must be strengthened. Promoting technical and vocational training, knowledge sharing platforms, and strengthening research and innovation can enhance the region's human capital.

Conclusion

The analysis highlights the progress, challenges, and future prospects of achieving SDG 7 in Latin America and the Caribbean. While commendable strides have been made in renewable energy adoption and energy access improvement, significant efforts are still required. By implementing the recommended strategies, the region can step up its commitment to sustainable development through energy access and contribute to a cleaner, more inclusive future for all. ECLAC remains committed to supporting regional policymakers in their energy transition journey.
