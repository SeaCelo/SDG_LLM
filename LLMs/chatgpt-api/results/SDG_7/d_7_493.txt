The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have become a critical agenda for policymakers and scholars worldwide. Among these goals, SDG 7 places immense importance on ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. The Journal of Political Economy recognizes the significance of this goal and aims to explore its nuances in this article.

SDG 7 acknowledges the critical role of modern energy services in achieving sustainable development. Energy serves as a catalyst for social, economic, and environmental progress, playing a crucial role in eradicating poverty, improving healthcare, enhancing education, combating climate change, and promoting industrialization. To ensure an inclusive and sustainable energy transition, SDG 7 targets three main areas: universal access to electricity, enhanced energy efficiency, and increased use of renewable energy sources.

Ensuring universal access to electricity is central to alleviating poverty and fostering socio-economic development. Over 800 million people around the world lack access to electricity, predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. This energy poverty fuels disparities in income, education, and health outcomes. Extending access to reliable and affordable electricity can power economic activities, boost productivity, and improve access to essential services such as healthcare and education.

While providing access to electricity is paramount, achieving SDG 7 also demands increased energy efficiency. Energy efficiency reduces waste, mitigates environmental impacts, and enhances energy security. It involves improving the efficiency of energy usage in various sectors, from industry and transportation to buildings and appliances. Investments in energy-efficient technologies and practices can unlock significant economic and environmental benefits, leading to enhanced productivity, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and cost savings.

Renewable energy sources play a vital role in decarbonizing energy systems and combating climate change. SDG 7 urges a substantial increase in the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. Renewable energy, including solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power, provides clean and sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels. Transitioning to renewables not only curtails greenhouse gas emissions but also reduces reliance on finite resources, fosters energy independence, enhances energy security, and creates new employment opportunities in the renewable energy sector.

To meet the targets of SDG 7, governments, international organizations, private sector actors, and civil society must collaborate to address the multifaceted challenges. Policy innovation, investment, capacity building, and technology transfer are vital components of this collaboration. Governments need to establish enabling policy frameworks, financial incentives, and regulatory mechanisms to attract private investments in energy infrastructure and technologies. International cooperation and technology transfer can facilitate the dissemination of best practices and support developing countries in their energy transition efforts.

The journal recognizes the importance of innovative and interdisciplinary research to illuminate the various aspects of achieving SDG 7. Topics such as the political economy of renewable energy adoption, the effectiveness of energy policy instruments, the role of public-private partnerships, and the socio-economic impacts of energy access can shed light on practical strategies to accelerate progress towards SDG 7.

In conclusion, SDG 7 serves as a guiding framework for ensuring universal access to modern, affordable, and sustainable energy. The Journal of Political Economy recognizes the significance of this goal and encourages research that investigates the political, economic, and social dynamics underlying the achievement of SDG 7. By gaining deeper insights into the challenges and opportunities associated with sustainable energy transitions, policymakers and scholars can contribute to fostering an inclusive, resilient, and low-carbon future for all.
