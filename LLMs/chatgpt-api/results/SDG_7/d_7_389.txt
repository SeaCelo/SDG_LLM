Introduction:

The Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) aims to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all by 2030. This ambitious goal recognizes the central role of energy in achieving sustainable development while ensuring a transition to a low-carbon and resilient future. As the World Health Organization (WHO), we have examined the progress made towards SDG 7 and its implications for global health.

Overview of the current energy landscape:

Access to modern energy sources is crucial for essential health services and the overall well-being of communities. However, we still face significant challenges. As of 2021, around 759 million people worldwide lack access to electricity, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and small island developing states. Moreover, approximately three billion people continue to rely on traditional and inefficient cooking methods, such as solid fuels and open fires. This has detrimental effects on indoor air quality, leading to respiratory diseases, cardiovascular problems, and adverse birth outcomes.

Addressing health implications:

The lack of access to electricity hampers the provision of quality healthcare, especially in rural and remote areas. Health facilities without reliable power sources face numerous difficulties in vaccine storage, medical equipment functioning, and providing adequate lighting for surgeries and examinations. This hinders the delivery of essential health services and undermines emergency responses, leading to increased morbidity and mortality rates.

Furthermore, reliance on traditional cooking methods directly affects the health of individuals, particularly women and children. The inhalation of smoke from solid fuels causes respiratory infections, lung diseases, and increases the risk of acute lower respiratory infections in children. Additionally, the time spent by women and girls collecting fuel exposes them to various risks, including physical injury, harassment, and assault.

Renewable energy as a sustainable solution:

To achieve the targets of SDG 7, a transition towards renewable energy sources is imperative. Renewable energy not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions but also provides significant health benefits. Solar energy can power healthcare facilities and electrify remote areas where extension grids are challenging to establish. Additionally, utilizing wind and hydroelectric power can contribute to a clean and reliable energy supply, ensuring uninterrupted healthcare services.

Policy recommendations for realizing SDG 7:

1. Strengthening international cooperation: Integrated efforts from governments, international organizations, and stakeholders are necessary to secure financial and technical support for sustainable energy projects. Collaborative initiatives such as the UN's Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All) and the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves are crucial in accelerating progress towards SDG 7.

2. Creating enabling policy frameworks: Governments should promote renewable energy policies and frameworks that incentivize investment and remove barriers to clean energy adoption. This includes offering financial support, tax incentives, and creating a favorable regulatory environment for renewable energy ventures, enabling the involvement of the private sector.

3. Enhancing capacity-building initiatives: Building local capacities and knowledge-sharing in clean energy technologies, management, and systems is vital. Educational programs, vocational training, and on-the-ground support can empower communities to adopt sustainable energy practices and promote energy self-sufficiency.

4. Prioritizing health as an outcome: Integrating health considerations in the development of energy policies and projects is essential. Policy initiatives should prioritize the health and well-being of communities by assessing the impact of energy transitions and ensuring access to clean energy for healthcare facilities.

Conclusion:

Ensuring universal access to clean, affordable, and sustainable energy is a critical objective for sustainable development. The World Health Organization recognizes the interlinkages between energy, environmental sustainability, and health outcomes. By prioritizing the use of renewable energy sources, strengthening international cooperation, creating enabling frameworks, and including health considerations, the global community can achieve SDG 7, improve global health, and guarantee a sustainable and healthier future for all.
