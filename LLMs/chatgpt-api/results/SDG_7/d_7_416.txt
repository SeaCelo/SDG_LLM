Executive Summary:

This report provides a detailed analysis of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7, which pertains to ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. As a lead organization that advocates for the rights and well-being of older people, Helpage International aims to highlight the significant implications that SDG 7 has on this particular demographic. This report evaluates the current status of SDG 7 across countries and assesses its intersectionality with other goals, while providing recommendations to maximize the positive impact for older individuals.

1. Introduction

The global commitment to SDG 7 reflects an understanding of the essential role energy plays in sustainable development and poverty eradication. It recognizes that energy access is not only a fundamental human right, but it is also crucial for enhancing economic growth, improving health and education outcomes, promoting gender equality, mitigating climate change, and achieving overall well-being across all age groups.

2. Current Status of SDG 7 implementation

2.1 Universal Energy Access
Despite significant progress, it is imperative to acknowledge that many older persons still lack access to modern energy services. In rural areas, where the majority of older individuals reside, deficiencies in energy infrastructure persist, limiting these communities' development possibilities. Furthermore, cost remains a significant barrier for older persons, as limited financial resources often impede their ability to afford and maintain energy services in their households.

2.2 Renewable Energy Adoption
The transition towards renewable energy sources has gained momentum globally, aligning with SDG 7's target of substantially increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. However, older persons often face obstacles in accessing affordable and clean energy technologies due to financial constraints, limited technological literacy, and disparities in government policies and support.

3. Intersectionality with Other SDGs

3.1 Health and Well-being (SDG 3)
Energy access is intimately linked to health and well-being outcomes, particularly for older people who experience greater vulnerabilities. Reliable energy enables healthcare facilities to function optimally, with uninterrupted power supply for enhancing medical treatments and providing essential services. Moreover, access to clean cooking solutions reduces indoor air pollution, thereby reducing respiratory ailments, particularly among older individuals.

3.2 Gender Equality (SDG 5)
Older women bear a disproportionate burden in energy-related activities, including fuel collection, due to gender disparities rooted in social and cultural norms. Addressing energy poverty through affordable and sustainable solutions can alleviate their workload, promote gender equality in decision-making processes, and empower women as key stakeholders in sustainable development.

4. Challenges and Opportunities for Older Persons

4.1 Energy Poverty among Older Persons
Energy poverty, defined as the lack of access to modern energy services, disproportionately affects older persons, particularly in developing countries. The absence of reliable energy impacts their well-being, restricts economic opportunities, limits access to healthcare, and hampers the overall social inclusion of older persons.

4.2 Solutions for Aging Populations
Adopting age-sensitive energy policies and interventions is critical for addressing the evolving needs and challenges faced by older persons. Special consideration should be given to energy-efficient housing design, energy subsidies targeted at older individuals, awareness campaigns for behavioral change, and inclusive approaches incorporating the expertise and opinions of older persons into energy planning processes.

5. Recommendations

5.1 Enhancing Access and Affordability
Governments must prioritize universal energy access by integrating affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy solutions specifically designed to meet the needs of older populations. This can be achieved through comprehensive rural electrification programs, financial support mechanisms, subsidies, and assistance tailored to older persons, such as targeted social safety nets.

5.2 Integrating Renewable Energy Technologies
Stimulating the adoption of renewable energy technologies aligns with the global sustainability agenda, while also addressing energy poverty among older individuals. Governments should facilitate the integration of renewables into national grids, incentivize research and development on age-friendly energy technologies, and provide technical assistance for their uptake in both urban and rural settings.

5.3 Data Collection and Age-disaggregated Indicators
To ensure efficient measurement and monitoring of SDG 7 progress among older populations, comprehensive data collection systems that differentiate by age are essential. Governments and relevant stakeholders should prioritize the collection of age-disaggregated data to facilitate evidence-based policymaking and effectively address the energy needs and challenges faced by older individuals.

6. Conclusion

The successful implementation of SDG 7 is of paramount importance to address the energy needs of older individuals and achieve sustainable, inclusive, and equitable development. By acknowledging relevant challenges and opportunities specific to aging populations, policymakers can develop targeted strategies to enhance energy access, affordability, and sustainability for older adults, leaving no one behind in the pursuit of SDG 7. Helpage International remains committed to advocating for the rights and well-being of older persons and urges stakeholders to prioritize age-sensitive policies and initiatives to meet the energy needs of this demographic at a global level.
