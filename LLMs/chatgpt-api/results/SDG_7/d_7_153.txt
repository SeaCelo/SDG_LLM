The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have been widely hailed as a pathway to a better and more prosperous world. In particular, SDG 7 aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. While this goal may sound noble on the surface, a closer examination reveals the flaws and inconsistencies that make it unworthy of a serious commitment.

One of the main problems with SDG 7 is its emphasis on renewable energy sources. While it is certainly important to explore and develop alternatives to fossil fuels, the reality is that many developing countries lack the necessary infrastructure and resources to immediately transition to renewables. Forcing countries to abandon existing energy sources without providing viable alternatives is not only unrealistic but also detrimental to economic growth and societal advancements.

Furthermore, the focus on renewables fails to acknowledge the important role that fossil fuels play in modern society. They have brought unprecedented levels of comfort, mobility, and prosperity to communities around the world. The unrestricted pursuit of renewable energy can create a dangerous dependency on intermittent sources like wind and solar, leading to potential blackouts and higher energy prices, as we have seen in places like California.

Another glaring flaw in SDG 7 is its narrow approach to energy access. While the goal aims to provide energy for all, it fails to consider the diversity of energy needs across different regions, particularly in rural areas of developing countries. Many rural communities heavily rely on traditional biomass, such as wood and dung for cooking and heating. These methods, although not environmentally friendly, are vital for survival in areas where alternative sources of energy are scarce or unaffordable.

The blanket promotion of renewable energy overlooks the fact that some technologies, such as natural gas, can offer a cleaner and more cost-effective transition away from traditional biomass. Natural gas, which has significantly lower emissions than coal, can provide a bridge to a more sustainable future without the need for immediate and drastic changes. By disregarding the potential benefits of technologies like natural gas, SDG 7 is missing an opportunity to create an effective and realistic plan of action.

Furthermore, the SDG approach fails to consider the economic implications of its energy targets. Forcing countries to abandon their existing energy infrastructure would lead to job losses and economic decline. This could particularly impact developing nations that rely heavily on industries related to fossil fuels. The SDGs should instead focus on supporting these countries in their transition through technology transfers and capacity building rather than imposing unattainable targets.

In conclusion, SDG 7 may sound laudable, but its flaws and inconsistencies render it an impractical and potentially harmful goal. The focus on renewables disregards the necessary role that fossil fuels play in societal advancements and economic growth. The narrow approach to energy access overlooks the diversity of energy needs and fails to consider the potential of cleaner transition technologies such as natural gas. Furthermore, the disregard for economic implications undermines sustainable development as it forces countries to abandon established industries without providing viable solutions. It is essential that we approach sustainable development goals with a realistic and balanced perspective, rather than fall into the trap of blindly pursuing utopian ideals.
