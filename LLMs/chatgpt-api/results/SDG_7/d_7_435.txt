Executive Summary

This analytical report aims to provides a comprehensive overview of the progress made toward the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 7, as well as the existing challenges and suggested strategies for further advancement. Focusing on Oxfam's perspective, it presents an expert analysis of Goal 7, which aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all.

Introduction

Sustainable Development Goal 7 is a core aspiration for Oxfam and the international community as it addresses significant global challenges, including poverty, inequality, climate change, and the degradation of the planet. Energy access plays a central role in sustainable development and poverty eradication, as it enables communities to meet their basic needs, while also providing opportunities for education, health, and productive activities.

Progress Achieved

Significant progress has been made toward enhancing energy access worldwide. As of 2020, 90% of the world's population had access to electricity, with notable achievements in Asia and Latin America. Over the past decade, the electrification rate in sub-Saharan Africa increased by more than 10%, benefitting over 100 million people. Renewables have played a pivotal role in this progress, representing the largest source of new power capacity additions in recent years.

However, despite these advancements, approximately 789 million people still lack access to electricity, with almost 80% of them located in rural areas. Moreover, over 2.8 billion people continue to rely on traditional biomass for cooking, causing severe health and environmental consequences. These numbers underscore the urgency to accelerate efforts toward achieving universal energy access by 2030.

Key Challenges

1. Inadequate Investment: Insufficient public and private investment in energy infrastructure, particularly in rural and marginalized areas, hinders progress. Coordinated efforts must be made to mobilize funds and direct investments toward sustainable energy solutions that address the needs of the most marginalized communities.

2. Geographical Disparities: Regional disparities persist, with subsistence farmers and vulnerable communities in remote areas suffering the most from lack of energy access. This requires tailored interventions and investments specifically designed to overcome geographic barriers and prioritize marginalized communities.

3. Climate Change Impacts: Climate change exacerbates the energy access challenge, especially for those living in poverty. Extreme weather events and increased vulnerability to disasters disrupt energy infrastructure and make reliable access precarious. Sustainable energy solutions must be resilient and adaptive to climate change impacts.

Proposed Strategies

1. Integrated Approach: Addressing energy poverty requires an integrated approach that links access to energy, education, health, and livelihood opportunities. Governments, civil society organizations, and international institutions should collaborate and adopt a holistic approach to SDG 7 to ensure meaningful progress and sustainable outcomes.

2. Financing Strategies: The mobilization of adequate financial resources is pivotal for accelerating progress. Governments must prioritize energy access in national development plans and attract investments that support decentralized and renewable-based energy systems. Innovative financing mechanisms, such as blended finance and Impact Investment, should be explored to close the energy access investment gap.

3. Inclusive Decision-Making: Engaging communities, especially those that are traditionally underrepresented, is essential for building sustainable and inclusive energy systems. Meaningful participation of women, indigenous communities, youth, and other marginalized groups should be integrated into energy planning, policy-making, and decision-making processes.

4. Technology Transfer and Capacity Building: Investing in technology transfer, skills development, and capacity-building initiatives enable developing countries to build their own sustainable energy infrastructure. Developed countries must fulfill their commitments to support technology transfer and provide adequate technical and financial assistance to ensure the transfer of green technologies and knowledge.

Conclusion

The achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 7 requires a strong commitment from governments, civil society, and the international community. Addressing the existing challenges, such as inadequate investment, geographical disparities, and climate change impacts, demands a holistic and inclusive approach. By implementing the proposed strategies, we can make headway toward universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy, contributing to poverty eradication and the broader realization of the 2030 Agenda. Collectively, by doubling our efforts, we can build a more equitable and sustainable future for all.
