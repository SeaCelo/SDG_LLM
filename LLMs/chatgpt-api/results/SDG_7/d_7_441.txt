SDG 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all.

Report on the Current Status of SDG 7 - Expert Audience

Introduction:

Save the Children is pleased to present this detailed analytical report on the progress and challenges related to achieving SDG 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. The goal focuses on providing universal access to affordable and reliable energy, increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix, and doubling the rate of improvement in energy efficiency by 2030.

Current Status:

1. Access to Electricity: Despite significant progress, approximately 789 million people worldwide still lack access to electricity. In sub-Saharan Africa, where access rates are particularly low, less than half of the population has electricity. Scaling up electrification efforts in these regions remains crucial.

2. Renewable Energy: The global share of renewable energy in total final energy consumption reached 17.3% in 2017. However, progress has been uneven across regions. Substantial investment and policy support are needed to overcome barriers and enhance renewable energy deployment, particularly in developing countries.

3. Energy Efficiency: While energy intensity has improved globally, further efforts are required to double the rate of improvement by 2030. Enhancing energy efficiency in buildings, industry, and transportation is crucial to meeting global climate and sustainable development targets.

4. Clean Cooking Technologies: Approximately 3 billion people still rely on polluting and harmful cooking methods, leading to adverse health impacts, particularly affecting women and children. Adoption and scaling up of clean cooking technologies are essential to reduce indoor air pollution and improve health outcomes.

Challenges and Barriers:

1. Financing: Adequate financing for sustainable energy investments remains a significant challenge, particularly in developing countries. Limited access to capital, high upfront costs, and unfavorable regulatory frameworks hinder the transition to clean and sustainable energy sources.

2. Infrastructure: Expanding energy infrastructure, including grids and transmission networks, requires substantial investment. In remote and underserved areas, the lack of infrastructure poses a significant hurdle to achieving universal access to energy.

3. Policy Coherence: It is crucial to create an enabling policy framework that aligns with SDG 7 at all levels of governance. Integrated and coherent policies are necessary to promote renewable energy deployment, energy efficiency, and universal access to reliable and affordable energy.

4. Technology Transfer: Capacity-building and technology transfer play a critical role in enabling developing countries to transition to clean energy solutions effectively. Collaboration and knowledge-sharing among countries and institutions can facilitate the transfer of sustainable energy technologies.

Success Stories and Best Practices:

1. Bangladesh's Solar Home System Program: This program has successfully distributed over 6 million solar photovoltaic panels to households, dramatically expanding access to electricity in rural areas and reducing reliance on fossil fuels.

2. Morocco's Noor Ouarzazate Concentrated Solar Power Plant: With a total capacity of 580 MW, this pioneering project exemplifies Morocco's commitment to renewable energy. The plant has boosted the share of the country's electricity generation from renewable sources.

Conclusion:

While progress has been made under SDG 7, significant challenges remain on the path towards ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. To accelerate momentum, all stakeholders, including governments, civil society organizations, and the private sector, must collaborate in financing sustainable energy solutions, improving infrastructure, and implementing enabling policy frameworks. Achieving this goal will play a critical role in advancing sustainable development, mitigating climate change, and improving the lives of millions around the globe.
