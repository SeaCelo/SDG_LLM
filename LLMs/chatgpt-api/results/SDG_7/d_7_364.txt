The Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030. As part of our commitment to this goal, the European Investment Bank (EIB) has prepared a detailed analytical report to assess the current state of SDG 7 and its progress.

Introduction:
Energy is vital for social and economic development, and plays a crucial role in achieving most of the other Sustainable Development Goals. Despite significant progress in the past years, energy poverty persists, especially in low-income and underdeveloped regions. Thus, it is imperative to address the multifaceted challenges faced in order to ensure access to clean, affordable, and efficient energy for all.

Current Situation:
Energy Access:
While substantial advancements have been made over the years in terms of electrification, around 840 million people still lack access to electricity, with a large proportion located in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. This lack of electricity hampers education, health services, and economic productivity, perpetuating the cycle of poverty.

Renewable Energy:
The transition to renewable energy sources presents a significant opportunity for sustainable development. Europe has made notable progress in renewable energy deployment, with countries such as Sweden and Germany leading the way. However, the expansion of renewable energies has been uneven globally, with many developing countries still reliant on fossil fuels. Stricter regulations, incentives, and private sector investments are needed to accelerate the transition to renewable energy worldwide.

Energy Efficiency:
Improving energy efficiency is crucial, as it can simultaneously reduce greenhouse gas emissions, enhance energy security, and lower energy costs. Europe has taken strong strides in adopting energy-efficient technologies and developing stringent standards. However, much work remains to be done globally, as developing countries lack the necessary infrastructure and knowledge to implement energy-efficient measures.

Clean Cooking:
Access to clean cooking methods is a pressing global issue, directly impacting women, children, and the environment. Traditional biomass stoves and open fires contribute to indoor air pollution and deforestation. The deployment of clean and efficient cooking solutions, such as clean cookstoves and cleaner fuels, ensure better health outcomes and reduce carbon emissions.

Investment in Sustainable Energy:
Significant financial resources are required to achieve the targets outlined in SDG 7. While progress has been made in mobilizing public and private investments, additional efforts are needed to attract institutional investors, leverage private sector expertise, and unlock innovative financing mechanisms. The EIB stands ready to provide financial instruments, technical assistance, and advisory services to support sustainable energy projects globally.

Recommendations:
To accelerate progress towards SDG 7, the EIB recommends the following actions:

1. Strong Political Commitments:
Governments should prioritise the expansion of access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy by embedding SDG 7 into national policies, setting ambitious targets, and ensuring regulatory stability. Collaboration between public and private sectors to create an enabling environment for investment is paramount.

2. Renewable Energy Scaling-Up:
Developing countries should adopt favorable policies, incentivize private sector involvement, and secure financing for renewable energy projects. Sharing best practices and technological know-how between countries is crucial for enabling the global scaling-up of clean energy solutions.

3. Energy Efficiency Measures:
Developing countries should prioritize energy efficiency through measures such as building insulation, smart grids, and low-energy lighting. Sharing innovative technologies and fostering international partnerships can accelerate progress in this direction.

4. Increased Financing:
Scaling up investment in sustainable energy projects is pivotal. Multilateral development banks such as the EIB must play a key role in mobilizing resources and leveraging private investments. They should also invest in capacity building and technical assistance, particularly in regions that lack the necessary expertise.

Conclusion:
Achieving SDG 7 is crucial for enabling sustainable development and deserves significant attention and investment. The EIB is committed to supporting governments, institutions, and the private sector as they take on the challenges and contribute to the access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. Together, we can build a resilient and inclusive future.
