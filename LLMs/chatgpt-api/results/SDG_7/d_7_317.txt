Introduction

This detailed analytical report aims to analyze the progress and challenges surrounding Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) - Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. As a key player in global development initiatives, the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA) is committed to achieving the SDGs, and this report reflects a comprehensive analysis undertaken by our experts.

Overview of SDG 7

SDG 7 is centered around the provision of affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all people by the year 2030. This goal recognizes the fundamental role of sustainable energy in eradicating poverty, promoting economic growth, and ensuring environmental sustainability. It covers multiple aspects of energy, including electricity, clean cooking solutions, renewable energy, energy efficiency, and energy access in rural areas.

Progress and Achievements

1. Expansion of Access to Electricity: Globally, notable progress has been made in expanding access to electricity. Between 2010 and 2020, the number of people without electricity decreased from 1.2 billion to around 789 million, with Sub-Saharan Africa being the most significant contributor to this decrease. The Total Access to Sustainable Energy (TASE) initiative sponsored by DANIDA has been an integral part of achieving this progress.

2. Increasing Renewable Energy Investments: One of the cornerstones of SDG 7 is the transition towards utilizing more renewable energy sources. To this end, significant investments have been made globally in renewable energy, primarily driven by declining costs and policy support. For instance, solar costs have decreased by 90% between 2009 and 2020, leading to unprecedented uptake. Denmark's engagement in wind energy projects has furthered progress in this direction.

3. Advancements in Energy Efficiency Measures: Enhancing energy efficiency is crucial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and ensuring sustainable energy consumption patterns. Many countries have developed energy efficiency policies and are actively implementing them to reduce energy waste in buildings, transportation, and industrial operations. Denmark, as a leader in energy efficiency, has actively shared expertise and promoted best practices in this area.

4. Support for Access to Clean Cooking Solutions: Access to clean cooking solutions, particularly in developing regions, remains a substantial challenge. Two-thirds of the global population still relies on traditional biomass or inefficient cookstoves, leading to adverse health effects and environmental degradation. International efforts, including support from DANIDA, continue to promote the adoption of cleaner and more sustainable cooking technologies, such as biogas and improved biomass stoves.

Challenges and Key Areas of Focus

1. Access in Rural Areas: Despite significant progress in expanding access to electricity, addressing disparities in access between urban and rural areas remains a critical challenge. Rural areas often lag in terms of infrastructure development, making it difficult to extend electrification to these remote regions. Special attention needs to be given to off-grid and mini-grid solutions that utilize renewable energy sources to meet the unique needs of rural communities.

2. Financing and Investment: Accelerating progress toward SDG 7 requires substantial investments in energy infrastructure, especially in developing countries. Attracting and mobilizing financial resources is paramount to bridge the financing gap. This includes targeted investments and attracting private sector participation through innovative funding mechanisms, as successfully implemented in Denmark.

3. Integration of Renewable Energy into Grids: While renewable energy capacity has significantly grown, integrating large-scale intermittent renewable energy into existing grids poses technical and regulatory challenges. Strengthening grid infrastructure, fostering energy storage solutions, and establishing favorable grid codes are vital to the stable incorporation of renewables, while ensuring system resilience and reliability.

4. Energy Efficiency in Sustainable Development: While progress has been made in energy efficiency measures, it is essential to integrate energy efficiency as a cross-cutting priority in development planning. Improving policies, establishing energy efficiency standards, and raising awareness among all stakeholders can drive sustainable energy consumption patterns and support SDG 7 objectives effectively.

Conclusion

The analysis of SDG 7 presented in this report demonstrates both progress and challenges faced in the global pursuit of sustainable energy. Denmark, through DANIDA, has actively contributed to the achievements observed, utilizing its expertise and best practices to promote sustainable energy worldwide. To build on the progress made, concerted efforts are required to address the identified challenges, strengthen partnerships, and mobilize resources effectively. Only then can we fulfill the aspiration of universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all, playing a definitive role in sustainable development for generations to come.
