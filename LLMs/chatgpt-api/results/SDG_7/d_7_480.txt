The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set forth by the United Nations aim to transform our world by addressing a range of global challenges, and one critical goal that takes center stage is SDG 7—ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all.

In today’s world, energy serves as the fuel that powers our economies, drives innovation, and uplifts communities. However, there are still alarming disparities when it comes to energy access. Millions of people around the globe lack access to electricity, forcing them into a cycle of poverty and limited opportunities. Therefore, it becomes imperative for nations to address this issue and foster a sustainable energy future.

In line with SDG 7, the United States plays an essential role in a global collective effort to eradicate energy poverty. The country has made significant strides in diversifying its energy mix, moving away from fossil fuels and embracing cleaner and more sustainable alternatives. Initiatives such as tax breaks for renewable energy projects, increased investments in research and development for cleaner technologies, as well as efforts to improve energy efficiency have positioned the United States on a path towards achieving SDG 7.

However, progress does not come without challenges. The energy transition, while essential for the health of our planet, comes with its own set of hurdles. One major obstacle is the need for massive investments in renewable energy infrastructure. Expanding access to clean energy requires not only developing new generation capacity but also expanding transmission infrastructure to ensure efficient and reliable electricity distribution across the country.

Moreover, the transition to sustainable energy must be an inclusive one, leaving no one behind. Rural areas and marginalized communities often face additional barriers to accessing electricity, such as geographic isolation or financial constraints. Addressing these disparities calls for innovative solutions, partnerships, and policies that prioritize energy access for the vulnerable populations.

Thankfully, the United States is not alone in this battle. International collaboration and knowledge-sharing are keys to achieving SDG 7. Exchange of best practices, technologies, and policies between nations will pave the way towards a sustainable energy future. Furthermore, global efforts like the Paris Agreement create a platform for countries to come together, setting commitments and goals to fight climate change while promoting access to clean and affordable energy.

Remarkable progress has been made worldwide in recent years. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the number of people without access to electricity fell substantially, from 1.2 billion in 2010 to around 840 million in 2018. This is undoubtedly encouraging, as more individuals now have the ability to power their homes, schools, and businesses, enabling them to create a better future for themselves and their communities.

However, as the current COVID-19 pandemic has brought to light, there are still vulnerabilities to be addressed. With schools and businesses closed, proper access to electricity becomes crucial for online learning, remote working, and healthcare services. It has become even more evident that energy access is not just a development issue but also an essential component of resilience and socio-economic stability.

As we move forward, it is essential to acknowledge that achieving SDG 7 is not a destination but an ongoing journey. Building resilient energy infrastructure, improving energy efficiency, and increasing the share of renewables will require continued dedication and investments from governments, businesses, and civil society.

Ultimately, achieving SDG 7 is not just essential for those without energy access but also for the planet as a whole. Transitioning to sustainable energy sources can help mitigate climate change, reduce pollution, and preserve our natural resources for generations to come.

In the United States and around the world, the journey towards SDG 7 has begun, but there is still work to be done. By forging strategic partnerships, developing innovative solutions, and empowering all individuals with a reliable and sustainable energy supply, we can ignite a brighter future—one where energy poverty becomes a thing of the past, and sustainable development becomes a reality.
