At Catholic Relief Services, we are committed to supporting the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this report, we will carefully analyze and evaluate SDG 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. This goal is crucial for facilitating economic growth, reducing inequalities, improving health and education outcomes, and combating climate change.

SDG 7 is composed of 5 targets, which we will examine individually to assess the current progress, challenges, and opportunities associated with each one.

Target 7.1 aims to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services. While recent advancements have expanded energy access globally, over 800 million people still lack access to electricity, primarily in Sub-Saharan Africa and developing Asia. This lack of access hampers economic development, limits educational opportunities, and adversely impacts health care and basic amenities. To address this challenge, Catholic Relief Services has implemented several initiatives such as utilizing renewable energy technologies like solar power to provide electricity to remote communities.

Target 7.2 is focused on increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. Expanding the use of renewable energy sources is key to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, combating climate change, and ensuring energy security. Nonetheless, despite significant progress in this area, a substantial proportion of energy continues to be sourced from non-renewable fossil fuels. Our report emphasizes the importance of developing and implementing policies and incentives that accelerate the transition to renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and hydro power.

Target 7.3 centers on improving energy efficiency. Enhancing energy efficiency not only reduces environmental impact but also leads to significant cost savings and increased energy access. However, there is a need for greater investments in energy-efficient technologies, building designs, and industrial processes. Innovative solutions can be found through collaborative efforts among governments, private sectors, and civil society organizations. Catholic Relief Services actively promotes energy-efficient practices through various sustainable development initiatives, including capacity building and the distribution of energy-efficient appliances to marginalized communities.

Target 7.a aims to mobilize the financial resources required to improve energy infrastructure and expand energy services in developing countries. Insufficient financial investment is a major challenge in achieving SDG 7. Many developing countries lack the necessary resources to establish modern energy systems and infrastructure. In our report, we highlight the importance of international cooperation, public-private partnerships, and innovative financing mechanisms to bridge the funding gap and provide much-needed support to developing nations.

Finally, target 7.b encourages the expansion of global energy technology research and development, particularly to promote cleaner and sustainable energy technologies. Innovations in energy technology have the potential to revolutionize the energy sector, but require increased investment in research and development. Catholic Relief Services advocates for increased funding in this area to enable the development and adoption of cutting-edge technologies specifically designed for remote and marginalized communities.

To assess progress towards SDG 7, it is essential to develop comprehensive data monitoring systems, indicators, and reporting mechanisms. It is also important to ensure that energy interventions prioritize the needs and rights of vulnerable and marginalized populations, guaranteeing they are not left behind in the pursuit of sustainable energy solutions.

In conclusion, SDG 7 holds significant potential for driving sustainable development and combating climate change. Achieving this goal requires a multi-dimensional and multi-stakeholder approach, one that involves governments, international organizations, private sector entities, and civil society organizations like Catholic Relief Services. By working together, we can ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all, while simultaneously addressing the urgent need to transition to clean energy sources and combatting climate change.
