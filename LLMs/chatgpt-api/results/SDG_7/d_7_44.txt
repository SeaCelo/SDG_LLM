Violations of women's rights have long been recognized as a structural impediment to global development and the realization of human potential. Coupled with persisting poverty and inequality, these violations prevent sustainable and inclusive societal progress. Addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach encompassing an array of areas, including gender equality, energy provision, and environmental sustainability. The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) embodies such an approach by seeking to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all by 2030.

Gender equality is not simply about equal representation or opportunities for women; it concerns the recognition of women's rights and empowering them to participate fully and effectively in all aspects of life. Achieving gender equality encapsulates addressing social, cultural, and economic barriers that restrict women's access to resources, opportunities, and decision-making power. In relation to energy, gender equality entails reducing and ultimately eliminating the gender inequalities in access to, control over, and benefits from energy resources and services.

First and foremost, SDG 7 emphasizes the importance of universal access to affordable and reliable energy services. Around the world, about 789 million people lack access to electricity, with 80% of them living in rural areas. The majority of these individuals are women and girls who shoulder the burden of energy poverty in significant ways. Limited access to electricity and clean cooking fuels hampers their educational opportunities, health outcomes, and economic participation.

In this context, addressing energy poverty presents an opportunity to amplify women's voices and catalyze their empowerment. Women stand to benefit immensely from access to modern and sustainable energy services as it can facilitate income-generating activities, improve health through cleaner cooking solutions, and enhance educational opportunities of girls by enabling efficient studying after dark.

Moreover, ensuring gender equality in the energy sector itself is crucial for realizing the promises of SDG 7. The energy sector, historically dominated by men, must actively work towards dismantling the barriers that contribute to low female participation. Breaking down stereotypes, promoting vocational training and education for women in the energy sector, and increasing women's representation in decision-making positions are essential steps toward gender equality.

The promotion of gender-responsive energy policies also plays a pivotal role in achieving SDG 7 targets. Policymakers and stakeholders should prioritize integrating gender considerations into the entire energy value chain – from planning and design to delivery and monitoring. This means considering the specific needs, challenges, and opportunities of women and girls in energy infrastructure development, technology choices, and service provision. Such an approach has the potential to ensure that energy access benefits women as much as men and contributes to reducing inequalities across gender lines.

Efforts to universally provide clean and efficient energy also aligns with SDG 7's commitment to environmental sustainability. Access to modern energy solutions can reduce reliance on traditional biomass fuels, leading to improved indoor air quality and a decrease in deforestation. By promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency measures, resources can be conserved and harmful greenhouse gas emissions mitigated, thereby combating climate change.

As we strive to achieve SDG 7, it is crucial to recognize that the interplay between gender equality, energy access, and environmental sustainability is not merely coincidental, but tightly intertwined. Gender-responsive energy policies can open pathways to equal opportunities, improved health outcomes, and better economic prospects for women, while contributing to a more sustainable future.

Addressing SDG 7 effectively demands collaboration across different stakeholders, including governments, the private sector, civil society organizations, and the international community. Robust monitoring and evaluation mechanisms should be put in place to assess progress and hold accountable those responsible for implementing gender-responsive energy policies. Support for research and data collection will enable evidence-based decision-making and targeted interventions.

Progress must be accelerated, while ensuring that no one is left behind, particularly women living in poverty, ethnic minority groups, and others who face intersecting forms of discrimination. A comprehensive approach to SDG 7 is needed – one that acknowledges the complex interconnections between energy, gender, poverty, and the environment. Only through such concerted efforts can we truly transform the lives of millions by tackling energy poverty and facilitating gender equality, all while protecting the planet we inhabit.
