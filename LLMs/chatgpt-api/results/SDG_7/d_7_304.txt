In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the need to address energy access, renewable energy, and clean energy in the pursuit of sustainable development. In response to this urgent challenge, the United Nations has crafted the Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7): "Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all." As an economist and behavioral scientist, I find myself drawn to this goal due to its immense potential to transform the global energy landscape.

SDG 7 calls for action on multiple fronts: access, affordability, reliability, sustainability, and modernity. Considering access, it is estimated that over 789 million people still lack access to electricity, predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. This lack of energy access perpetuates poverty and hinders development prospects. By ensuring universal access to affordable and reliable energy, SDG 7 targets achieving inclusive growth and enabling economic activities in communities around the world.

Energy affordability is another critical aspect addressed by SDG 7 because the burden of excessive energy costs often falls disproportionately on vulnerable populations. Here, the concept of nudging becomes particularly relevant. Nudges, as I have extensively written about, are subtle changes in the way choices are presented that can lead to better decision-making and optimal outcomes. In the context of energy affordability, nudges can help promote energy-efficient behavior and incentivize investments in cleaner energy sources.

Moreover, reliability is a vital element in meeting the energy needs of societies. Unreliable energy supply not only disrupts daily life but also acts as a barrier to economic development. As a behavioral economist, I would argue that one potential solution to address this issue is to focus on overcoming short-term biases and encourage long-term planning for infrastructure development. By illustrating the long-term costs of unreliable energy supply, policymakers can effectively nudge decision-makers to invest in resilient power grids and decentralized energy systems.

Sustainability is undoubtedly at the core of SDG 7. Achieving sustainable development in energy requires a shift towards cleaner and renewable energy sources. Here, the role of behavioral economics plays a fundamental role in understanding and addressing the gap between intention and action. Individuals may express support for renewable energy but often default to conventional sources due to factors such as familiarity or lack of access. Behavioral interventions, such as reframing energy choices to make renewable options more salient and attractive, can significantly nudge consumers and policy-makers in the right direction.

Furthermore, SDG 7 emphasizes embracing modern energy technologies that can transform the energy sector. From grid integration and smart grids to decentralized energy systems and energy-efficient technologies, embracing modernity is essential in achieving the envisioned sustainable future. Behavioral insights can play an instrumental role in terms of promoting the adoption of modern technologies. By leveraging insights from choice architecture, policymakers and energy experts can design interventions that lead to the uptake of innovative technology and reshape energy consumption patterns.

In conclusion, SDG 7 reveals the intertwined nature of energy access, affordability, reliability, sustainability, and modernity in sustainable development. As a behavioral economist, my belief is that addressing these complex challenges necessitates insights from behavioral sciences. Incorporating behavioral economics into energy policy can enhance the effectiveness of interventions, aligning individual choices and preferences with long-term sustainable goals. As we strive to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy, combining economic principles, behavioral insights, and innovative policy solutions will be pivotal in bending the curve towards a clean and sustainable energy future.
