Introduction

This report aims to provide an expert analysis of Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) and its progress so far. SDG 7 seeks to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. As an international non-governmental organization focused on poverty alleviation and environmental sustainability, Tearfund is deeply committed to advancing Goal 7 and providing insights to experts in this field.

1. Current Situation

Access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy is crucial for economic development, poverty reduction, and sustainable living. Unfortunately, the global progress towards achieving universal access to electricity and clean cooking fuels remains insufficient. According to the latest data from the International Energy Agency (IEA), around 789 million people still lack access to electricity, while approximately 2.8 billion people rely on polluting solid fuels for cooking.

1.1 Electrification Rates

Significant progress has been made in increasing global electrification rates in recent years. However, there are still several countries and regions with extremely low electrification rates, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia. Despite ongoing efforts, many backward countries struggle to provide universal access to electricity due to factors such as inadequate infrastructure, limited investment, and policy challenges.

1.2 Clean Cooking Fuels

The use of traditional cooking fuels, such as wood, charcoal, and kerosene, not only contributes to indoor air pollution but also has serious health implications and adverse environmental impacts. Despite campaigns and initiatives promoting the adoption of cleaner cooking technologies, the transition to modern cooking fuels has been slow. It is estimated that nearly 40% of the global population still relies on traditional fuels for cooking, particularly in rural areas of low-income countries.

2. Challenges and Barriers

The achievement of SDG 7 faces several significant challenges and barriers:

2.1 Financing

Access to energy requires substantial investments in infrastructure development and capacity building. However, limited access to capital, especially in low-income countries, poses a significant challenge to achieving universal electricity and clean cooking access. Mobilization of sufficient financing and attracting private sector investment are crucial to bridge this gap.

2.2 Policy and Regulatory Frameworks

The effectiveness and efficiency of energy policies and regulatory frameworks play a vital role in achieving SDG 7. Implementing proper energy governance and encouraging supportive policies, regulations, and incentives are essential steps. However, many countries still lack strong legal and regulatory frameworks, hindering progress towards sustainability in the energy sector.

2.3 Gender Disparities

Women and girls, particularly in rural areas, are disproportionately impacted by limited access to clean and affordable energy. Gender inequalities often restrict their opportunities for education, health, and economic empowerment. Overcoming these disparities requires meaningful participation of women in decision-making processes along with targeted interventions that empower them to adopt and benefit from cleaner and more sustainable energy systems.

3. Success Stories and Best Practices

Although challenges persist, various success stories and best practices illuminate the potential for achieving SDG 7:

3.1 Renewable Energy Expansion

Several countries have successfully expanded their renewable energy capacity by adopting innovative policies, regulatory frameworks, and attract investments. For instance, Denmark has achieved remarkable progress in wind energy, with wind power surpassing its domestic electricity demand. Similarly, Costa Rica has made substantial strides towards becoming the world's first carbon-neutral country by promoting renewable energy deployment.

3.2 Clean Cooking Solutions

Localized initiatives and scalable approaches have proved effective in introducing clean cooking solutions. Promoting technologies like improved cookstoves and biogas digesters in rural communities has provided access to cleaner fuels while reducing indoor air pollution and deforestation. The Clean Cooking Alliance's efforts in collaborating with governments and businesses have yielded positive results in improving access to clean cooking fuels.

4. Recommendations

To accelerate progress towards SDG 7, Tearfund recommends the following actions:

4.1 Increase Investment in Energy Access

Greater investments are needed to expand energy infrastructure, especially in least developed and remote areas. Multilateral development banks, donor countries, and private sector entities should allocate a significant portion of funding towards energy access initiatives. Innovative financing mechanisms, such as outcome-based financing and blended finance, can help attract much-needed capital.

4.2 Strengthen Policy and Regulatory Frameworks

Countries should strengthen their energy policies and regulatory frameworks to provide an enabling environment for sustainable energy solutions. This includes streamlining permitting processes, establishing clear and transparent regulations, and integrating renewable energy targets into national energy strategies. Sharing best practices and knowledge transfer among countries can facilitate policy learning and implementation.

4.3 Promote Gender Equality and Social Inclusion

Efforts to enhance energy access should prioritize gender equality and social inclusion. This entails conducting gender-disaggregated data collection, integrating gender perspectives into energy planning and project implementation, and promoting women's entrepreneurship and leadership in the energy sector. Moreover, targeted interventions should empower marginalized communities and ensure their participation in decision-making processes.

Conclusion

The progress towards achieving SDG 7 is commendable, but significant gaps remain. Addressing the challenges of financing, policy and regulatory frameworks, and gender disparities is critical to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy. By implementing the recommended actions, stakeholders can drive the transformation needed for a sustainable future, while ensuring no one is left behind in the journey towards SDG 7's ambitious targets.
