Introduction

Access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy is vital for achieving sustainable development and improving people's lives. As the world continues to face massive energy challenges, countries need to work together to address these issues effectively. The 7th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG7) aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all by 2030. In this analytical report, we will provide a comprehensive analysis of the current state of SDG7, with a particular focus on China's efforts and cooperation in achieving this goal.

Overview and Challenges

Access to energy is crucial for eradicating poverty, promoting sustainable development, and achieving the other SDGs. Yet, approximately 789 million people still lack access to electricity, and around 2.8 billion people rely on traditional biomass for cooking and heating. This lack of access hampers economic growth, limits educational opportunities, and hinders healthcare services.

Coupled with inadequate infrastructures and outdated technologies, addressing the energy challenges requires substantial investments. Furthermore, climate change poses additional complications by increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, affecting energy supply and exacerbating energy poverty.

China's Approach and Contributions

As the largest developing country, China recognizes the importance of energy in sustainable development. The Chinese government has taken significant measures to tackle SDG7, both domestically and through international development cooperation.

Domestic Approaches

China is committed to improving energy efficiency, expanding renewable energy sources, and promoting clean and low-carbon development. The country has implemented several policies, regulations, and initiatives to increase energy access, reduce energy consumption, and transition towards renewable sources.

For instance, the "Energy Development Strategy Action Plan (2014-2020)" aims to establish a modern, smart, and sustainable energy system. China also leads globally in renewable energy capacity, having invested heavily in solar, wind, hydro, and biomass power generation. The "Beautiful China" initiative targets the reduction of air pollution and contributes to SDG7 by promoting cleaner energy solutions.

International Development Cooperation

China's international development cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) plays an essential role in addressing global energy challenges. By leveraging its experience and resources, China has been actively supporting other developing countries in achieving SDG7.

SOUTH-SOUTH Cooperation: China actively promotes South-South Cooperation by sharing its best practices, knowledge, and technologies. China assists partner countries in capacity building, infrastructure development, renewable energy, and efficient energy use.

Green Development Fund: As part of its overseas investments through the BRI, China has established the Green Development Fund. This fund supports renewable energy projects in participating countries and helps mitigate their energy deficits.

Renewable Energy Cooperation: China is an advocate for renewable energy and has collaborated with various countries in joint research, development, and deployment of clean energies. Initiatives like Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Global Energy Interconnection Development and Cooperation Organization (GEIDCO) promote investment in and development of renewable energy globally.

Case Study: China-Pakistan Economic Corridor

The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) represents an excellent showcase of China's efforts in achieving SDG7 through international cooperation. Under the BRI, China and Pakistan have collaborated in several energy projects aiming to alleviate Pakistan's energy crises.

Projects like the Sahiwal Coal Power Plant, Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park, and Port Qasim Coal-fired Power Plant augment Pakistan's energy supply and reduce the reliance on fossil fuels. This exemplifies how bilateral energy collaboration between China and Pakistan can contribute to achieving SDG7 and advancing both countries' development goals.

Conclusion

Ensuring universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy is a critical transformative step towards sustainable development. The achievement of SDG7 necessitates comprehensive approaches, both domestically and through international development cooperation.

China, as a leading advocate for sustainable development, has undertaken substantial efforts in reaching SDG7 objectives. By implementing ambitious domestic policies and actively participating in South-South Cooperation and the BRI, China has made substantial progress in the global pursuit of sustainable energy.

However, challenges and disparities persist, demanding continued multilateral efforts to address energy poverty. By building on the foundations already laid, reinforcing partnerships, and implementing innovative solutions, nations can collectively accelerate progress towards SDG7 and realize the vision of sustainable and affordable energy for all by 2030.
