Introduction

The aim of this detailed analytical report is to assess the progress made and challenges faced in achieving Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG 15) - Life on land. This report, prepared by the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA), specifically targets an expert audience and emphasizes the situation in least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs).

Summary of SDG 15

SDG 15 is centered on protecting, restoring, and promoting sustainable land use and biodiversity conservation. It acknowledges the crucial role of healthy and productive ecosystems in ensuring sustainable development, and emphasizes the importance of combating deforestation, desertification, biodiversity loss, and the illegal wildlife trade. The goal also addresses land degradation, degradation of natural habitats, and the need for sustainable forest management.

Current Status and Challenges

Progress on SDG 15 has been uneven across different regions and countries, with LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs facing unique challenges due to their limited resources, geographical constraints, and vulnerability to climate change.

Deforestation is a significant challenge across these countries, resulting from factors such as illegal logging, industrial agriculture expansion, and unsustainable forestry practices. This trend threatens not only terrestrial ecosystems but also exacerbates climate change by releasing stored carbon into the atmosphere.

Forest degradation, particularly in SIDS and LLDCs, is an additional concern. Many small island nations experience limited land availability, causing increased pressure on their natural resources. Furthermore, high population densities and dependence on agriculture contribute to land degradation, soil erosion, and loss of biodiversity.

Desertification is a major concern, especially for LLDCs. Climate change exacerbates desertification processes such as drying of water bodies, soil erosion, and land degradation. Reduced access to water resources undermines food security, economic development, and overall well-being.

While biodiversity conservation is essential for overall ecosystem resilience, LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs struggle with maintaining and protecting diverse species. These areas often harbor unique and endemic species, making the need for conservation efforts crucial. Insufficient financial and technical capacity, coupled with illegal wildlife trade, hampers conservation efforts and poses a threat to both biodiversity and sustainable livelihoods.

Most LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs rely heavily on agriculture and natural resource-based industries for their economies. Unsustainable agricultural practices, such as excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides, contribute to soil degradation and water pollution, affecting land productivity and resilience. Insufficient access to technology and knowledge exacerbates these challenges.

Promising Initiatives and Recommendations

Despite the challenges faced by LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs, several initiatives and recommendations can help advance progress towards SDG 15:

1. Strengthening national policies and regulatory frameworks: Enhanced legal and policy frameworks are necessary to address deforestation, land degradation, and biodiversity loss. This can be achieved through inclusive and participatory processes, recognizing the traditional knowledge of local communities.

2. Enhancing sustainable land and forest management: Providing technical assistance and financial support to LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs for sustainable land use practices and forest management can significantly contribute to achieving SDG 15. Promoting reforestation, afforestation, and sustainable forest management ensures the preservation of biological wealth and carbon sequestration.

3. Improving capacity-building and knowledge transfer: Building local capacities, particularly among resource-constrained stakeholders, would support the application of innovative and improved methodologies for sustainable land management, including climate-smart agriculture practices.

4. Strengthening international and regional cooperation: Multilateral and regional platforms could facilitate technology transfer, financial support, and knowledge sharing to assist LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs in addressing the challenges towards achieving SDG 15. Collaboration between stakeholders, governments, and civil society organizations will help promote global action and share best practices.

Conclusion

The challenges faced by LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs in achieving SDG 15 are complex and multifaceted, necessitating comprehensive and targeted interventions. Recognizing the distinctive context of these countries, national ownership, adequate financing, and technological support are crucial. Effective implementation of the recommendations proposed in this report, in line with country-specific contexts and priorities, can drive progress toward achieving SDG 15 and pave the way for sustainable and resilient ecosystems in the long term.
