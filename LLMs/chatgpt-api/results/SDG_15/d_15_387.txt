Executive Summary

This analytical report presents a comprehensive analysis of Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG 15) on Life on Land. As the World Bank Group, we aim to provide insightful information to the expert audience on the current progress and challenges associated with this goal. SDG 15 strives to protect, restore, and sustainably manage terrestrial ecosystems, halt biodiversity loss, combat desertification and climate change, and promote sustainable land use worldwide.

Introduction

SDG 15 recognizes the critical importance of conserving terrestrial ecosystems for the well-being of humanity and the planet. It recognizes the contribution of biodiversity towards the achievement of all the other SDGs and emphasizes the need for integrated efforts to address environmental issues, climate change, and poverty eradication.

Status of Current Progress

Assessment indicates that significant progress has been made worldwide, with various regions demonstrating commendable efforts towards achieving SDG 15. Conservation activities, initiatives for combating desertification, and addressing deforestation issues have been instrumental in advancing this goal.

Improvements in land use practices have been observed, embracing sustainable agriculture, agroforestry, and land restoration techniques to ensure the long-term sustainability and resilience of terrestrial ecosystems. Many countries have implemented legal frameworks and regulations to protect biodiversity and halt land degradation.

Critical Challenges

Although progress is being made, significant challenges remain in achieving SDG 15. Several threats to terrestrial ecosystems continue to persist.

Deforestation and forest fragmentation, driven by unsustainable logging, agricultural expansion, and infrastructure development, poses a severe problem. This contributes to loss of habitats, and subsequently, the extinction of plant and animal species. These activities also lead to soil degradation and reduced water availability.

Climate change exacerbates the challenges associated with SDG 15, affecting the frequency and intensity of natural disasters, increasing desertification, and altering ecosystems. Vulnerable communities bear the brunt of climate change impacts, experiencing disrupted livelihoods and food security.

Invasive species pose a significant threat to biodiversity and ecosystem functions by outcompeting native species, spreading diseases, and causing economic losses. Existing land tenure systems, including insecure land rights and conflicting land-use interests, further compound the challenges associated with sustainable land management.

Recommendations

Addressing the current challenges and accelerating progress towards achieving SDG 15 necessitate comprehensive and integrated approaches. The following recommendations are avenues to explore:

1. Strengthening Governance: Improving governance frameworks related to land use, introducing innovative policy mechanisms to reconcile competing land-use interests, and enhancing regulation and enforcement of sustainable practices will help protect ecosystems and halt biodiversity loss.

2. Investments in Sustainable Management: Scaling up investment in sustainable land management practices, such as afforestation and reforestation programs, restoration of degraded lands, and sustainable agricultural practices, can restore ecosystems and enhance resilience.

3. Enhanced Monitoring and Reporting: Strengthening monitoring and reporting mechanisms aids in tracking progress more effectively and guiding evidence-based decision-making. Implementing technologies like satellite imagery, remote sensing, and citizen science can facilitate data collection and mobilize meaningful action.

4. International Cooperation and Financial Support: Leveraging international cooperation, including South-South cooperation, and mobilizing sufficient financing are indispensable components. Continuous support, capacity-building, and technical assistance provided through Global Environment Facility (GEF) and similar initiatives will enable developing countries to implement sustainable practices effectively.

Conclusion

SDG 15 necessitates concerted efforts at local, regional, and global levels to preserve terrestrial ecosystems. Urgent action is required to combat deforestation, halt biodiversity loss, combat desertification, and tackle climate change to ensure the sustainable development of life on land. Working towards integrating this goal with other SDGs will significantly contribute to building a resilient future for our planet and for generations to come. The World Bank Group remains committed to partnering with countries and stakeholders to achieve these crucial targets and to promote a sustainable and inclusive world.
