Introduction:
The International Women's Development Agency (IWDA) is pleased to present this analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 15: Life on Land. In alignment with our mission to promote gender equality and women's empowerment across different development sectors, this report provides a comprehensive analysis of SDG 15, focusing specifically on its gender dimensions. The report aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the current status, challenges, and opportunities related to achieving SDG 15 targets, and highlights the crucial role of women in sustainable land management and biodiversity conservation.

Current Status:
SDG 15 seeks to protect, restore, and sustainably manage terrestrial ecosystems and halt biodiversity loss by 2030. It recognizes the significant threat of deforestation, land degradation, and species extinction, and provides a comprehensive framework for addressing these challenges. However, the current global progress towards SDG 15 is far from satisfactory.

Gender Inequities:
In understanding the current status of SDG 15, it is essential to acknowledge the gender inequities that persist within the sector of land management and biodiversity conservation. Women play a crucial role in these areas, yet they face numerous barriers that hinder their active participation and decision-making. Traditional norms, discriminatory legal frameworks, limited access to land tenure rights, and lack of inclusion in decision-making processes ceiling their impact potential, undermining the achievements of SDG 15.

Challenges and Opportunities:
The report meticulously identifies the challenges faced in achieving SDG 15 targets. These include the intensification of unsustainable land-use practices, illegal wildlife trade, resource extraction, and inadequate funding for biodiversity conservation initiatives. Additionally, the impacts of climate change further exacerbate these challenges, making urgent action even more critical.

While challenges exist, the report also emphasizes opportunities that can be harnessed to achieve SDG 15. Several indigenous and local communities, including women, have demonstrated successful approaches to sustainable land management and biodiversity conservation. Strengthening their knowledge, facilitating their active involvement, and ensuring equitable access to resources and decision-making processes can create an enabling environment for effective implementation.

Gender-Responsive Strategies:
To foster gender equality in SDG 15 implementation, the report highlights the importance of gender-responsive strategies. Meaningful participation of women in decision-making processes and leadership roles is critical for the development and successful implementation of policies, plans, and programs. Innovative approaches such as gender quotas, gender-responsive budgeting, and capacity-building initiatives can help mainstream gender perspectives in sustainable land management and biodiversity conservation efforts.

Inclusive Partnerships:
The report emphasizes the need for inclusive partnerships to address the various dimensions of gender inequality within SDG 15. Collaborations between governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), civil society, private sector actors, and local communities are crucial to ensure inclusive and holistic approaches. These partnerships should prioritize gender equality as a fundamental principle and actively work towards empowering women within the sector.

Recommendations:
Based on the analysis, the report lays out a set of recommendations to accelerate progress towards SDG 15. These include:

1. Addressing legal and policy barriers that prevent women from accessing and owning land.
2. Increasing investments in sustainable land management and biodiversity conservation, with a particular focus on gender-responsive budgeting.
3. Strengthening capacity-building programs for women, especially within indigenous and local communities.
4. Promoting gender-responsive data collection and analysis to inform evidence-based policies and programs.
5. Promoting inclusive and gender-sensitive partnerships at all levels to leverage collective efforts and resources for achieving SDG 15.

Conclusion:
This report critically assesses the current status of SDG 15, highlighting its gender dimensions. It underscores the need for concerted efforts to overcome gender inequalities and build inclusive partnerships to create a sustainable and equitable future for land and biodiversity. By integrating gender-responsive strategies, addressing policy gaps, and empowering women, we can pave the way towards achieving SDG 15, while simultaneously advancing gender equality and women's rights globally.
