Abstract:
This article analyzes the 15th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) established by the United Nations to protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, and halt biodiversity loss. As scholars in the field of Law and Economics, we examine the legal implications, economic considerations, and potential policy approaches to achieving this goal. We discuss the challenges associated with implementing SDG 15, including conflicts between economic development and environmental conservation, property rights issues, and the need for effective governance and international cooperation. By presenting rigorous research and analysis, this article aims to contribute to the current understanding of SDG 15 and foster discussions for evidence-based policymaking.

Introduction:
SDG 15, focusing on terrestrial ecosystems, is of vital importance as anthropogenic activities continue to exert pressure on the world's natural resources. This goal seeks to tackle issues related to deforestation, degradation of land, desertification, and biodiversity loss to ensure sustainable development. Drawing on insights from the field of Law and Economics, which emphasizes the interplay between legal institutions and economic systems, this article provides a holistic examination of SDG 15, highlighting the synergies between law, economics, and the environment.

Legal Implications and Framework:
A comprehensive legal framework is essential for implementing SDG 15 effectively. This framework should address property rights, natural resource management, environmental regulation, and sustainable land-use practices. Property rights play a crucial role as they determine ownership, usage, and responsibilities over land. Establishing secure and recognized property rights can incentivize sustainable land management, including the protection of ecological functions and prevention of land degradation. It can also facilitate the allocation of conservation areas and ensure wider access to resources for marginalized communities.

Environmental Regulation and Economic Incentives:
Robust environmental regulation is necessary to curb wasteful extraction of natural resources and encourage sustainable practices. Economic instruments such as taxes, tradable permits, and green subsidies can provide substantial incentives for land users to invest in sustainable practices. However, the design of these instruments should strike a balance between achieving environmental objectives and minimizing potential market distortions.

Costs, Benefits, and Decision-Making:
Achieving the targets of SDG 15 requires cost-effective decision-making. Economics can contribute valuable insights by conducting cost-benefit analyses to compare the economic costs of conserving ecosystems or rehabilitating degraded lands against the social and environmental benefits derived from such interventions. Given the scarcity of resources, decision-makers can prioritize interventions by selecting those with the highest social return on investment. Prioritization strategies should consider ecological variables, geographic regions, socioeconomic factors, and ecosystem services that communities depend on.

International Cooperation and Governance:
As land degradation, deforestation, and desertification transcend national boundaries, effective governance and international cooperation are indispensable for the success of SDG 15. Promoting cooperation among countries that share ecosystems, rivers, or transboundary landscapes can enhance the protection and sustainable use of shared resources. International agreements, like the Convention on Biological Diversity and regional agreements, are instrumental in fostering collaboration on issues like land use planning, biodiversity conservation, and restoration of degraded areas.

Synergies and Trade-offs with Other SDGs:
Sustainable development requires examining the interconnectedness of all SDGs. While focusing on SDG 15, there are synergies and trade-offs with other SDGs, such as SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), and SDG 13 (Climate Action), among others. For instance, sustainable land management practices can contribute to food security, water availability, climate mitigation, and urban planning. By recognizing and strategically addressing these synergies, policymakers can effectively advance multiple goals simultaneously.

Conclusion:
SDG 15's ambitious targets necessitate the collaboration between law and economics to find sustainable solutions for terrestrial ecosystem conservation. A robust legal framework, including property rights, environmental regulation, and incentive mechanisms, is crucial for success. Applying economic analysis enables policymakers to make evidence-based decisions and prioritize interventions effectively. International cooperation and governance mechanisms that transcend borders are indispensable for tackling cross-boundary challenges. By considering the interconnectedness with other SDGs, maximum progress towards sustainable development can be achieved. This article provides a comprehensive analysis that contributes to the understanding of SDG 15 and offers insights for evidence-based policymaking in the pursuit of a greener and more sustainable future.
