Introduction:

The Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG 15) focuses on protecting, restoring, and promoting the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, halting deforestation, managing forests sustainably, and combating desertification. This report, prepared by Slovak Aid, provides a detailed analysis of the current status and progress of SDG 15.

Current Status:

SDG 15 aims to ensure the conservation, restoration, and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems globally. The world's forests, which are at the heart of this goal, currently cover about 30% of the global land area, with significant variations by region. However, deforestation and degradation threaten their sustainability, as approximately 3.3 million hectares of forests are lost annually, primarily due to agricultural expansion, logging, and infrastructure development.

Key Challenges:

1. Deforestation: Deforestation continues to pose a significant threat to global biodiversity and ecosystems. It affects air and water quality, exacerbates climate change, and disrupts essential ecosystem services. Immediate measures must be taken to address this issue, including promoting sustainable land management practices and providing incentives for reforestation and afforestation efforts.

2. Forest Degradation: Increasing pressures, including illegal logging, unregulated mining, and invasive species, contribute to the degradation of forests. This issue requires integrated management approaches, increased law enforcement, and collaborative efforts between governments, communities, and key stakeholders to halt the loss of forest cover and protect biodiversity.

3. Desertification: Desertification, primarily caused by a combination of climatic changes and human activities, detrimentally affects lands, ecosystems, and livelihoods. Enhancing resilience measures, promoting sustainable land management, and supporting communities susceptible to desertification are key priorities to address this challenge effectively.

4. Loss of Biodiversity: The loss of biodiversity limits the capacity of ecosystems to provide critical services, such as food provision, water purification, and climate regulation. Conservation efforts must be strengthened worldwide through protected areas, habitat restoration, and sustainable utilization of natural resources to safeguard biodiversity and maintain ecological balance.

Progress and Achievements:

Despite the challenges, significant progress has been made towards achieving SDG 15 targets. Many countries have implemented conservation and forest management initiatives, leading to sustainable practices and landscapes. The commitment to reducing deforestation and promoting reforestation has increased, facilitating the regeneration of degraded ecosystems. Furthermore, global efforts like the Bonn Challenge have spearheaded international collaboration on forest landscape restoration, contributing to the conservation of critical ecosystems and biodiversity.

Best Practices and Lessons Learned:

Numerous best practices have emerged in the pursuit of SDG 15. For example, Costa Rica has successfully shifted towards more sustainable forest practices by offering financial incentives to landowners who conserve forests. Additionally, Ecuador's innovative BioTrade program has integrated conservation goals with novel market incentives for products derived from sustainably managed areas, benefiting local communities and safeguarding biodiversity.

Conclusion:

While progress has been made in addressing the challenges associated with SDG 15, more comprehensive and collective action is required to achieve its targets. Increased financial support, strengthened international collaboration, and capacity-building measures are necessary to encourage sustainable land management practices and combat deforestation, desertification, and biodiversity loss. By actively engaging key stakeholders, including governments, civil society, and local communities, a future aligned with the principles of SDG 15's vision of healthy and resilient ecosystems can be realized.
