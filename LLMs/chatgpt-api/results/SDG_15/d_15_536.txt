Abstract:
This paper explores the relationship between business venturing and Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15, which aims to preserve and restore terrestrial ecosystems and promote sustainable land use. By analyzing the current status of SDG 15 and showcasing business ventures that align with its principles, this article highlights the role of entrepreneurial initiatives in addressing environmental degradation and promoting sustainable solutions. The findings reveal the potential of business venturing to contribute to SDG 15, offering opportunities for future research and practical implications for entrepreneurs, policymakers, and stakeholders.

Introduction:
SDG 15, "Life on Land," focuses on protecting and restoring terrestrial ecosystems, combating deforestation, promoting sustainable land use, and halting biodiversity loss. Achieving these targets demands holistic efforts from a variety of stakeholders. While governments, NGOs, and civil society organizations have been primarily responsible for championing environmental conservation, an increasing interest lies in understanding the role that businesses and entrepreneurial ventures can play in advancing SDG 15.

Review of SDG 15:
This section provides an overview of SDG 15 and its targets in relation to the sustainable management of forests, combating desertification, halting biodiversity loss, promoting sustainable land use, and engaging stakeholders in achieving these goals. We examine the current status of SDG 15, outlining its global achievements, challenges, and gaps that need to be addressed comprehensively. This review sets the stage for assessing the potential synergy between business ventures and SDG 15.

Business Venturing and SDG 15:
As entrepreneurs constantly seek new opportunities, the water-energy-food nexus and other sustainable development challenges create a fertile ground for business ventures promoting ecological balance. By adopting innovative technologies, sustainable practices, and alternative business models, entrepreneurial ventures can contribute significantly to SDG 15. This section explores various ways in which entrepreneurship can tackle the challenges and leverage opportunities presented by SDG 15. Case studies and examples of successful business ventures supporting environmental conservation are analyzed and presented, illustrating the diverse approaches and impact of entrepreneurial efforts.

Opportunities and Challenges for Entrepreneurial Ventures:
This section delves into the opportunities for entrepreneurial ventures within the context of SDG 15, such as sustainable agriculture practices, reforestation initiatives, ecotourism endeavours, and green supply chain management. We also discuss the challenges faced by entrepreneurs, including regulatory barriers, limited access to capital, the need for cross-industry collaborations, and engaging stakeholders in creating shared value. Successful entrepreneur-led models for addressing these challenges are highlighted to provide insights for both aspiring and active entrepreneurs.

Collaborations and Partnerships:
Collaboration between businesses, governments, and civil society organizations is crucial for creating an enabling environment for sustainable land use. We examine the significance of cross-sector partnerships in driving sustainable business ventures related to SDG 15. Identification of opportunities for collaboration, best practices, and initiatives that foster knowledge sharing and cross-fertilization of ideas are discussed.

Implications for Policymakers and Business Venturers:
This section provides an outline of policy recommendations for governments and related institutions to support and enable entrepreneurial ventures aligned with SDG 15. Policymakers are encouraged to create supportive regulatory frameworks, establish funding mechanisms, and design incentives for businesses to adopt sustainable practices. For entrepreneurs, we discuss the importance of integrating environmental considerations into business models, adopting sustainable supply chains, and engaging in sustainable entrepreneurship practices.

Conclusion:
This paper demonstrates the immense potential of business ventures to contribute to SDG 15 and promote sustainable land use. It highlights the importance of entrepreneurial initiatives, fostering resilience and innovation with regard to terrestrial ecosystems, forestry, biodiversity, and land management. The paper concludes by emphasizing the significance of fostering collaborations between businesses, governments, and other stakeholders locally and globally to collectively achieve the objectives outlined in SDG 15.
