Executive Summary:

This detailed analytical report aims to provide an overview of the current status, challenges, and potential solutions relevant to achieving Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG 15) â€“ Life on Land. The analysis has been undertaken by Women in Europe for a Common Future (WECF), a non-governmental organization dedicated to promoting gender equality, sustainable development, and the protection of the environment.

Introduction:

SDG 15 focuses on the conservation, restoration, and sustainable management of terrestrial ecosystems. This goal is particularly crucial as the degradation of ecosystems and biodiversity loss pose significant challenges to achieving sustainable development globally. The current report delves into the elements that hinder progress toward SDG 15 and identifies key actions required to address these obstacles effectively.

Status and Challenges:

1. Ecosystems Loss and Biodiversity Decline: The loss of forests, wetlands, and other vital ecosystems remains a prevailing concern worldwide. The report highlights the alarming decline in biodiversity and emphasizes the need for urgent action to halt and reverse habitat destruction.

2. Land Degradation: Unsustainable land-use practices, such as deforestation, overgrazing, and soil erosion, continue to degrade land resources. The report underscores the importance of sustainable land management practices to prevent further degradation and enhance soil health and fertility.

3. Illegal Wildlife Trade: Illicit trade in wildlife and their products not only threatens biodiversity but also undermines national and international efforts for biodiversity conservation. The report emphasizes the necessity of stringent regulation, law enforcement, and collaborations to combat wildlife trafficking effectively.

4. Indigenous and Local Communities Exclusion: The report underscores the need to involve indigenous and local communities in decision-making processes related to land management and conservation, as they possess invaluable traditional knowledge and sustainable practices.

5. Climate Change Impacts: The exacerbating impacts of climate change further aggravate land degradation, biodiversity loss, and ecosystem vulnerability. The report addresses the importance of integrated strategies that simultaneously address climate change and achieve SDG 15 targets.

Key Actions and Recommendations:

1. Strengthened Conservation Measures: Enhanced support for protected areas, biodiversity hotspots, and ecologically sensitive regions is vital. This includes bolstering the establishment of new protected areas and improving their management through engaging local communities and building capacity.

2. Sustainable Land Management: Encouraging the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices, such as agroecology and agroforestry, can contribute to the restoration of degraded lands, enhance soil health, and improve food security.

3. Combatting Illegal Wildlife Trade: The report recommends strengthening international cooperation, sharing best practices, and increasing financial and technical support to tackle the root causes of wildlife trafficking, including demand reduction efforts and the coordination of effective law enforcement.

4. Promoting Indigenous and Local Community Participation: Advocating for the inclusion of indigenous and local communities' rights and knowledge in policy design and implementation is vital. Empowering these communities through secure land tenure rights can enable sustainable land management and biodiversity conservation practices.

5. Synergistic Approaches: Addressing the impacts of climate change requires the integration of climate mitigation and adaptation in land-use planning and ecosystem restoration efforts. This calls for cross-sectoral cooperation, enabling synergies between SDG 13 (Climate Action) and SDG 15.

Conclusion:

Though challenges persist, achieving SDG 15 is feasible through adopting a cross-cutting approach that values biodiversity conservation and sustainable land management. The identified actions and recommendations provide a pathway toward realizing this goal, highlighting the indispensable contribution of women and Indigenous knowledge in attaining sustainable development at multiple levels. By addressing SDG 15, it is possible to bridge the gap between conservation and development while ensuring a prosperous future for all.
