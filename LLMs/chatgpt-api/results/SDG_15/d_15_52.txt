Sarah Holland-Batt is one of Australia's prominent poets, known for her outstanding works on various topics including nature, the environment, and humanity's interaction with the natural world. In this academic article, we will explore SDG 15: Life on Land, as if written by Sarah Holland-Batt, delving into the intricacies and significance of this Sustainable Development Goal.

SDG 15 aims to protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, and halt biodiversity loss. At its core, this Goal recognizes the crucial importance of land and its role in sustaining life on Earth. It reflects the urgent need to restore the balance between human activities and the natural environment, preserving the richness and diversity of terrestrial ecosystems for generations to come.

Poetry has long been used as a means of exploring and connecting with the natural world. This creative expression's ability to captivate emotions and provoke reflection aligns seamlessly with the values of SDG 15. Holland-Batt's poetry is deeply rooted in her contemplation of the interconnectedness of human life and the environment, making her a fitting voice to discuss this critical issue.

The overarching concern addressed by SDG 15 is undoubtedly the impact of human activity on the planet. Holland-Batt's work often explores the destructive consequences of human actions on the natural world. In her poem "Smoke," she evokes a vivid image of a burning forest and the devastation it leaves behind: "the will to consume/ slows, smoke unravelling inside her / limbs". The poem serves as a powerful call to awaken our collective responsibility and take action to protect our forests and ecosystems from further destruction.

Additionally, the Goal highlights the importance of restoring degraded lands and balancing human activities with the preservation of biodiversity. Holland-Batt's poem "The Corroded Sun" magnificently captures the lamentation for a world suffering from interspecies loss: "there, right nearby on the limb of the Chestnut Teeb, the flagship species / are gone, sodden flowers / in one multi flamed bouquet". Through these lines, she highlights the irreversible consequences of biodiversity loss caused by human exploitation, urging us to recognize the interconnectedness and value of all living beings.

As we strive to achieve SDG 15, collaborations among nations, communities, and individuals are pivotal. The poem "Earthly Stars," written by Holland-Batt, beautifully encompasses the essence of collective responsibility through a spiritual journey where nature is illuminated by an omnipresent force. She writes, "an overwhelming question / beckons from drop to leaflet calling wake from world...above them lay opulent stars, exotic invader/change them too markedly, ruined these ordinary collations / restored humanity collapses tiers of rippled grief".

In these lines, Holland-Batt emphasizes the importance of transcending individual interests and working together to address the current environmental crisis. The poem's interplay of emotional grounding and cosmic mysticism serves as a reminder that fostering a harmonious relationship with the natural world is not only our duty but also fundamental to our existence.

Moreover, SDG 15 recognizes the vital role of sustainable land management practices, to prevent land degradation and desertification. Holland-Batt's poem "Thermal Inversions" articulates the interconnectedness between land use and climate change: "...and the cut / fully disrupted by fire", directly acknowledging the alarming consequences of unsustainable land practices and the urgent need for change.

Literary expressions are an effective means of pinpointing our collective shortcomings and illuminating the transformative paths. By drawing our attention to these issues through her powerful poetry, Sarah Holland-Batt aptly exemplifies the significance of SDG 15 and its potential impact on our lives.

In conclusion, SDG 15 presents a comprehensive framework and philosophy to restore balance and ensure the preservation of life on land. Sarah Holland-Batt's poetry interacts superbly with this Sustainable Development Goal, providing an evocative and thought-provoking exploration of humanity's complex relationship with the natural world. By embracing and embodying the essence of SDG 15, we can work toward halting the erosion of our lands, maintaining healthy ecosystems, and protecting the diversity and interconnectedness of all forms of life.
