Introduction

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG 15) - Life on Land, with a focus on its current state, challenges, and possible areas for improvement. As a leading global organization working to protect and save children, Save the Children is committed to tracking progress and advocating for the achievement of SDGs. This report targets an expert audience and aims to guide policymakers, researchers, and other stakeholders in understanding the intricacies of SDG 15.

Current State of SDG 15

SDG 15 aims to protect, restore, and sustainably manage terrestrial ecosystems, combat desertification, halt land degradation, and ensure the conservation of biodiversity. It recognizes the significance of well-functioning ecosystems for environmental and human well-being. Moreover, SDG 15 acknowledges the role forests play in mitigating climate change and promoting sustainable development.

One key indicator of progress in SDG 15 is the proportion of land that is covered by forests. As of now, over 31% of the global land area remains covered by forests. However, this figure obscures regional disparities and ongoing deforestation. It is crucial to recognize that progress in tackling deforestation has been uneven, with several countries experiencing alarming rates of forest loss.

Challenges and Barriers

Deforestation and forest degradation continue to pose significant challenges to SDG 15. Human activities such as agriculture expansion, illegal logging, infrastructure development, and urbanization contribute to the destruction of forests and other terrestrial ecosystems. These activities not only result in the loss of crucial biodiversity but also undermine the livelihoods of millions of people who depend on forests for subsistence, income, and cultural identity.

Furthermore, addressing desertification and land degradation is essential for achieving SDG 15. Nearly one-third of the Earth's land surface is affected by desertification, leading to deteriorating soil productivity, reduced water availability, and the displacement of communities. Climate change exacerbates these issues, increasing the vulnerability of people, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions.

Areas for Improvement

To effectively address the challenges faced by SDG 15, several areas require further attention and action. Save the Children proposes the following recommendations for improvement:

1. Strengthen Sustainable Land Management Practices: Encouraging sustainable land management practices, such as agroforestry, rotational grazing, and watershed management, plays a critical role in halting land degradation and desertification. Governments should invest in promoting and implementing these practices, ensuring they are accessible to local communities.

2. Enhance Forest Conservation and Restoration: Intensified efforts are needed to protect and restore forests, with a focus on biodiversity conservation. This includes promoting community-based forest management approaches, awareness campaigns, and stringent enforcement of laws against illegal logging and deforestation.

3. Promote Indigenous and Local Community Engagement: Recognizing the vital role Indigenous peoples and local communities play in preserving biodiversity and managing ecosystems, their rights and knowledge should be acknowledged, respected, and integrated into decision-making processes. Engaging these communities empowers them as stewards of their land while enabling sustainable development.

4. Strengthen International Cooperation and Partnerships: Collaboration among countries, organizations, and stakeholders is crucial to achieving SDG 15. Supporting initiatives like REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) and enhancing financial resources for conservation efforts in developing countries is vital for success.

Conclusion

Achieving SDG 15 is not simply about preserving forests and halting land degradation; it is about protecting the interconnectedness of life between humans, animals, and ecosystems. The complexities involved demand collaborative efforts at all levels and the allocation of adequate resources. Save the Children remains dedicated to its mission of working towards the realization of SDG 15, ensuring a sustainable future for our planet and the well-being of all its inhabitants.
