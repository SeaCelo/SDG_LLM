Abstract:
This article provides a comprehensive analysis of Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG 15) - "Life on Land" as outlined by the United Nations. The goal aims to conserve and restore terrestrial ecosystems and promote sustainable forestry and land use practices. We examine the key objectives, targets, and indicators of SDG 15, evaluate its progress since its inception, and discuss its broader implications for the global economy. Furthermore, this article engages in a comparative analysis to assess the interlinkages between SDG 15 and other goals under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We highlight the importance of a holistic approach to sustainable land management and the role of economic policies in achieving a more balanced and inclusive model of development.

Introduction:
SDG 15 aims to safeguard our terrestrial ecosystems, enhance sustainable land use practices, combat desertification, and halt biodiversity loss. It recognizes that sustainable development is contingent upon the preservation and responsible management of our natural resources. The goals and targets within SDG 15 not only address environmental concerns but also promote economic growth, poverty reduction, and social well-being.

Objectives and Targets of SDG 15:
The prime objective of SDG 15 is to sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, and halt biodiversity loss. This objective is supported by a set of targets, including the restoration of degraded land, the conservation and restoration of ecosystems, the reduction of the degradation of natural habitats, and the prevention of the extinction of threatened species. Each target is accompanied by specific indicators that help monitor progress and aid policy formulation.

Progress and Challenges:
Since the adoption of SDG 15 in 2015, considerable efforts have been undertaken worldwide to advance its objectives. Launching major initiatives, such as the Bonn Challenge and the New York Declaration on Forests, has realigned global focus towards sustainable land use and reforestation. Additionally, partnerships between governments, private sectors, and civil society organizations have been forged to combat desertification and preserve endangered species' habitats. However, despite these initiatives, the rate of deforestation and land degradation continues to pose a significant challenge to achieving SDG 15. Addressing these challenges requires comprehensive policies and mechanisms that safeguard our ecosystems and promote sustainable land use practices.

Interlinkages with Other SDGs:
SDG 15 is closely interconnected with several other Sustainable Development Goals. Action to conserve and restore ecosystems and combat desertification contributes to achieving SDG 14 - Life Below Water and SDG 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production. Forest-based industries and sustainable forestry practices align with SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure. Furthermore, SDG 15 has implications for poverty reduction (SDG 1), climate action (SDG 13), and gender equality (SDG 5) as well.

Economic Implications:
SDG 15 reflects the growing recognition among economists and policymakers that environmental concerns are intrinsic to economic development. The loss of ecosystems, biodiversity, and natural resources carries significant economic costs, including erosion of rural livelihoods, decreased agricultural productivity, and the decline of tourism and ecotourism revenues. Adopting sustainable land management practices not only helps mitigate environmental risks but also generates economic opportunities. By valuing and investing in natural capital, policymakers can build resilient economies and secure the well-being of future generations.

Conclusion:
SDG 15 underscores the fundamental importance of preserving terrestrial ecosystems and managing land sustainably. This article has examined the key objectives, targets, and progress of SDG 15, emphasizing its interlinkages with other goals within the 2030 Agenda. Nonetheless, achieving SDG 15 requires concerted efforts from governments, corporations, civil society, and individuals to mitigate land degradation, reverse biodiversity loss, and promote sustainable forestry. By recognizing the economic benefits of investing in nature, we can propel the global economy on a more sustainable and inclusive path towards achieving the SDGs collectively.
