Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a set of ambitious global targets designed to address the world's most pressing issues. Among these goals, SDG 15 stands as a critical framework for combating one of humanity's most pressing challenges: protecting and restoring terrestrial ecosystems. In this article, we delve into the significance of SDG 15 and explore its underlying principles and ramifications for global development, all from the perspective of Esther Duflo, a renowned economist specializing in poverty alleviation.

SDG 15, titled "Life on Land," serves as a clarion call to action in response to the ongoing environmental crises that pose existential threats to Earth's terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity. Recognizing that land degradation, deforestation, desertification, and the loss of biodiversity continue to exacerbate poverty and inequality, this goal highlights the critical need to reverse these destructive trends and restore the health of our planet's flora and fauna.

An essential element of SDG 15 is its recognition of the interconnectedness between poverty and environmental degradation. As climate change intensifies and ecosystems face increasing pressure, vulnerable populations suffer the most from its adverse effects. This mandate demands an informed and integrated approach that addresses economic development hand in hand with sustainable land management practices. Esther Duflo, a pioneer in experimental economics and development economics, underscores the necessity of evidence-based policy interventions to achieve these outcomes effectively.

To fully grasp the significance of SDG 15, we must consider the immense ecosystems services and resources it seeks to protect and restore. Forests, wetlands, and other terrestrial ecosystems play a vital role in maintaining critical natural processes such as carbon sequestration, water filtration, erosion control, and biodiversity conservation. They are integral to global climate regulation and serve as natural buffers against natural disasters, reinforcing the social and economic resilience of communities.

Moreover, the well-being of marginalized communities is profoundly linked to the state of land systems. The impoverished often rely heavily on natural resources for their livelihoods, including timber, water, and agricultural produce. Unsustainable practices, often driven by poverty and lack of alternatives, further perpetuate the cycle of environmental degradation and socio-economic exclusion. In this context, SDG 15 offers a coordinated approach to address these challenges, enabling policy interventions that promote sustainable land management practices while fostering inclusive development.

Duflo's expertise in empirical research and rigorous evaluation provides a crucial framework for addressing the intricacies involved in achieving SDG 15. Her groundbreaking studies on poverty alleviation have consistently highlighted the importance of context-specific interventions based on in-depth analysis and robust evidence. Applying this perspective to SDG 15 implies recognizing the diversity of landscapes, communities, and socio-cultural contexts around the globe, calling for tailored solutions rather than universal prescriptions.

One key aspect Duflo emphasizes is the importance of economic incentives in driving sustainable land management. By conducting experiments and implementing randomized evaluations, she has identified effective strategies for eliciting behavioral change among actors. In the context of SDG 15, this approach can be harnessed to
