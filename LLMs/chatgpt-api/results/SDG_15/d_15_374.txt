Introduction:
The Islamic Development Bank (IDB) presents this detailed analytical report on SDG 15 - Life on Land, as part of our ongoing commitment to sustainable development. SDG 15 focuses on the conservation of terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity, promoting sustainable land management practices, and combating desertification, deforestation, and wildlife trafficking. This report critically examines the current state of SDG 15, assesses progress made by member countries, identifies challenges and opportunities, and provides concrete recommendations for achieving the targets set under this goal.

Overview of SDG 15:
SDG 15 aims to protect, restore, and promote the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, including forests, wetlands, mountains, and drylands, by the year 2030. These ecosystems are home to a significant proportion of Earth's biodiversity and provide numerous ecosystem services that are vital for human well-being and economic development. The targets under SDG 15 encompass various aspects related to biodiversity conservation, sustainable land management, combating desertification, and protecting endangered species.

Progress and Challenges:
Since the adoption of SDG 15, member countries of the Islamic Development Bank have taken several steps toward achieving the targets. Governments have implemented policies and initiatives to conserve ecosystems, restore degraded lands, protect endangered species, and support sustainable agriculture. For instance, in Sudan, efforts have been made to curb deforestation by promoting sustainable forestry practices and establishing protected areas. Likewise, in Indonesia, measures have been undertaken to combat illegal logging and conserve the critically endangered orangutan population.

However, significant challenges remain. Deforestation and land degradation continue to be pressing issues in several member countries. Unsustainable agricultural practices, illegal logging, and urban expansion threat the integrity of terrestrial ecosystems. Moreover, weak governance, resource constraints, and limited access to advanced technologies pose significant hurdles to achieving the targets. Land degradation caused by climate change, such as desertification, is exacerbating the challenges faced by countries in the IDB focus regions, the MENA and Sub-Saharan Africa, where vulnerable populations depend heavily on natural resources for their livelihoods.

Best Practices and Success Stories:
Several member countries within the IDB have successfully implemented measures to address the challenges of SDG 15. For example, in Saudi Arabia, the "Green Saudi Initiative" was launched to protect and restore marine and terrestrial ecosystems, including planting 10 billion trees by 2030. The initiative also promotes sustainable agricultural practices and aims to conserve natural resources and biodiversity.

In Mali, the "Great Green Wall" project seeks to address desertification, particularly in the Sahel region, by restoring degraded lands, implementing sustainable land management strategies, and promoting alternative income-generating activities. This integrated approach has not only contributed to land restoration but also improved food security, increased income generation, and strengthened community resilience.

Recommendations for Future Action:
To accelerate progress towards SDG 15, the Islamic Development Bank recommends the following key actions:

1. Enhanced Policy Frameworks: Member countries should develop and strengthen policies that prioritize biodiversity conservation, sustainable land management, and combating desertification. Integration of SDG 15 targets into national development plans, collaboration between sectors, and effective regulatory enforcement can significantly contribute to achievement.

2. Capacity Building and Technology Transfer: Strengthening the capacity of relevant stakeholders and facilitating the transfer of advanced technologies play a vital role in addressing the challenges of SDG 15. Member countries should invest in research and development, promote knowledge-sharing platforms, and facilitate technology transfer to ensure effective management of terrestrial ecosystems.

3. Financial Support: Mobilizing adequate financial resources is crucial for implementing SDG 15 targets. Member countries should explore innovative financing mechanisms such as public-private partnerships, green bonds, and blended finance models to attract investment in sustainable land management projects. The IDB can also provide technical and financial support to member countries to implement nature-based solutions for ecosystem conservation.

4. Multi-stakeholder Engagement: Collaboration among governments, civil society, private sector actors, and indigenous communities is essential for achieving SDG 15. Member countries should encourage inclusive governance mechanisms, involve local communities in decision-making processes, and promote public awareness campaigns to mobilize support and create a shared sense of responsibility towards sustainable land management.

Conclusion:
SDG 15 faces significant challenges and opportunities in member countries of the Islamic Development Bank. While progress has been made, there is a pressing need for sustained efforts, policy reforms, and increased financial investments. By implementing the recommended actions mentioned in this report, member countries can enhance their aims towards protecting terrestrial ecosystems, biodiversity conservation, sustainable land management practices, and combatting desertification, ultimately contributing to the achievement of SDG 15 and the broader sustainable development agenda.
