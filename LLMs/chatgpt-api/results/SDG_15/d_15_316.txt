INTRODUCTION

Welcome, distinguished experts, to this analytical report commissioned by the Czech Development Agency on Sustainable Development Goal 15: Life on Land. In this report, we shall delve into the current state of SDG 15, its progress, challenges, and potential pathways to achieve its targets. SDG 15 aims to protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, halt land degradation, and halt biodiversity loss by 2030. It encompasses a broad range of issues critical to the health and resilience of our planet's terrestrial ecosystems.

PROGRESS AND CHALLENGES

SDG 15 has been endeavoring to address a multitude of interconnected challenges over the years. One prominent issue is the significant global decline in forest areas due to activities such as deforestation and unsustainable logging. Despite considerable efforts, the current deforestation rate stands at an alarming 10 million hectares per year. Curbing this trend is imperative since forests play a crucial role in climate regulation, biodiversity conservation, and providing livelihoods for local communities.

Additionally, combating desertification and land degradation remains a pressing challenge in many regions, particularly in arid and semi-arid areas. Over 23% of global land areas are experiencing degradation, resulting in reduced soil fertility, water scarcity, and diminished agricultural productivity. This situation perpetuates a vicious cycle of poverty, exacerbates food insecurity, and hampers overall development efforts.

Furthermore, the loss of biodiversity is occurring at an unprecedented rate, with around one million species under threat of extinction. Protecting and conserving a healthy array of terrestrial ecosystems is essential not only for the intrinsic value of biodiversity but also for ensuring the provision of ecosystem services vital to human well-being, such as clean air and water, pollination, and natural pest control.

THE ROAD TO ACHIEVEMENT

Despite the challenges, progress has been made in various areas under SDG 15. Strong international commitments and conservation initiatives, such as protected area networks, have contributed to the expansion of protected lands. As of 2020, approximately 15% of land areas are under some form of protection. However, it is crucial to ensure their sustainable management, adequate financing, and effective enforcement to reap their full benefits.

Sustainable land management practices have gained momentum with the adoption of integrated landscape approaches. These approaches promote a holistic understanding of ecosystem dynamics, involving various stakeholders in decision-making processes, and employing sustainable practices like agroforestry and watershed management. Scaling up such practices in collaboration with local communities is crucial for restoring and rehabilitating degraded lands.

Promoting responsible and sustainable business practices across various sectors is indispensable to achieving SDG 15. Encouraging private sector investments that prioritize biodiversity and ecosystem conservation, as well as sustainable supply chain management, could pave the way for transformative change within industries.

Moreover, effective natural resource management strategies, including improved land governance, rights-based approaches, and equitable access to resources, should be integrated into national policies and legal frameworks. These efforts will enhance the long-term sustainability of terrestrial ecosystems while providing decision-makers with the necessary tools for effective implementation.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, significant work lies ahead for the achievement of SDG 15: Life on Land. Addressing the challenges of deforestation, desertification, and conserving biodiversity requires multi-dimensional and holistic approaches. Collaboration between governments, civil society, academia, and the private sector is pivotal to the successful implementation of solutions for sustainable land management and biodiversity conservation. The Czech Development Agency stands committed to supporting these efforts by emphasizing the importance of SDG 15 through funding, technical assistance, and knowledge exchange. Together, let us embark on a transformative journey towards securing a sustainable future for life on land and bequeathing this planet to future generations in a healthier and more resilient state.
