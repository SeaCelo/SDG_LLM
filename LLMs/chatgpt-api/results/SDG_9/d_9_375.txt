The following report provides a detailed analysis of the current status of Sustainable Development Goal 9, which aims to build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation. This report has been compiled by the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) and is targeted towards an expert audience.

Infrastructure plays a crucial role in economic growth, business development, and sustainable living. However, many countries still face challenges in developing efficient and robust infrastructure systems. SDG 9 seeks to address these challenges by promoting sustainable infrastructure that supports economic development and innovation while leaving no one behind.

1. Overview of SDG 9:
SDG 9 envisions the promotion of inclusive and sustainable industrialization, innovation, and resilient infrastructure. It acknowledges that inclusive and sustainable industrialization is essential for job creation, poverty eradication, and overall economic growth. Resilient infrastructure is critical for ensuring access to basic services, such as transportation, water, and energy. Innovation is seen as a crucial driver of sustainable development.

2. Progress Review:
The progress towards achieving SDG 9 has been commendable in several areas, but challenges persist. In terms of infrastructure development, significant improvements have been made in increasing access to basic services, such as electricity, clean water, and road networks, particularly in developing countries. Many countries have also made substantial efforts to increase their industrial capacity, focusing on high value-added and sustainable industries.

However, there remain considerable disparities between developed and developing countries in terms of infrastructure quality and coverage. Many low-income countries, especially those in Africa and parts of Asia, still suffer from inadequate transport systems, limited access to electricity, and a lack of high-quality telecommunications networks. Additionally, the disparity in industrial development creates discrepancies in employment opportunities and income levels between regions and social groups.

3. Key Challenges:
(a) Financing: One of the key challenges in achieving SDG 9 is access to financing for infrastructure projects. Investments in infrastructure require substantial funds, often beyond the capacity of many developing countries. Therefore, increasing access to financing, both domestic and international, is crucial for achieving this goal.

(b) Technology and Innovation: The rapid pace of technology and innovation presents both opportunities and challenges. While technological advancements have the potential to revolutionize infrastructure and industry, developments are not always evenly distributed. Ensuring that developing countries have access to affordable, clean, and sustainable technologies is crucial for achieving SDG 9.

(c) Capacity Building: Building the necessary capacity and expertise at the national level is vital to effectively plan, manage, and sustain infrastructure projects. This includes skills in project finance, appropriate governance structures, and knowledge transfer. Enhancing regional and international cooperation in capacity building is essential to bridge the knowledge gap.

4. Key Recommendations:
(a) Strengthening Financing Mechanisms: Efforts should focus on enhancing instruments and mechanisms that support infrastructure financing, such as blended finance, public-private partnerships (PPPs), and risk mitigation instruments like guarantees. Multilateral investment institutions like MIGA can play a significant role by providing guarantees to private investors in infrastructure projects.

(b) Technology Transfer and Innovation: Promote technology transfer and knowledge sharing, particularly in developing countries, to bridge the technological gap. Encourage collaborations between public and private entities, facilitate the creation of favorable regulatory frameworks, and ensure the protection of intellectual property rights.

(c) Capacity Building Initiatives: Strengthen national and regional capacity building institutions to enhance project management skills and knowledge transfer in infrastructure and industrial sectors. Facilitate partnerships between advanced and developing countries to foster knowledge exchange and transfer.

(d) Data Collection and Monitoring: Establish robust data collection and monitoring systems to track progress towards SDG 9 targets. Reliable data is crucial for setting benchmarks, identifying gaps, and evaluating the success of policies and initiatives.

5. Conclusion:
While significant progress has been made towards achieving SDG 9, there is still a long way to go. Addressing the challenges of financing, technology, capacity building, and data collection is essential for realizing the full potential of infrastructure development and inclusive industrialization. Collaborative efforts from governments, development institutions like MIGA, private sector companies, and civil society organizations are necessary to create an enabling environment and ensure that no one is left behind in this journey towards sustainable development.
