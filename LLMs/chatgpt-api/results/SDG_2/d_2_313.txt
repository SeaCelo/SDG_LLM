Executive Summary

This report provides an in-depth analysis of Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) â€“ Zero Hunger, as part of the efforts undertaken by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). SDG 2 aims to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture worldwide by 2030. This report examines the current state of SDG 2, identifies areas of progress, highlights challenges, and provides recommendations for achieving the goal.

Introduction

SDG 2 focuses on eradicating hunger and ensuring access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food for every human being globally. With nearly 690 million people still suffering from hunger and malnutrition globally, this goal remains a significant challenge. However, progress has been made, and this report aims to shed light on those accomplishments while identifying areas for improvement.

Progress Made and Current Challenges

1. Hunger and Food Insecurity: Substantial progress has been made over the past decade toward reducing global hunger rates. The number of undernourished individuals has declined from 930 million in 2000 to about 690 million in 2019. Despite this improvement, conflicts, natural disasters, climate change, and socioeconomic inequalities remain major impediments to achieving zero hunger.

2. Malnutrition and Nutrition: While significant strides have been made in improving dietary diversity, more emphasis is needed on addressing malnutrition in all its forms. Estimates suggest that over 149 million children under 5 are stunted, which permanently hampers their physical and cognitive development. Furthermore, overweight and obesity rates are rising in many countries due to increasing consumption of processed foods and unhealthy diets.

3. Sustainable Agriculture: Sustainable agricultural practices are vital for achieving SDG 2. Many countries have embraced climate-smart agriculture, organic farming, and agroecology principles to improve soil fertility, conserve water resources, and reduce chemical inputs. However, the adoption of these practices is not widespread, primarily due to insufficient knowledge transfers, inadequate infrastructure, and financial constraints.

4. Rural Development and Small-scale Farmers: Rural areas, home to a significant proportion of the world's poor and undernourished populations, require targeted interventions to enhance food security. Investing in rural infrastructure, agricultural training, and inclusive rights and property tenure systems for small-scale farmers harnesses their potential for transforming food systems and reducing poverty.

5. Climate Change and Resilience: Climate change disrupts agricultural production and exacerbates food insecurity. Addressing climate challenges through climate-adaptive practices and enhancing the resilience of vulnerable populations are stratagems crucial for achieving SDG 2. Developing climate risk contingency plans, providing insurance schemes, and integrating climate-smart techniques can effectively reduce vulnerability.

Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are suggested to accelerate progress toward SDG 2:

1. Strengthen Collaboration: Foster stronger partnerships and collaboration between governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector to enhance the effectiveness of hunger eradication efforts.

2. Invest in Agricultural Innovation: Increase investment in research and development for sustainable agriculture, including climate-smart practices, precision farming, and capacity-building for small-scale farmers.

3. Enhance Market Access: Improve farmers' access to local, regional, and global markets through investment in infrastructure, transport, and logistics networks.

4. Promote Women Empowerment: Prioritize gender equality in agriculture by improving access to resources, training, and capacity-building opportunities for women farmers, who form the majority of small-scale farmers.

5. Strengthen Social Protection Systems: Develop and scale up social safety nets, including cash transfer programs and subsidized food schemes, to enhance food security, particularly for vulnerable populations during crises or shocks.

Conclusion

SDG 2, although challenging, is attainable with heightened collective efforts and strategic actions. By prioritizing adequate nutrition, sustainability, and resilience, countries can align their policies and interventions for a transformative approach to end hunger and promote sustainable agriculture. Through enhanced collaboration, investment, inclusivity, and innovation, the international community, including Canada, can accelerate progress and contribute to achieving SDG 2 by 2030.
