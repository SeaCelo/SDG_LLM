The Current State and Analytical Assessment of SDG 2:
 "Zero Hunger"
Reported by the United Nations Children's Fund

Introduction:

The Sustainable Development Goal 2, also known as "Zero Hunger," is aimed at defying the persistent challenge of food insecurity that affects millions of individuals and communities worldwide. The United Nations acknowledges the crucial interlinkages between hunger, poverty, inequality, gender disparity, conflict, and climate change in the pursuit of long-term solutions to achieving Zero Hunger. This analytical report intends to provide an expert assessment of the current status and progress made towards realizing SDG 2, as well as highlight the persistent challenges that remain.

1. Current Global Scenario:

(a) Prevalence of Hunger: Despite commendable progress in the past few decades, hunger continues to persist. According to the most recent UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates, the number of undernourished people globally rose for the third consecutive year in 2020, reaching a staggering 690 million. This alarming trend has been further exacerbated by the socio-economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

(b) Regional Disparities: Hunger and food insecurity vary significantly across regions. Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia are the most affected, with more than half of the global undernourished population residing in these regions. Conflict zones, fragile states, and areas prone to climate change-induced disasters face the most severe food crises, undermining efforts to achieve Zero Hunger.

2. Progress and Achievements:

(a) Reduction of Prevalence: SDG 2 has stimulated significant progress in recent years. Between 2000 and 2020, the global prevalence of undernourished people decreased from nearly 15% to under 9%, despite a growth in the global population. This achievement showcases the positive impact of coordinated efforts.

(b) Improved Nutrition: Efforts to tackle hidden hunger and malnutrition have yielded substantial results. Micronutrient deficiencies, such as stunting in children under the age of five, have seen a statistically significant decline. Additionally, initiatives promoting exclusive breastfeeding have been more successful, contributing to improved child nutrition.

(c) Sustainable Agriculture: Agricultural production has witnessed positive trends, thanks to an increased global focus on sustainable practices. The adoption of climate-smart techniques, such as conservation agriculture and agroforestry, has enhanced productivity while conserving resources and improving resilience.

3. Persistent Challenges:

(a) Fragility and Conflicts: Conflict exacerbates food insecurity, disrupts food systems, and displaces populations, hindering progress towards Zero Hunger in affected regions. Close collaboration with peacekeeping and humanitarian actors to ensure access to food, improve resilience, and facilitate durable solutions is critical.

(b) Climate Change: Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns significantly impact agricultural productivity, exacerbating hunger and food insecurity. Adaptation and mitigation strategies must be prioritized, ensuring vulnerable communities are equipped to withstand climate-related shocks.

(c) Inequalities and Discrimination: Structural inequalities perpetuate hunger, and disadvantaged groups, particularly women and girls, face increased vulnerability. Addressing gender disparities and promoting women's empowerment in agriculture, land rights, and decision-making processes is vital for achieving SDG 2.

(d) Post-Pandemic Recovery: The COVID-19 pandemic has sent shockwaves across the globe, disrupting food systems, exacerbating poverty, and increasing vulnerability to hunger. Building back better requires a holistic approach that prioritizes food security, restoring economic stability, and addressing the underlying social determinants of food insecurity.

Conclusion:

While significant progress has been made towards achieving SDG 2: Zero Hunger, numerous challenges persist that demand urgent action. This analytical report has highlighted the interconnected elements of the goal, such as conflict, climate change, inequality, and sustainable agricultural practices, that must be addressed collectively to truly overcome food insecurity. The United Nations Children's Fund, along with partners from multilateral organizations, governments, civil society, and the private sector, must continue their unwavering commitment towards realizing Zero Hunger and ensuring a sustainable future for all.
