SDG 2: Achieving Zero Hunger - An Analytical Report by the International Labour Organization

Background:
The International Labour Organization (ILO) presents this detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 2, aiming to eradicate hunger and ensure access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food for all. This report focuses on the current progress, challenges, and opportunities in achieving SDG 2 targets. It targets experts, policymakers, and practitioners in the field of development.

Overview of Current Status:

1. Global Hunger Levels:
Although progress has been made in reducing global hunger, the latest evidence indicates an alarming reversal. Currently, about 690 million people suffer from chronic undernourishment, and the situation has compounded due to factors such as conflict, climate change, economic slowdown, and now the COVID-19 pandemic. To achieve Zero Hunger by 2030, efforts need to be intensified.

2. Malnutrition:
The prevalence of all forms of malnutrition remains significant, with over 2 billion people experiencing nutritional deficiencies. Insufficient access to affordable, diverse, and nutritious food exacerbates the prevalence of stunting, wasting, and micronutrient deficiencies, particularly in vulnerable populations, children, and women.

3. Agricultural Productivity:
Increased agricultural productivity is vital to tackle hunger and ensure food security. Currently, productivity growth is varied, with several regions experiencing decline due to limited access to inputs, capital, and technology, fragile ecosystems, dearth of agriculturally competent labor, and lack of resilient farming practices.

4. Climate Change and Food Systems:
The Impact of climate change on agriculture exacerbates the challenges faced in attaining Sustainable Development Goal 2. Extreme weather events, including droughts, floods, and temperature fluctuations, have adverse effects on crop production, livelihoods, and food availability. Climate-resilient food systems are fundamental to achieving global food security.

Challenges and Opportunities:

1. Inclusive Growth and Decent Work:
Increasing agricultural productivity is fundamental to SDG 2 achievement while facilitating inclusive growth and decent work. Enhancing the agricultural sector's productivity, particularly in developing countries, can generate employment opportunities while providing access to better livelihoods. Buttressing decent work in rural areas will contribute to poverty reduction and food security outcomes.

2. Gender Equality:
Empowering women in agricultural value chains is key to addressing SDG 2 deficiencies. Women comprise a significant proportion of small-scale farmers and farm workers, yet they encounter barriers such as gender discriminatory norms, limited access to productive resources, and markets. Creating an enabling environment through targeted policies and interventions will unlock their potential and enhance food security outcomes.

3. Sustainable Agriculture:
Promoting sustainable agriculture practices aligns with the broader objectives of SDG 2 and other environmental conservation targets. Sustainable farming techniques, such as agroforestry, organic farming, conservation agriculture, and integrated pest management, can ensure increased productivity, biodiversity conservation, natural resource preservation, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.

4. Social Protection:
Implementing social protection measures, including conditional cash transfers, school feeding programs, and public works schemes, provides an effective safety net for the most vulnerable populations. Well-designed social protection initiatives improve short-term food security, resilience, and notably enhance investment in human capital.

Enhancing Collaboration:

1. Multisectoral Collaboration:
Eradicating hunger requires integrated and concerted efforts from various stakeholders across sectors, such as agriculture, healthcare, education, and finance. Effective coordination, exchange of best practices, and learning across countries and regions are crucial to achieve synergies and optimize available resources.

2. Global Partnerships:
Promoting strategic partnerships between governments, international organizations, civil society organizations, and the private sector can leverage expertise, financial resources, and technical capabilities for SDG 2 implementation. Strong international collaboration facilitates knowledge transfer, encourages innovation, and accelerates progress towards Zero Hunger.

Conclusion:

To achieve SDG 2 and eradicate hunger by 2030, comprehensive actions are required at both the national and international levels. Enhancing agricultural productivity, promoting sustainable farming practices, gender equality in agriculture, and social protection measures are critical strategies. Moreover, addressing the adverse effects of climate change on food systems is imperative.

By fostering inclusive growth, decent work, and multisectoral collaborative approaches, we can make significant strides towards eliminating hunger and ensuring food security for all. The International Labour Organization calls upon all stakeholders to act urgently, innovatively, and decisively to build a more resilient and prosperous future for generations to come.
