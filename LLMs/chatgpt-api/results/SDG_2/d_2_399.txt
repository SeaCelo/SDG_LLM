BRAC: Analytical Report on SDG 2 - Zero Hunger

Introduction:
The Sustainable Development Goal 2 aims to achieve zero hunger, end all forms of malnutrition, and ensure sustainable food production systems by 2030. As a leading development organization committed to poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor, BRAC has been at the forefront of addressing hunger and food security issues. This report provides a detailed analysis of the current status of SDG 2 implementation, highlighting the progress made, challenges faced, and recommendations to achieve the goal with a particular focus on BRAC's experience and approach towards ending hunger.

Progress and Achievements:
Over the past years, significant progress has been made towards reducing global hunger. However, with the emergence of multiple challenges such as climate change, conflicts, and socio-economic inequalities, achieving zero hunger by 2030 remains a considerable challenge.

To tackle this issue, BRAC has been employing a multi-dimensional approach to address both the immediate needs and underlying causes of hunger. The organization has successfully implemented various interventions such as agricultural interventions, climate-resilient farming practices, nutrition programs, and sustainable livelihood initiatives. These efforts have shown tangible results in reducing malnutrition rates and improving food security for vulnerable populations and marginalized communities.

Additionally, BRAC's innovative programs have included microfinance and social enterprise models to empower smallholder farmers, promote sustainable agriculture, and strengthen market linkages. By integrating smallholder farmers into value chains, reducing post-harvest losses, and enhancing access to markets, these initiatives have increased farmers' incomes and productivity while ensuring food security and nutrition for local communities.

Challenges and Unresolved Issues:
Despite the remarkable progress, challenges persist in achieving SDG 2. Climate change-induced extreme weather events, rising food prices, and inadequate investment in agriculture remain significant hurdles. Inequitable access to land, water, and natural resources further exacerbate hunger and malnutrition, particularly among marginalized communities.

In the rural areas where BRAC operates, limited infrastructure, low agricultural productivity, and lack of access to markets often hinder progress. Moreover, conflicts, humanitarian crises, and the displacement of populations create additional barriers to achieving sustainable food security.

The impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic poses new challenges to nutrition and food security. Disruptions to supply chains, loss of livelihoods, and limited access to essential services and dietary diversity have increased vulnerability to hunger and malnutrition, particularly among women and children.

Recommendations and BRAC's Role:
To overcome the challenges, a comprehensive approach is required that addresses the root causes of hunger and malnutrition. BRAC suggests the following recommendations:

1. Governance and Policies: Strengthen national and global governance frameworks to prioritize and address hunger and food security. Policy coordination across sectors, integration of climate change adaptation strategies, and sustainable agricultural practices need to be prioritized.

2. Investment in Agriculture and Value Chain Development: Increase investment in agriculture, including research and development, infrastructure development, and market integration. Promote inclusive business models that empower smallholders farmers, enhance access to credit and technology, and incorporate climate-smart practices.

3. Social Safety Nets and Targeted Interventions: Strengthen safety net programs to protect vulnerable populations and provide social protection schemes that ensure a minimum standard of living. Innovative programs, such as conditional cash transfers and school feeding programs, can enhance nutrition and food security for marginalized communities.

4. Climate-resilient Agriculture: Promote climate-smart agriculture practices that enhance productivity, increase adaptive capacity, and minimize the negative environmental impacts of farming. Invest in climate-resilient infrastructure, water management systems, and promote the use of renewable energy for sustainable agricultural practices.

BRAC, with its extensive experience, multi-sectoral approach, and community-led interventions, has demonstrated its role as a leading organization in achieving SDG 2. BRAC's focus on empowering smallholder farmers, providing targeted nutrition programs, promoting sustainable agriculture practices, and enhancing market linkages has been successful in addressing hunger and malnutrition at the grassroots level. Given its track record, BRAC's expertise and collaboration with governments, donors, and other stakeholders are crucial for the accelerated progress towards zero hunger.

Conclusion:
While progress on SDG 2 has been significant, the challenges to achieving zero hunger demand concerted efforts and effective collaborations. BRAC's innovative and community-centric interventions have showcased their impact in reducing hunger and malnutrition. By scaling up successful models, advocating for policy changes, and continuing to prioritize investment in agriculture, food security and nutrition, SDG 2 can be achieved, ultimately creating a world where everyone has access to adequate and nutritious food.
