The Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN) is pleased to present this detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) â€“ Zero Hunger. This report aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the current state of SDG 2, focusing on its targets and indicators, and assessing the progress made towards achieving the goal. The report is tailored for an expert audience in the field of sustainable development.

SDG 2 seeks to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030. It builds on the progress made under the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which aimed to reduce hunger and poverty globally. However, the scope of SDG 2 goes beyond the MDGs by emphasizing the need for sustainable agricultural practices and ensuring access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food for all.

To measure progress towards SDG 2, several targets and indicators have been identified. Target 2.1 focuses on ending hunger and achieving food security, targeting indicators such as the prevalence of undernourishment, the prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity, and the proportion of the population below the international poverty threshold.

Despite some progress made in recent years, the world still faces major challenges in achieving SDG 2. According to the latest data, the prevalence of undernourishment rose from 8.9% in 2015 to 9.2% in 2017, equivalent to nearly 690 million people suffering from hunger. This increase is mainly attributed to conflicts, natural disasters, and climate change, which undermine food production and disrupt access to resources.

In addition to hunger, the report highlights the issue of food insecurity, which affects an estimated 820 million people worldwide. Vulnerable groups such as children, women, and rural communities are disproportionately impacted. The prevalence of moderate to severe food insecurity in low and middle-income countries remains alarmingly high at around 22%.

Ensuring access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food for all is another critical aspect of SDG 2. Malnutrition remains a pervasive problem, with approximately 2 billion people suffering from micronutrient deficiencies or overweight and obesity. An estimated 45% of deaths among children under five are linked to inadequate nutrition.

Sustainable agriculture is also a key focus of SDG 2. It encompasses various indicators such as agricultural productivity and the adoption of sustainable practices. While agricultural productivity has seen some improvement, particularly in developing countries, challenges such as limited access to modern technology, inadequate infrastructure, and climate-related risks persist.

Furthermore, the report highlights the important role of small-scale farmers in achieving SDG 2. They account for a significant proportion of the world's food production and are essential in ensuring food security at the local level. However, small-scale farmers often face numerous challenges, including limited access to resources, lack of market access, and vulnerability to climate change impacts.

To address these challenges, the report outlines various initiatives undertaken by AKDN to promote SDG 2. The Network has implemented numerous projects that focus on enhancing agricultural productivity, promoting climate-resilient practices, strengthening value chains, and improving market access for small-scale farmers. These initiatives integrate innovative approaches such as agroforestry, precision agriculture, and digital technologies to enhance overall agricultural sustainability.

Lastly, the report emphasizes the need for effective partnerships among governments, civil society organizations, and the private sector to accelerate progress towards SDG 2. Collaboration and knowledge sharing are crucial for developing targeted interventions, improving policy coherence, and mobilizing resources to combat hunger and food insecurity.

In conclusion, while progress has been made towards achieving SDG 2, significant challenges remain in ensuring zero hunger, food security, and sustainable agriculture. This report highlights the current state of SDG 2, identifies areas requiring immediate attention, and showcases the role of AKDN in promoting sustainable development in line with SDG 2. It is hoped that this analytical report will contribute to the collective efforts aimed at achieving a world free from hunger and malnutrition.
