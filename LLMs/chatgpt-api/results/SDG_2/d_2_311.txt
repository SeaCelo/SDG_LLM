Belgian Policy Plan for Development Cooperation
Analytical Report on Sustainable Development Goal 2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture

Executive Summary:
This report provides an in-depth analysis of Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2): "End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture." The objective of this report is to outline the current state of progress towards achieving SDG 2, highlight key challenges, assess the role of the Belgian Policy Plan for Development Cooperation in addressing these challenges, and present recommendations for further action. The report aims to inform an expert audience on the various aspects of SDG 2 and stimulate collective efforts towards its realization.

Introduction:
SDG 2 is a critical goal of the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, emphasizing the importance of eradicating hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture. It recognizes that access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food is a basic human right and a fundamental prerequisite for human well-being, poverty reduction, and sustainable development.

Current State of Progress:
Despite significant advancements in several aspects, the current progress towards achieving SDG 2 is not sufficient. The number of undernourished people increased from 785 million in 2015 to 822 million in 2019, while the simultaneous rise in extreme weather events and the COVID-19 pandemic have further exacerbated food insecurity and malnutrition.

Challenges:
Various complex challenges pose obstacles to the accomplishment of SDG 2. These challenges include conflict and insecurity, inadequate access to sufficient and nutritious food, changing dietary patterns, environmental degradation, limited agricultural productivity, and lack of investment in agricultural research and rural infrastructure.

Role of Belgian Policy Plan for Development Cooperation:
The Belgian government, through its Policy Plan for Development Cooperation, has recognized the centrality of SDG 2 and undertaken various initiatives to address the aforementioned challenges. Belgium supports global and country-level efforts to strengthen agricultural productivity, resilience to climate change, and establish sustainable food systems. Key interventions include bilateral cooperation, multilateral partnerships, funding mechanisms, knowledge sharing, capacity building, and policy dialogue.

Recommendations:
To effectively contribute to achieving SDG 2, it is imperative for Belgium to intensify its efforts in the following areas:

1. Strengthening Resilience: Promoting climate-smart agriculture, investing in climate adaptation strategies, and strengthening the resilience of smallholder farmers to climate change-induced shocks.

2. Supporting Smallholder Farmers: Enhancing support for small-scale farmers through social protection programs, access to finance, technology transfer, and capacity building initiatives to enhance productivity, diversification, and market access.

3. Encouraging Sustainable Production: Promoting sustainable agricultural practices, such as organic farming, agroecology, and diversification of production systems, to ensure global food security while minimizing environmental impacts.

4. Engaging in Research and Development: Increasing investment in agricultural research, technology innovation, and knowledge-sharing platforms to address productivity gaps, enhance nutritional value, and develop sustainable agricultural practices tailored to local contexts.

5. Improving Nutrition: Enhancing efforts to ensure access to safe and nutritious food for all, particularly for vulnerable groups, by supporting nutrition-sensitive agriculture, school feeding programs, and nutrition education.

Conclusion:
The achievement of SDG 2 requires unprecedented collective action at local, national, regional, and global levels. Belgium has a crucial role to play in supporting sustainable agriculture, enhancing food security, and ensuring improved nutrition. By implementing the recommendations outlined in this report and continuing to prioritize SDG 2, Belgium can significantly contribute to the overall global efforts and ultimately help build a more sustainable and inclusive world.
