Save the Children: Analytical Report on Sustainable Development Goal 2

Introduction

This report delves into the pursuit of Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) - Zero Hunger, which aims to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. As an expert audience, it is important to understand the prevailing challenges and achievements around SDG 2 and the critical actions required to fulfill this goal. Save the Children takes a comprehensive approach to analyze the current state of SDG 2.

Current Global Situation

Despite substantial progress over the years, the world still grapples with hunger and malnutrition. According to the 2021 United Nations Food Security and Nutrition report, an alarming 811 million people faced hunger in 2020, up 161 million from 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated these challenges, highlighting the need for urgent action and resources.

Key Challenges

1. Insufficient agricultural development: Many countries lack sufficient agricultural infrastructure, technologies, and training, preventing them from achieving sustainable and productive agriculture systems. Limited access to arable land, water scarcity, and climate change-related disruptions also compound these challenges.

2. Food waste and loss: Approximately one-third of the food produced globally, worth around $990 billion, goes to waste each year. Strengthening post-harvest management, improving storage facilities, and reducing food loss across the agricultural value chain are imperative to ensure food reaches those who need it most.

3. Persistent malnutrition: Malnutrition remains a significant challenge, affecting the health and futures of millions. Undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, and rising levels of overweight and obesity are critical public health concerns that undermine human potential and economic development.

Successful Initiatives and Promising Practices

While the challenges are substantial, notable progress has been made under SDG 2:

1. Strong institutional frameworks: The Committee on World Food Security, World Food Program, and International Fund for Agricultural Development play pivotal roles in shaping global policies, mobilizing resources, and coordinating actions to achieve Zero Hunger. Such frameworks foster collaboration and harmonize efforts.

2. Innovative agricultural practices: Several transformative approaches have emerged to enhance agricultural productivity and sustainability. These encompass agroecology, precision farming, conservation agriculture, and the integration of technology, enabling farmers to maximize yields with minimal environmental impacts.

3. Social protection systems: Governments and non-governmental organizations have implemented various social protection measures to reduce hunger and malnutrition. Cash transfer programs, school feeding initiatives, and tailored nutrition interventions have contributed to improved food security and child health outcomes.

Recommendations

To accelerate progress towards SDG 2, several strategic actions need to be prioritized:

1. Foster agricultural research and development: Governments should increase investments in agricultural research and development, aiming to develop climate-resilient crops, improve productivity, and promote sustainable farming practices. This includes supporting smallholder farmers with access to modern technologies, training, and credit.

2. Strengthen food systems: Countries need to enhance the efficiency and resilience of their food systems to overcome challenges such as food waste. This can be achieved through improved storage facilities, streamlined value chains, strengthened post-harvest management, and effective market information systems.

3. Tackle malnutrition holistically: Timely and sustained investments in nutrition-sensitive interventions are key. Integrated approaches should focus on improving breastfeeding rates, fortifying staple foods, promoting diversified diets, and tackling childhood obesity through comprehensive education campaigns and regulations on unhealthy food marketing.

4. Scale-up social protection programs: Governments should prioritize expanding and scaling up proven social protection programs. This includes cash transfers, school feeding initiatives, and nutrition-specific interventions to ensure vulnerable populations have access to a quality diet and essential healthcare services.

Conclusion

SDG 2 emphasizes the urgent need for collective effort to overcome hunger, malnutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. To achieve Zero Hunger by 2030, implementing innovative agricultural practices, fortified by strong institutional frameworks and social protection systems, is crucial. By prioritizing these actions, it is possible to redirect the trajectory towards a world where every child and family has access to nutritious food, ensuring a sustenance of life, dignity, and development for all.
