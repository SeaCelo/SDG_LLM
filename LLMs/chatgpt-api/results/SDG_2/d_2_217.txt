Efforts to achieve sustainable development in the world today face numerous challenges, with many people grappling with critical issues on a daily basis, such as hunger, malnourishment, and poverty. The global development agenda has recognized the significance of these interlinked challenges, and consequently, the second Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) was formulated with the intention of addressing these issues head-on. SDG 2 aims to "End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture" by the year 2030.

In order to delve deeper into the multifaceted nature of SDG 2, it is imperative to adopt an analytical lens that is grounded in economic and financial considerations. This article will explore the various dimensions of this goal, taking inspiration from the academic views espoused by Eugene F. Fama Sr., an eminent economist known for his work on market efficiency and the efficient market hypothesis.

SDG 2 has three key targets. Firstly, it seeks to eradicate hunger and ensure access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food for all. Achieving universal food security calls for collective action, as persistent hunger affects almost every aspect of an individual's well-being, leading to reduced productivity, weakened cognitive abilities, and higher vulnerability to diseases. Food security is intertwined with the socio-economic fabric of nations, and understanding the various dimensions involved is essential.

From an economic standpoint, Prof. Fama's efficiency paradigm can guide us. Institutions that promote free markets, promote open trade, and enhance the efficiency of distribution channels allow for better resource allocation, ultimately leading to higher agricultural productivity and food security. This aligns with Adam Smith's "invisible hand" theory, which highlights the importance of self-interested actions in achieving overall societal welfare and prosperity.

Secondly, SDG 2 addresses malnutrition due to the inadequate availability and consumption of diverse, nutritious food. Malnutrition affects individuals across the lifespan, impeding physical and cognitive development, reducing productivity, and increasing susceptibility to illnesses. Conventional economists argue that achieving better nutrition necessitates economists and policymakers to consider the interactions between consumers and producers along with the market mechanisms.

Taking a cue from Prof. Fama's contribution to market efficiency research, we can emphasize the importance of a well-functioning agricultural supply chain, from farm to fork, that allows for the efficient production, processing, distribution, and sale of nutritious food. Incentivizing actors in the agricultural sector by enabling fair market prices for produce can drive investment in sustainable agriculture practices and ensure a stable supply of nutritious food.

The third target of SDG 2 is to promote sustainable and resilient agricultural practices that increase productivity and production, thereby contributing to long-term food security. Agricultural productivity is shaped by a myriad of factors, such as access to quality inputs, knowledge transfer, technological innovation, and financial support systems.

Prof. Fama's insights can be an invaluable asset in comprehending the financial dimensions of sustainable agriculture. He argues that in order to attract investments, the agricultural sector should offer transparent and reliable information on the costs, risks, and potential returns on investments. Policymakers and researchers need to work collaboratively to develop financial mechanisms, such as agricultural bonds or climate-risk insurance, which can enable farmers to access vital funds to adopt sustainable practices and mitigate the impacts of climate change risks.

Furthermore, the integration of financial markets in the agricultural sector can provide opportunities for small-scale farmers to access credit and enable risk-sharing across the value chains. Innovative financial instruments, such as microcredit facilities or green bonds, can play a significant role in bridging the financing gap and engaging private-sector investors in sustainable agriculture ventures.

In conclusion, the second Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 2) entails a comprehensive approach towards achieving food security, improving nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture. By applying Eugene F. Fama Sr.'s academic insights in the field of economic and financial analyses, we can gain a nuanced understanding of the multi-faceted challenges embedded within this goal.

To address hunger and malnutrition, it is crucial to promote market efficiency, open trade, and fair pricing mechanisms whilst ensuring a reliable and resilient agricultural supply chain. The integration of financial instruments and markets, guided by Prof. Fama's principles, can unlock necessary investments and provide small-scale farmers with access to credit. The realization of SDG 2 relies on multidisciplinary collaborations, with economists and policymakers working hand-in-hand to tackle the complex nexus of food security, nutrition, and sustainable agriculture to ensure a better future for all.
