Executive Summary

This analytical report provides an in-depth analysis of Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) - End Hunger, Achieve Food Security, and Improved Nutrition, and Promote Sustainable Agriculture. It is prepared by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and targets an expert audience. The report highlights the current status, progress, challenges, and opportunities in achieving SDG 2 and offers recommendations for key stakeholders to accelerate progress.

Introduction

SDG 2 focuses on ending hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture. With a global population expected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, the need for sustainable food systems has never been more critical. Today, nearly 690 million people suffer from chronic hunger, while 3 billion people cannot afford a healthy diet. Therefore, achieving zero hunger by 2030 requires coordinated actions from governments, civil society, academia, and the private sector.

Current Status and Progress

Despite progress, significant challenges remain in achieving SDG 2. By 2019, global hunger had increased for three consecutive years, affecting close to 690 million people. Climate change, conflicts, and economic downturns pose substantial threats to food security, further aggravating the situation. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these challenges, leading to disruptions in food supply chains and increased vulnerability.

However, certain regions have demonstrated notable progress. Latin America and the Caribbean have reduced the prevalence of undernourishment, while Eastern and Southeastern Asia have achieved significant gains in reducing hunger. Additionally, successful experiences in countries like Brazil, China, and Ethiopia highlight the importance of inclusive policies, investments in agriculture, and social protection programs.

Challenges and Opportunities

Several challenges hinder the achievement of SDG 2. Climate change, including changing rainfall patterns and extreme weather events, negatively impacts crop yields and threatens food security. Limited access to financial resources for smallholder farmers, particularly women and youth, hampers their ability to adopt sustainable farming practices and increase productivity. Conflicts and political instability disrupt farming activities and undermine food systems.

Amidst these challenges lie remarkable opportunities. Advancements in technology, such as precision agriculture, remote sensing, and data analytics, offer innovative solutions to boost agricultural productivity while conserving resources. Enhancing investment in rural infrastructure, from irrigation systems to storage facilities, can improve efficiency, reduce losses, and enable farmers to connect to markets. Promoting sustainable and resilient agriculture practices, including agroecology and conservation agriculture, can enhance productivity while protecting the environment.

Recommendations

To accelerate progress towards SDG 2, key stakeholders must take collective actions. Governments should prioritize integrating food security and nutrition into national policies, scaling up social protection programs, and empowering smallholder farmers through access to credit, land, and technology. Investments in rural development, including agricultural research and extension services, are crucial to enhance productivity and resilience.

International cooperation is vital to enable knowledge sharing, financial assistance, and capacity building. Donor countries must fulfill their commitments to provide official development assistance for agriculture and rural development, especially in the most vulnerable regions. Civil society organizations can advocate for more inclusive and sustainable food systems, fostering engagement and partnerships among various stakeholders.

Conclusion

SDG 2 remains a significant challenge as hunger and food insecurity persist worldwide. Nonetheless, by recognizing the complexity of these issues, harnessing technology, and committing to collaborative approaches, it is possible to address the root causes of hunger and transform current food systems. Achieving SDG 2 presents an opportunity to secure a better future for generations to come, ensuring sustainable and equitable access to nutritious food for all.
