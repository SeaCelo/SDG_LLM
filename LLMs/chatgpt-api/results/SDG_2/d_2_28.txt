1. Introduction

Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2), titled "Zero Hunger", aims to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030. This report provides a detailed analysis of SDG 2, with a specific focus on its progress and challenges in achieving the targets in least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs). 

2. Current Situation

2.1 Hunger and Food Insecurity: LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs continue to face severe challenges in tackling hunger and food insecurity. Persistent conflicts, climate change, natural disasters, limited access to resources, and underdeveloped agricultural systems contribute to the prevalence of hunger in these countries. These challenges are exacerbated by weak governance, inadequate infrastructure, and limited financial and technical resources, making it difficult to implement effective policies and programs.

2.2 Malnutrition: Malnutrition remains a critical issue in LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs. Both undernutrition and overnutrition pose significant challenges to the achievement of SDG 2. Limited access to diverse and nutritious food, poor healthcare, inadequate sanitation, and lack of education on nutrition exacerbate the problem. Moreover, climate change impacts, such as droughts or cyclones, further deteriorate the nutritional status of vulnerable populations.

2.3 Sustainable Agriculture: Transforming conventional agriculture into a sustainable and resilient system is crucial for ensuring food security and achieving SDG 2. However, LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs face challenges such as limited access to modern farming technologies, lack of market infrastructure, weak land tenure systems, and the expansion of cash crop monocultures. Climate change-induced impacts, including changing rainfall patterns and increased pest prevalence, are further diminishing agricultural productivity.

3. Progress and Challenges in Achieving SDG 2

3.1 Progress in LDCs: Some LDCs have made commendable progress towards achieving SDG 2 targets. Government-led initiatives, such as investments in agricultural infrastructure, market development, and nutrition programs, have improved food availability and access. Examples include successfully establishing school feeding programs and promoting smallholder farming initiatives. Collaboration among stakeholders, including civil society, private sector, and international organizations, has also yielded positive results.

3.2 Challenges in LDCs: Despite these efforts, attaining SDG 2 targets remains a formidable challenge for LDCs. The prevalence of conflicts and political instability hampers efforts to address hunger and food security comprehensively. Weak governance and fragile institutions limit the effective implementation of policies, while underinvestment in agriculture restricts productivity improvement. Climate change impacts, such as droughts and floods, destroy crops and exacerbate food insecurity in these vulnerable countries.

3.3 Progress in SIDS: SIDS have demonstrated innovative approaches to address the diverse challenges of achieving SDG 2. Some SIDS have established climate-resilient agriculture practices that prioritize local food production and reduce dependence on imports. Collaborative efforts among SIDS in the Pacific, Caribbean, and Indian Ocean regions have helped develop and implement regional policies to improve food security. Additionally, renewable energy initiatives have created opportunities for sustainable agriculture.

3.4 Challenges in SIDS: Despite progress, SIDS face numerous challenges in achieving SDG 2. Vulnerability to climate change, limited access to financing, and high dependency on external factors for food imports remain key obstacles. Disruption to global supply chains and high transport costs affect the availability and affordability of food in remote island communities. Strengthening resilience and adaptive capacity to climate change, ensuring sustainable use of marine resources, and addressing social inequities are critical for sustainable development in SIDS.

3.5 Progress in LLDCs: LLDCs have made efforts to address the unique challenges of landlocked environments and achieve SDG 2. Enhancing regional cooperation and connectivity has been an important strategy to improve access to markets and reduce transportation costs. Investment in infrastructure has helped address supply chain challenges by improving road and rail networks. In some cases, expanding irrigation systems and promoting climate-smart farming practices have increased agricultural production.

3.6 Challenges in LLDCs: Nevertheless, LLDCs face distinct challenges in achieving SDG 2 due to geographic disadvantages and limited access to services and resources. High transportation costs and trade barriers undermine the competitiveness of agricultural products from these countries. Land degradation, soil erosion, and water scarcity pose further challenges to agriculture. To overcome these barriers, investment in infrastructure connectivity, access to finance, and capacity building to promote sustainable agriculture needs to be prioritized.

4. Way Forward

Achieving SDG 2 in the LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs will require robust and coordinated efforts from governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector. The following strategies are crucial for making progress:

- Strengthen national institutions and improve governance to effectively implement policies and programs related to food security and nutrition.
- Increase investment in agriculture to enhance productivity, improve supply chain management, and build resilience against climate change impacts.
- Prioritize social protection programs to support the most vulnerable populations, ensuring they have access to adequate nutrition.
- Increase funding support from the international community to overcome the financial limitations faced by LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs.
- Foster regional and international cooperation to promote knowledge sharing, capacity building, and technology transfer to enhance agricultural productivity and sustainability.

By addressing these challenges and implementing these strategies, there is a real possibility of achieving SDG 2, ensuring zero hunger, improving food security, and promoting sustainable agriculture in LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs by 2030. This ambitious goal requires substantial efforts, collaboration, and innovative solutions that are specific to the unique needs of these countries. The international community must remain committed to resolving the complex issues related to hunger and malnutrition in the most vulnerable regions of the world.
