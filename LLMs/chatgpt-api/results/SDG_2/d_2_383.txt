Leveraging Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) to address food security challenges: An analytic overview towards sustainable and equitable global food systems

Executive Summary

This report offers an in-depth analysis of SDG 2 - Zero Hunger, to achieve an end to hunger, promote food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. With the target to eradicate all forms of malnutrition and double the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers by 2030, SDG 2 is crucial for achieving a sustainable and equitable future for all.

1. Introduction

Over the years, despite significant progress, the global food system still suffers from numerous challenges, including hunger, undernutrition, and unsustainable farming practices. SDG 2 acts as a roadmap towards building resilient food systems that can effectively tackle these challenges, ensuring the availability and access to safe and nutritious food for all. This report highlights the key elements and constraints of SDG 2, examines the current state of global food security, and provides insights on potential solutions to enhance the impact of SDG 2.

2. Understanding the Components of SDG 2

a. Hunger and nutrition: SDG 2 emphasizes the importance of eliminating hunger and malnutrition in all its forms. It recognizes that food security encompasses aspects beyond calorie intake, encompassing nutritional diversity, access to safe drinking water, sanitation, and healthcare.

b. Sustainable agriculture: SDG 2 promotes the shift towards sustainable agricultural practices. It encourages resilient and climate-smart farming techniques, biodiversity conservation, and the adoption of efficient and sustainable resource management practices.

c. Resilient food systems: Achieving sustainable and resilient food systems plays a pivotal role under SDG 2. This entails reducing post-harvest losses, improving infrastructure and storage facilities, enhancing rural transportation networks, and promoting sustainable and inclusive market access for small-scale food producers.

3. Current State of Global Food Security

a. Achievements: Remarkable progress has been made in reducing hunger and poverty levels globally. However, disparities persist, with higher rates of food insecurity and malnutrition prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia.

b. Challenges: The increasing global population, climate change impacts, and unsustainable farming practices pose significant challenges to achieving SDG 2. Other obstacles include inadequate agricultural infrastructure, limited access to financing and technology, lack of capacity building, and enduring gender inequalities in the agriculture sector.

4. Enhancing the Impact of SDG 2

a. Policy coherence: Coherence in policies and strategies across sectors is crucial to prioritize food security within national development plans. Effective governance and legislation can create an enabling environment for sustainable agriculture, eliminate market distortions, and empower marginalized groups.

b. Collaboration and coordination: Enhanced collaboration and coordination among governments, civil society organizations, research institutions, and the private sector is crucial to optimize the impact of SDG 2. Sharing of knowledge, data, and best practices, coupled with innovative financing mechanisms, can unlock new opportunities.

c. Sustainable farming practices: Shifting towards sustainable farming practices, such as agro-ecological approaches, precision agriculture, and regenerative agriculture, can bolster productivity while minimizing negative environmental impacts. Integrated pest management and responsible use of inputs can reduce chemical usage and protect biodiversity.

d. Targeted investments: Increasing investments in agricultural research and development, rural infrastructure, extension services, and technologies suitable for small-scale farmers are essential for achieving SDG 2. Providing access to financial services, credit, insurance, and market linkages empower smallholders to increase productivity and income.

e. Nutrition-sensitive agriculture: A systemic approach integrating nutrition considerations into agricultural practices can promote diversified and nutrient-rich diets. This includes promoting cultivation and consumption of traditional and underutilized crops and improving food safety practices.

5. Conclusion

SDG 2 offers a comprehensive framework to address the global food security challenge. By emphasizing the need for sustainable agriculture, resilient food systems, and inclusive policies, SDG 2 paves the way for a transformative change in our approach to nourishing people and protecting the planet. Urgent actions, effective partnerships, and prioritized investments are needed to make SDG 2 a reality, ensuring a world free from hunger where food security and sustainable agriculture are achieved for all.
