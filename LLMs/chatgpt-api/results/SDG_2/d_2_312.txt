Analytical Report on SDG 2: Zero Hunger

By Agência Brasileira de Cooperação

Introduction:

This analytical report aims to provide an in-depth examination of the progress and challenges related to Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2): Zero Hunger. As an expert audience, we understand the importance of achieving food security and ending all forms of malnutrition in order to eradicate hunger and promote sustainable agriculture. This report will focus on the current status of SDG 2, reviewing relevant indicators and interventions, employing comparative analysis to highlight disparities and emphasizing the Brazilian context.

Current Status of SDG 2:

SDG 2, adopted by United Nations member states in 2015, seeks to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030. Despite global efforts, the absolute number of undernourished individuals has increased recently, mainly due to conflicts, economic downturns, and climate-related disasters. As of 2019, an estimated 690 million people suffer from hunger worldwide. This alarming figure indicates the dire need to accelerate actions to achieve the targets of SDG 2.

Indicators and Targets:

To measure progress towards SDG 2, several indicators have been outlined. Firstly, the prevalence of undernourishment offers insight into the proportion of the population experiencing insufficient food intake. Secondly, the prevalence of stunting among children under five reflects chronic malnutrition, which has long-term detrimental effects on health and cognitive development. Lastly, the proportion of the population living in households following the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) measures individuals' access to nutritious and sufficient food. All of these indicators paint a comprehensive picture of the current state of hunger globally.

Comparative Analysis:

When examining the necessary interventions to achieve SDG 2, it is vital to understand the disparities between regions and countries. In this report, we emphasize the Brazilian context and compare it with other countries, thus providing an engaging analysis for the expert audience.

Brazil's Progress and Challenges:

Brazil has made significant progress towards achieving SDG 2. The country's most notable achievement is its ability to reduce both the prevalence of undernourishment and the proportion of stunted children in recent years. This success can be attributed to effective social programs, including Bolsa Família, a conditional cash transfer program, and the National School Feeding Program.

However, challenges remain, especially when viewed through a gender lens. Substantial disparities exist between men and women, with higher rates of food deprivation seen among women, particularly in rural and indigenous communities. Furthermore, the vulnerability of smallholder farmers and climate change impacts threaten agricultural sustainability and exacerbate hunger in certain parts of Brazil.

Best Practices from Other Countries:

Analyzing successful strategies implemented by other countries can provide valuable insights for Brazil's efforts. For instance, Thailand has demonstrated success in achieving zero hunger by implementing innovative policies and programs. These include the One Tambon, One Green and One Whole Village initiatives, which promote sustainable agriculture, regional food security, and community participation. Learning from these best practices and considering their adaptation to the Brazilian context is highly relevant to achieving SDG 2.

Conclusion:

Despite progress made in some areas, achieving SDG 2, Zero Hunger, still requires substantial global efforts. Brazil, as a key player, has shown promise with innovative solutions and targeted interventions. However, addressing gender disparities, promoting sustainability, and learning from successful strategies implemented in other countries are pivotal steps in accelerating progress. It is crucial for the expert audience to recognize these complex challenges and engage in a collective effort that champions international cooperation, knowledge sharing, and the mobilization of resources to ensure a hunger-free world by 2030.
