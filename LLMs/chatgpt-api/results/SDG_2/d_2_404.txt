At Centre for Safety and Development, we value the overarching goal of achieving sustainable development as outlined by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This report focuses on SDG 2 – Zero Hunger – which aims to end hunger, achieve food security and improve nutrition while promoting sustainable agriculture.

Overview:

SDG 2 recognizes and addresses the centrality of hunger and malnutrition as critical development challenges. Despite significant advancements in reducing global hunger over the past few decades, the World Food Programme estimates that over 690 million people still suffer from chronic hunger, and approximately 2 billion people experience moderate or severe food insecurity. Taking into account the expected population growth, the eradication of hunger poses an enormous challenge to global efforts in achieving sustainable development.

Root Causes:

The current situation of hunger and malnutrition is influenced by a complex array of interconnected factors. Poverty, conflicts, climate change, limited access to adequate resources, and inequalities are among the principal root causes undermining efforts to achieve SDG 2.

1. Poverty: Persistent poverty exacerbates hunger and malnutrition by limiting individuals' ability to afford nutritious food, impeding investments in appropriate agricultural practices and technologies, and reducing resilience to economic shocks.
2. Conflicts and Instability: Conflict and political instability disrupt food systems, displace populations, and inhibit sustained agricultural investment and development.
3. Climate Change: Changing climate patterns, including erratic rainfall, increased temperature, and more frequent extreme weather events, pose significant challenges to agriculture, especially for vulnerable regions.
4. Limited Access to Resources: Limited access to land, water, credit, and appropriate technologies hampers agricultural productivity and food security.
5. Inequalities: Gender inequalities, discrimination, and exclusion further exacerbate food insecurity, with women and various marginalized groups disproportionately affected.

Addressing the Challenges:

To achieve SDG 2, multifaceted approaches and coordinated efforts from governments, civil society, private sector stakeholders, and the international community are imperative. Key measures to consider include:

1. Sustainable Agricultural Practices: Promoting sustainable agricultural practices that ensure greater resilience to climate change, improve land productivity, enhance access to water and reduce waste.
2. Social Protection Systems: Strengthening social protection systems to provide safety nets, especially for vulnerable and marginalized groups, including women and children.
3. Enhancing Rural Development: Investing in rural areas by providing access to credit, training, and technologies, while promoting sustainable agriculture practices and income diversification.
4. Transparent and Inclusive Governance: Facilitating inclusive governance mechanisms that prioritize the voices of all stakeholders, ensure equitable access to resources, and foster responsible agricultural investments.
5. International Cooperation and Funding: Strengthening international cooperation and providing adequate financial resources to support national efforts toward achieving SDG 2.

Best Practices and Success Stories:

While the challenges remain formidable, several practices and initiatives can serve as inspirations in attaining SDG 2. The Brazilian Zero Hunger Program implemented from 2003 to 2015, helped lift millions of people out of extreme poverty and significantly reduced the number of undernourished individuals. Bangladesh's success in achieving food self-sufficiency through sustainable agricultural practices and investment in rural development showcases another positive example.

Conclusion:

SDG 2, with its emphasis on food security, sustainable agriculture, and improved nutrition, recognizes the critical importance of eradicating hunger for sustainable development. Addressing root causes such as poverty, conflict, inequalities, and climate change and implementing comprehensive and collaborative solutions are essential to achieving this goal. By harnessing international cooperation, investing in sustainable agricultural practices, and strengthening the social protection systems, we can make significant strides toward a hunger-free world and a more sustainable future for all.
