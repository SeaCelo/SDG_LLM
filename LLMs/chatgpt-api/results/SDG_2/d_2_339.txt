The Camões Instituto da Cooperação e da Língua has prepared an in-depth analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) - Zero Hunger. This report aims to provide an expert audience with a thorough understanding of the current state of SDG 2, its targets and indicators, the challenges faced, and progress made towards achieving this goal worldwide.

SDG 2, adopted by the UN in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, recognizes that ending hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture are paramount for achieving overall development. The main objective of SDG 2 is to ensure access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food for all, along with promoting sustainable agricultural practices, differentiating it from its predecessor, Millennium Development Goal 1.

To tackle the multi-faceted issue of hunger, SDG 2 establishes a set of targets that encompass key aspects of food security and sustainable agriculture. The targets associated with SDG 2 include:

1. Target 2.1: By 2030, end hunger and ensure access by all people, especially the poor and people in vulnerable situations, including infants, to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food.
2. Target 2.2: By 2030, end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving internationally agreed-upon targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women, and older persons.
3. Target 2.3: By 2030, double the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers, in particular women, indigenous peoples, family farmers, pastoralists and fishers, including through secure and equitable access to land, other productive resources and inputs, knowledge, financial services, markets and opportunities for value addition and non-farm employment.
4. Target 2.4: By 2030, ensure sustainable food production systems and implement resilient agricultural practices that increase productivity and production, that help maintain ecosystems, that strengthen capacity for adaptation to climate change, extreme weather, drought, flooding, and other disasters, and that progressively improve land and soil quality.
5. Target 2.5: By 2020, maintain the genetic diversity of seeds, cultivated plants and farmed and domesticated animals and their related wild species, including through soundly managed and diversified seed and plant banks at the national, regional, and international levels, and ensure access to and fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge, as internationally agreed.
6. Target 2.A: Increase investment, including through enhanced international cooperation, in rural infrastructure, agricultural research and extension services, technology development, and plant and livestock gene banks.
7. Target 2.B: Correct and prevent trade restrictions and distortions in world agricultural markets, including through the parallel elimination of all forms of agricultural export subsidies and all export measures with equivalent effect, in accordance with the mandate of the Doha Development Round.
8. Target 2.C: Adopt measures to ensure the proper functioning of food commodity markets and their derivatives, and facilitate timely access to market information, including on food reserves, in order to help limit extreme food price volatility.

Monitoring and evaluating the progress of SDG 2 is crucial for ensuring efficient and effective implementation efforts. To this end, various indicators have been established for each target. Some examples of these indicators are the prevalence of undernourishment, the stunting and wasting rates among children under 5, the proportion of population living in households with access to adequate food, and the proportion of women in agricultural employment.

While progress has been made towards achieving SDG 2, significant challenges persist. The world is currently facing increasing rates of hunger and malnutrition due to factors such as armed conflicts, mass displacement, climate change, and economic inequality. Achieving zero hunger requires overcoming these challenges and improving policies and programs that address the root causes of hunger, such as poverty, inadequate infrastructure, and unsustainable agricultural practices.

To accelerate progress towards SDG 2, international cooperation, partnerships, and investments are essential. Engaging governments, civil society organizations, private sector entities, and academia to work collaboratively is crucial for implementing innovative solutions and ensuring sustainable food systems globally. This cooperative approach also includes sharing best practices, promoting knowledge transfer, and empowering communities, especially women and marginalized groups, in decision-making processes related to food production and security.

In conclusion, SDG 2 represents a comprehensive framework and an unequivocal global commitment to addressing the complex challenges associated with food security, nutrition, and sustainable agriculture. Ensuring access to adequate food for all, combating malnutrition, empowering small-scale food producers, adopting resilient agricultural practices, and promoting fair trade policies are key pillars in turning this vision into a reality. Despite the significant challenges, concerted efforts by all actors involved can bring us closer to the ultimate goal of zero hunger by 2030. Our unwavering commitment to SDG 2 is imperative to building a more sustainable and equitable world for future generations.
