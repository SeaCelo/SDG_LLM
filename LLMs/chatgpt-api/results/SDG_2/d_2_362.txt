The Eurasian Development Bankâ€™s Report on Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger.

Introduction:

Zero Hunger, one of the Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the United Nations in 2015, strives to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030. This ambitious goal is aimed at addressing all forms of malnutrition, ensuring access to nutritious food, and fostering sustainable agricultural practices to enhance food production.

Analyzing the Current Progress:

1. Hunger and Undernourishment:
The report highlights that while significant progress has been made in reducing hunger, we still face immense challenges. In 2019, an estimated 690 million people  experienced chronic undernourishment. Moreover, conflicts, climate change, and economic instability have exacerbated food insecurity in many regions, hindering our path towards achieving Zero Hunger.

2. Food Access and Distribution:
To achieve SDG 2, it is vital to ensure adequate access to food for vulnerable populations. The report highlights that millions face difficulties in accessing nutritious and affordable food due to inequalities and barriers to trade and distribution. It becomes imperative to empower small-scale food producers, improve infrastructure, and promote inclusive markets to address these challenges effectively.

3. Malnutrition:
The report emphasizes the need to address all forms of malnutrition, including stunting, wasting, and obesity. Despite advancements in reducing undernourishment, approximately 144 million children under five were affected by stunting in 2019. Furthermore, the global rise in obesity poses a major public health challenge. Initiatives focusing on nutrition education, fortified food production, and policies targeting the reduction of processed food consumption are crucial to tackle these issues.

4. Sustainable Agriculture:
The report recognizes the importance of sustainable agriculture in achieving Zero Hunger. Sustainable agricultural practices are not only essential for ensuring food security but also for preserving ecosystems and biodiversity. By promoting climate-smart agriculture, increasing resilient crop varieties, conserving water, and reducing food waste, the goal of sustainable agricultural practices can be effectively pursued.

5. Investment in Agricultural Sector:
Addressing SDG 2 requires substantial financial commitments. The report highlights the need for increased investment in the agricultural sector, particularly in developing countries. It emphasizes promoting agricultural research and extension services, supporting farmers in accessing credit, and enhancing rural infrastructure and market linkages. Sustainable investment strategies and partnerships with the private sector are crucial to leverage resources effectively.

Comparative Analysis:

In a comparative analysis, the report highlights regional disparities and progress in achieving Zero Hunger.

1. Sub-Saharan Africa:
The report reveals that Sub-Saharan Africa remains the most food-insecure region globally, with high levels of undernourishment and persistent challenges in reducing poverty. Climate change, conflict, and inefficient agricultural practices pose severe obstacles to food security. The report emphasizes the urgent need for enhancing agricultural productivity, improving infrastructure, and promoting rural development in this region.

2. Asia:
Asia is home to the largest number of undernourished people globally. However, the region has made substantial progress in reducing hunger due to sustained economic growth and significant investments in agriculture. Despite this, challenges such as growing urbanization, expanding middle-class dietary patterns, and increasing non-communicable diseases demand continued efforts to address these underlying causes of malnutrition.

3. Latin America and the Caribbean:
The region has achieved significant improvements in addressing hunger and malnutrition, with the prevalence of undernourishment decreasing steadily. Although the challenges persist concerning income inequality, limited access to land for small farmers, and environmental degradation, policies promoting social inclusion and innovation in agriculture have shown positive outcomes that should be continued.

Conclusion:

The Eurasian Development Bank's report on SDG 2: Zero Hunger highlights the progress made while acknowledging the significant challenges that still lie ahead on our path to achieving food security. It emphasizes the need for greater investment in agricultural development, targeted interventions to address malnutrition, and sustainable agricultural practices. Additionally, addressing regional disparities and promoting international cooperation are key to global efforts in ensuring access to nutritious and sufficient food for all. The pursuit of Zero Hunger is a multifaceted task, requiring collective commitment, innovation, and unity to build a world in which no one suffers due to lack of food.
