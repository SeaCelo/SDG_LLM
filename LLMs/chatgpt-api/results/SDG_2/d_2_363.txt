Executive Summary 

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) presents this detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2): Zero Hunger. As a key player in supporting the development of sustainable agriculture and food security, the EBRD provides an expert analysis of the current progress and challenges facing SDG 2.

Introduction

SDG 2 aims to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. It addresses the alarming number of people suffering from hunger globally and the need for environmentally friendly food production systems. This report focuses on the current state of SDG 2, exploring notable achievements while highlighting crucial areas for improvement.

Overview of the Current Status

Despite having made considerable progress in recent years, significant challenges persist in achieving SDG 2 targets. The global population affected by hunger declined, yet approximately 811 million people still suffer from chronic undernourishment. Addressing hunger requires more than just providing individuals with sufficient calories; it needs to tackle the underlying causes such as poverty, access to resources, and nutrition gaps.

Country and Regional Analysis

Taking a closer look at individual countries and regions, the data reveals disparities in progress towards SDG 2. In Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, hunger and malnutrition rates remain high due to a combination of factors, including climate change impacts on agriculture, armed conflicts, and weak governance. This necessitates targeted efforts and localized solutions to address the unique challenges faced by different regions.

Agricultural Sustainability and Resilience

Ensuring sustainable and resilient agricultural practices is crucial to achieving SDG 2. Implementation of environmentally friendly approaches, such as agroforestry, conservation agriculture, and precision farming, aims to increase productivity while minimizing negative impacts on ecosystems. However, obstacles such as limited access to finance, knowledge, technology, and infrastructure hinder the widespread adoption of such practices.

Income Disparity and Value Chain Development

Addressing income disparities along the food value chain is vital for eradicating hunger. Small-scale farmers, particularly in developing countries, face immense challenges due to limited access to markets, credit, and knowledge. Creating sustainable value chains that support fair remuneration, inclusive business models, and smallholder integration can alleviate poverty, enhance yields, and bolster food security in these communities.

Global Trade and Agricultural Policies

Trade is an essential factor influencing global food security. Ensuring fair trade practices and reducing trade barriers can enhance access to markets for small-scale farmers and facilitate the availability of diverse and nutritious food. International Agricultural policies must be aligned with SDG 2 objectives to avoid adverse consequences, such as market distortions and dumping of agricultural surpluses in developing economies.

Gender Equality in Agriculture

Women play a pivotal role in agriculture, yet they often face gender-based discrimination, limited access to resources, and unequal participation in decision-making processes. Empowering women with equal opportunities and rights in agricultural activities through targeted programs and initiatives is essential to achieving SDG 2 targets.

Technology and Innovation

Leveraging technology and innovation can revolutionize agriculture and contribute to SDG 2. Advancements such as precision farming, remote sensing, and digital applications have the potential to increase agricultural productivity, monitor crop health, and improve resource management. Encouraging investment in research and development, digital infrastructure, and capacity building can foster innovation and support sustainable agricultural transformations.

Investment and Partnerships

Addressing the challenges of SDG 2 necessitates robust investment and partnerships. The role of international financial institutions, like the EBRD, is crucial in mobilizing resources, providing technical assistance, and facilitating transformative investments in agriculture. Public-private partnerships and cooperation between governments, civil society, and multilateral organizations are fundamental in leveraging expertise, sharing best practices, and driving collective action.

Conclusion

While tangible progress has been made towards achieving SDG 2, the scale and complexity of the challenges demand increased global effort and commitment. Through targeted interventions, policy coherence, innovative solutions, and strong partnerships, the world can ensure food security, promote sustainable agriculture, and ultimately eradicate hunger to achieve SDG 2 by 2030. The EBRD stands ready to continue its support in this endeavor, working towards a hunger-free and sustainable future for all.
