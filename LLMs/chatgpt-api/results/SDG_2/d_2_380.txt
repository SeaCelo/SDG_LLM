UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE ON TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT

ANALYTICAL REPORT: SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL 2

TARGETING AN EXPERT AUDIENCE

I. Introduction

In accordance with the mandate given by the United Nations General Assembly, this report aims to provide an analytical assessment of progress made towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2: Zero Hunger. This objective seeks to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture by the year 2030. As the custodian agency for SDG 2, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has closely followed global efforts and impacts related to this goal.

II. Overview of SDG 2

SDG 2 addresses critical challenges related to food security, malnutrition, agricultural sustainability, and rural development. With an estimated 690 million people facing hunger globally, achieving this goal is of paramount importance.

A. Objectives of SDG 2

1. End Hunger: The primary objective is to ensure that all individuals have access to sufficient and nutritious food year-round, which implies eliminating hunger in all its forms.

2. Achieve Food Security: SDG 2 aims to guarantee that all people, particularly the most vulnerable, have access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food to meet their dietary needs and preferences.

3. Improve Nutrition: The goal focuses on addressing malnutrition in all its forms, including stunting, wasting, and deficiencies in essential nutrients. Promoting balanced diets and applying sustainable agricultural practices are essential components.

4. Promote Sustainable Agriculture: SDG 2 emphasizes the implementation of sustainable agricultural practices, such as increasing productivity and income for small-scale farmers, ensuring resilient agricultural systems, and preserving genetic diversity.

B. Current Progress and Challenges

1. Zero Hunger Targets: Several sub-targets under SDG 2 are aimed at addressing specific areas of concern and assessing progress towards the overarching goal of zero hunger. Progress has been uneven across regions, underscoring the need for targeted interventions rooted in local contexts.

2. Climate Change and Agriculture: Climate change poses a significant challenge for agricultural systems worldwide due to the increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. Such events have adverse effects on food production, with small-scale farmers and vulnerable communities being most affected.

3. Food Loss and Waste: Despite progress in certain areas, a substantial amount of food is lost or wasted throughout the production and consumption processes, exacerbating issues of hunger, resource efficiency, and sustainability. Efforts to reduce food loss and waste must be intensified.

III. Policy Recommendations

To accelerate progress towards SDG 2 and ensure sustainable development, it is crucial to address the following key priority areas:

A. Enhancing Multilateral Cooperation: Stronger international cooperation is needed to facilitate knowledge sharing, technology transfer, and capacity building, particularly among developing countries.

B. Strengthening Resilience of Agricultural Systems: Supporting small-scale farmers through investment in infrastructure, access to finance, and technology adoption can enhance the resilience of agricultural systems and mitigate the impact of climate change.

C. Promoting Sustainable Food Systems: Efforts to promote sustainable food systems should prioritize the development of value chains, equitable access to markets, and inclusive policies that support small-scale farmers and local food producers.

D. Addressing Inequalities: Attention must be given to tackling inequalities that underpin hunger and malnutrition. Measures like social protection programs, gender equality, and equitable access to resources can contribute to more inclusive and resilient food systems.

IV. Conclusion

In conclusion, achieving SDG 2 necessitates an integrated approach that addresses the interconnected challenges of hunger, food security, nutrition, and agriculture. The report serves as a call to action, urging policymakers, stakeholders, and development practitioners to redouble their efforts in achieving a world free from hunger by 2030. By implementing the recommendations outlined in this report, the international community can lay the foundation for sustainable, inclusive, and resilient food systems, ensuring a better future for all.
