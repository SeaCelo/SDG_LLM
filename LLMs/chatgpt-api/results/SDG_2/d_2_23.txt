Introduction

This analytical report provides an in-depth analysis of Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) - "Zero Hunger", as it pertains to middle-income countries. As experts at the Economic Commission for Europe (ECE), our goal is to assess the current status, challenges, and potential strategies to achieve SDG 2 in these countries.

Overview of SDG 2 and Middle-Income Countries

SDG 2 aims to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030. Middle-income countries, characterized by their economic growth and diverse agricultural systems, play a critical role in achieving this goal. However, they face unique challenges such as population growth, urbanization, poverty, inequality, environmental degradation, and climate change impacts.

Current Status of SDG 2 in Middle-Income Countries

In middle-income countries, recent progress has been made in reducing hunger rates, improving agricultural productivity, and increasing household income and food consumption. However, substantial variations exist across and within countries. While some have achieved significant progress, others still struggle with food insecurity and malnutrition.

One major challenge these countries face is the dual burden of malnutrition, which encompasses both undernutrition and overweight/obesity. This challenge requires comprehensive strategies that address the quality, diversity, and accessibility of food while promoting healthy diets to combat both forms of malnutrition.

Challenges and Strategies for Achieving SDG 2 in Middle-Income Countries

A. Socioeconomic Factors

1. Poverty and Inequality: Despite economic growth, middle-income countries often struggle with high levels of poverty and income inequality. Addressing hunger requires targeted social protection measures, including cash transfers, school meals, and safety nets to reach vulnerable populations and improve their access to food.

2. Rural-Urban Divide: Urbanization and migration from rural to urban areas present challenges to achieving food security. Rapid urbanization increases demand for food, impacting prices and availability. Strategies should focus on improving agricultural productivity in rural areas while ensuring urban populations have access to nutritious food through strengthened supply chains and urban farming initiatives.

B. Productive Agriculture and Sustainable Resource Management

1. Agricultural Productivity: Enhancing agricultural productivity is vital for achieving food security, poverty reduction, and rural development. Smallholder farmers, who represent the majority of food producers in middle-income countries, need support in terms of access to land, finance, inputs, technology, and knowledge through targeted agricultural extension services.

2. Sustainable Resource Management: Middle-income countries must balance the need for increased food production with sustainable natural resource management. Sustainable farming practices, efficient water management, agroecology promotion, and climate-smart approaches are needed to mitigate the negative environmental impact of agriculture.

C. Resilience to Climate Change and Natural Disasters

Middle-income countries are vulnerable to climate change impacts and frequent natural disasters that pose a threat to food security and agricultural production. Adaptation strategies that enhance the resilience of agricultural systems, such as climate-smart technologies, early warning systems, and crop diversification, are crucial to build the resilience of farmers and ensure sustainable food production in the face of climatic uncertainties.

Conclusion

In conclusion, for middle-income countries to achieve SDG 2, comprehensive and tailored approaches are necessary, taking into account specific socio-economic, agricultural, and environmental contexts. Addressing the dual burden of malnutrition, tackling poverty, closing the urban-rural divide, improving agricultural productivity, and building resilience to climate change are key areas for action. Collaborative efforts involving governments, civil society, international organizations, and the private sector are essential to drive transformative change towards a world with zero hunger. As experts, it is crucial for us to support and guide middle-income countries in their journey towards achieving SDG 2.
