The Sustainable Development Goal 16 (SDG 16) aims to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all, and build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels. This expert report presents a thorough analysis of the current progress and challenges faced in implementing SDG 16 in the region of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).

With regards to the promotion of peaceful and inclusive societies, the CIS region has made significant strides in recent years. For instance, many countries have strengthened legislation to protect human rights, implemented initiatives to prevent violence and conflict, and enhanced public participation in decision-making processes. However, challenges persist in several areas.

Firstly, achieving access to justice for all remains a crucial challenge in the region. While many legal frameworks are in place, accessibility to justice is limited due to various factors such as geographical barriers, barriers related to language and culture, and high costs associated with legal procedures. Enabling equal and affordable access to justice requires concerted efforts to improve legal aid systems, strengthen the capacity of justice institutions, and enhance coordination and collaboration between relevant stakeholders.

Additionally, an essential aspect of SDG 16 is the establishment of effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels. In this regard, despite progress made in reforming governance systems in the CIS region, there are persistent challenges related to corruption, weak rule of law, and limited transparency. Strengthening institutional capacity, promoting integrity and accountability, and creating mechanisms for citizen participation will be crucial in addressing these challenges.

The region also faces unique challenges related to creating an informed society equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to actively participate in decision-making processes. Promoting access to information, facilitating civic education, and utilizing advanced communication technologies can play a significant role in narrowing the information gap and fostering a culture of transparency, accountability, and public dialogue.

Moreover, tackling violence and reducing conflict is crucial for promoting peaceful societies in the CIS region. While some countries have made notable progress in preventing and addressing violence and crime, challenges still exist concerning domestic violence, child abuse, and organized crime. Strengthening legal frameworks, enhancing the enforcement of laws, and promoting prevention strategies in collaboration with civil society organizations will be critical in overcoming these challenges.

Furthermore, the establishment of effective mechanisms for data collection, monitoring, and reporting is essential for tracking progress towards SDG 16 in the CIS region. While significant efforts have been made to improve data availability, there are still gaps in terms of data disaggregation and harmonization between countries. Investing in data infrastructure, promoting intergovernmental cooperation, and utilizing innovative data collection methods can significantly contribute to ensuring accurate and compatible data for evidence-based policymaking.

In conclusion, the current report emphasizes the progress made and the challenges faced in implementing SDG 16 in the CIS region. It highlights the importance of establishing peaceful and inclusive societies through access to justice, accountable institutions, and preventing conflict and violence. Furthermore, creating an informed society and strengthening data collection mechanisms are paramount to supporting the achievement of SDG 16 in the CIS region. It is crucial for policymakers, government officials, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders to work collaboratively towards addressing the identified challenges and advancing the objectives outlined in SDG 16 for a sustainable and peaceful future in the region.
