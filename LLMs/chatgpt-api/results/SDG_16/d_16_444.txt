The Current State of SDG 16: Analysing the Progress and Challenges

1. Introduction

This analytical report aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of the current status of Sustainable Development Goal 16 (SDG 16), which focuses on promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, providing access to justice for all, and building effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels.

2. Background of SDG 16

SDG 16 recognizes the direct link between peace, justice, and sustainable development. It acknowledges that without peaceful societies, it is challenging to achieve other goals set under the 2030 Agenda. Prioritizing peace and justice helps establish an enabling environment for socio-economic development, ensures the protection of human rights, and guarantees equitable access to resources and opportunities for all.
