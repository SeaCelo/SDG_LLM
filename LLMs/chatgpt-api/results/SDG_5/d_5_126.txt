1. Introduction
Gender inequality poses a significant challenge to global development, affecting individuals, communities, and societies. Recognizing the urgency of addressing this issue, the United Nations formulated a specific goal to achieve gender equality – SDG 5. This article aims to comprehensively examine SDG 5, exploring its significance, challenges, and strategies facilitating the achievement of gender equality on a global scale.

3. Interlinkages with Other SDGs
The SDGs interconnect with each other, collectively building paths towards sustainable development. SDG 5 overlaps with various other goals including poverty eradication (SDG 1), quality education (SDG 4), decent work and economic growth (SDG 8), and peaceful and inclusive societies (SDG 16). This section elaborates on these interlinkages, stressing the integrated approach required for comprehensive progress.

4. Policy Frameworks and Supportive Initiatives

Highlighting national and international efforts, this section examines initiatives like the Gender-responsive Budgeting (GRB), HeForShe campaign, Women Empowerment Principles (WEPs), and the UN Women-led Generation Equality initiative, underscoring the importance of collaboration, advocacy, and institutional reform.

5. Gender Equality and Sustainable Development in Developing Countries
Developing countries face unique challenges in achieving gender equality and sustainable development.
