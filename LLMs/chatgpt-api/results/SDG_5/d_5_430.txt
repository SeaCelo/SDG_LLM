Executive Summary

This report provides a detailed analysis of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5: Gender Equality, from the perspective of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). Targeting an expert audience, it aims to scrutinize the current status of this goal, identify critical challenges, propose practical solutions, and highlight the role MSF plays in achieving gender equality globally. The report discusses the impact of gender inequality on health, its intertwined relationship with armed conflicts, crisis settings, and the COVID-19 pandemic, and provides recommendations to accelerate progress towards SDG 5.

1. Introduction

SDG 5 focuses on achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls. MSF, with its extensive experience in delivering healthcare in challenging environments, understands the intricate link between gender equality and health outcomes.

2. Current Status

Despite some progress, widespread gender disparities continue to plague societies, hindering the achievement of SDG 5. Structural barriers, discriminatory norms, gender-based violence, and limited access to education and healthcare perpetuate gender inequality.

3. Impact of Gender Inequality on Health

Deep-rooted gender disparities have a profound impact on health outcomes, particularly for women and girls. Gender-based violence, including sexual violence as a weapon of war, affects physical and mental well-being. Lack of access to sexual and reproductive healthcare services, including contraception and safe abortions, subject women to high mortality risks and unintended pregnancies.

4. Armed Conflicts and Crisis Settings

Armed conflicts and crisis settings exacerbate gender inequalities and present distinct challenges. Women and girls living in regions affected by conflict are vulnerable to sexual violence, early and forced marriages, and limited access to healthcare. Lack of engagement in conflict resolution and peacebuilding processes deprives them of decision-making power and slows progress towards gender equality.

5. COVID-19 Pandemic

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted women and girls, worsening gender inequalities. Lockdowns and mobility restrictions have increased instances of domestic violence, while disruptions to healthcare services have reduced access to sexual and reproductive healthcare. Furthermore, women constitute the majority of frontline workers, exposing them to increased health risks.

6. MSF's Approach to Gender Equality

MSF firmly believes in gender equality as a prerequisite for achieving health and well-being for all. Through its projects worldwide, MSF strives to address gender-specific healthcare needs, combat gender-based violence, and promote women's empowerment. Strengthening healthcare systems to be gender-responsive, enhancing women's leadership, and engaging with local communities are key aspects of MSF's approach.

7. Recommendations

To accelerate progress towards SDG 5, MSF proposes the following recommendations:

a) Strengthening healthcare systems with a focus on reducing gender disparities in access to healthcare, including sexual and reproductive health services.
b) Scaling up efforts to prevent and respond to gender-based violence in conflict-affected and crisis settings.
c) Empowering women and girls by promoting educational opportunities, economic empowerment, and meaningful participation in decision-making processes.
d) Integrating a gender lens in emergency responses, recognizing the different needs and vulnerabilities of women and girls, and ensuring their voices are heard.
e) Collaboration among governments, civil society organizations, and the international community to promote gender equality and ensure access to justice for survivors of gender-based violence.

8. Conclusion

Addressing gender inequalities is essential for achieving SDG 5 and improving health outcomes for women and girls. By adopting a holistic approach, accelerating actions, and prioritizing the needs of vulnerable populations, progress can be made towards a more equitable and inclusive society where individuals can achieve their full potential regardless of gender.

MSF remains committed to working alongside partners and stakeholders to advance gender equality and improve health outcomes, ending preventable suffering and deaths worldwide.
