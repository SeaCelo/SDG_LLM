1. Introduction
Sustainable Development Goal 5 (SDG 5) recognizes the fundamental importance of achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls. The goal acknowledges that gender equality is not only a basic human right but also a necessary condition for sustainable development. By addressing key gender-related challenges and ensuring women's participation and leadership, SDG 5 paves the way for inclusive economic growth and transforms societies worldwide. This article explores the multifaceted nature of SDG 5 and its implications for economic development.

2. Gender-Based Discrimination and Access to Education and Healthcare
SDG 5 calls for the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women and girls, both in legal frameworks and societal practices. Gender inequalities have far-reaching consequences, restricting women's access to education, healthcare, and employment opportunities. This section illustrates the detrimental effects of gender-based discrimination and emphasizes the importance of creating a supportive environment that promotes equal access to education and healthcare services, ultimately fostering human capital development and economic progress.

3. Economic Empowerment of Women
SDG 5 recognizes that gender equality cannot be achieved without empowering women economically. This section emphasizes the need for policies and programs that enhance women's access to financial resources, credit, and entrepreneurship opportunities. Evidence suggests that when women are economically empowered, it leads to increased productivity, poverty reduction, and inclusive economic growth. Furthermore, the article sheds light on some impediments to women's economic empowerment, such as gender wage gaps and limited representation in leadership positions.

4. Ending Gender-Based Violence
SDG 5's explicit goal of ending violence against women and girls is critical for achieving gender equality. This section explores the prevalence and various forms of gender-based violence, including domestic violence, female genital mutilation, and human trafficking. Furthermore, it discusses the detrimental consequences of such violence on physical and psychological well-being, economic productivity, and social cohesion. Approaches to prevent and address gender-based violence involve comprehensive legal frameworks, awareness campaigns, and support services for survivors.

5. Economic Benefits of Gender Equality
Gender equality is not only a moral imperative but also an economic opportunity. This section highlights the potential economic benefits that can be achieved by attaining SDG 5 targets. Emerging research provides evidence that gender equality positively impacts economies by stimulating productivity, boosting labor force participation, attracting investments, and reducing income inequality. Closing gender gaps in education and employment can significantly contribute to macroeconomic stability, poverty eradication, and sustainable development.

6. Policy Interventions and Recommendations
This section focuses on policy interventions and recommendations aimed at achieving SDG 5. The article highlights the importance of country-specific strategies that address the unique challenges and contexts of each nation, emphasizing collaborative efforts by governments, civil society, and the private sector. Key recommendations include advancing legal frameworks, promoting gender-sensitive education and healthcare systems, integrating gender equality objectives into economic policies and business practices, strengthening data collection and analysis, and providing targeted financial and technical assistance.

7. Conclusion
This article concludes by emphasizing that SDG 5's achievement is a shared responsibility and requires coordinated action from various stakeholders. Through addressing gender-based discrimination, ensuring access to education and healthcare, empowering women economically, and ending gender-based violence, SDG 5 lays the foundations for a more inclusive and prosperous future. The economic gains obtained through gender equality are not only a means for growth but also a reflection of societies' commitment to human rights, dignity, and sustainable development. By prioritizing SDG 5, the global community can drive positive change and create equitable and just societies.
