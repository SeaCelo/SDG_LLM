Sarah Holland-Batt is an esteemed poet, scholar, and academic with a deep understanding of literature and social justice issues. As such, it is interesting to imagine what a long academic article about Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5, "Gender Equality," written by Holland-Batt would look like.

In this article, Holland-Batt would begin by highlighting the importance of SDG 5 in the broader context of the Sustainable Development Goals. She would emphasize that achieving gender equality is not merely a matter of social justice but also essential for global progress and development. Moreover, she would argue that gender equality is a fundamental human right and a prerequisite for achieving all the other SDGs. No society can achieve its full potential if half of its population is denied the opportunity to thrive and contribute fully.

Moving beyond this introductory context setting, Holland-Batt would delve into an exploration of the root causes of gender inequality and the systemic barriers that perpetuate it. Drawing on her expertise in feminist theory and her understanding of literature, she would skillfully weave together various theoretical frameworks to present a nuanced analysis of patriarchal power structures, gender norms, and intersectionality. She would highlight how these factors interact to create and perpetuate inequality.

Throughout her article, Holland-Batt would present a meticulously researched and engagingly written analysis of the various components of SDG 5. She would articulate the specific targets outlined by the United Nations, focusing on the need to end all forms of discrimination against women and girls. She would discuss the importance of eliminating violence and harmful practices, promoting women's participation in decision-making processes, ensuring equal access to quality education, and bridging the gender pay gap.

Moreover, Holland-Batt would emphasize the need for sustained and comprehensive efforts to implement SDG 5. Drawing on examples from across the globe, she would demonstrate the effectiveness of different approaches to achieving gender equality, including legislative reforms, grassroots activism, and economic empowerment initiatives. She would also highlight the necessity of genuine partnership between governments, civil society organizations, and the private sector to ensure progress at both the local and global levels.

In her article, Holland-Batt would not shy away from addressing the challenges and complexities associated with SDG 5. She would critically examine the limitations of existing strategies and policies and propose innovative solutions based on her own research. She might argue for the incorporation of arts and literature as tools for social change, emphasizing the transformative potential of storytelling in challenging gender inequality. She would call for continued attention to the unique challenges faced by marginalized groups such as indigenous women, LGBTQ+ individuals, and women with disabilities, highlighting the significance of an intersectional approach.

Finally, Holland-Batt would conclude her article by reiterating the urgency of achieving gender equality and emphasizing that it requires concerted and sustained efforts from all stakeholders. She would stress the importance of political will, resource allocation, and data-driven monitoring and evaluation. She would encourage further interdisciplinary research and collaboration among scholars, policymakers, and activists to continually examine and recalibrate strategies for achieving SDG 5. 

In summary, an academic article on SDG 5 written by Sarah Holland-Batt would be an illuminating exploration of the roots, consequences, and potential solutions to gender inequality. It would offer a thought-provoking synthesis of feminist theory, literature, and policy analysis, inspiring readers to engage with the multifaceted dimensions of this essential Sustainable Development Goal.
