Abstract:
The 2030 Agenda adopted by the United Nations encompasses a set of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to address the social, economic, and environmental challenges faced by humanity. SDG 12 outlines the goal of ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns, thereby promoting resource efficiency, minimizing waste generation, and contributing to the overall sustainable development of society. This article aims to explore the targets and indicators of SDG 12, assess the progress made towards its realization, and highlight the role of accounting and economics in advancing this important global agenda.

1. Introduction:
Sustainable consumption and production lie at the heart of achieving sustainable development. SDG 12 seeks to promote responsible consumption and production patterns among individuals, governments, and corporations to minimize the detrimental impact on the environment and human well-being. It recognizes the need to address issues related to waste management, resource utilization, and firms' social and environmental disclosures. Integrating accounting and economics into the pursuit of SDG 12 is crucial to developing effective strategies, monitoring progress, and understanding the economic implications of sustainable consumption and production.

2. Targets and Indicators:
SDG 12 comprises a set of targets and indicators that provide measurable goals and guide monitoring efforts. The targets include promoting sustainable public procurement practices, achieving the environmentally sound management of chemicals and waste, reducing food loss and waste, and ensuring productive employment and decent work opportunities. Indicators such as material footprint, carbon footprint, waste generation per capita, food loss index, labor productivity, and the share of sustainable products in government procurement offer a quantitative framework for assessing progress towards these targets.

3. Progress Made:
While progress towards SDG 12 is ongoing, several challenges exist. Despite efforts to increase energy efficiency and promote recycling, consumption levels worldwide continue to rise, exerting pressure on natural resources and ecosystems. Inadequate waste management systems in developing countries contribute to environmental pollution and health hazards. Food loss and waste at different stages of the supply chain remain a persistent problem, wasting resources and exacerbating hunger and food insecurity. Moreover, the role of accounting has been limited in capturing the true costs and benefits of sustainable production practices, hindering the adoption of effective strategies.

4. The Role of Accounting and Economics:
Accounting and economics play a crucial role in promoting sustainable consumption and production under SDG 12. By providing a clear understanding of costs and benefits, accounting enables firms to evaluate the financial implications of adopting sustainable practices. It also facilitates the measurement, disclosure, and verification of environmental and social impacts, such as carbon emissions, water consumption, and supply chain conditions. Environmental accounting techniques, such as life cycle assessment and carbon accounting, allow for the identification and implementation of strategies to reduce resource consumption and minimize waste. Incorporating such practices into firms' decision-making processes enhances their overall sustainability.

Economics provides valuable insights into the drivers of consumption and production patterns. The adoption of regulatory mechanisms, such as eco-labelling, taxes, and subsidies, can influence consumer behavior and incentivize sustainable choices. Economic models help assess the costs and benefits associated with environmental policies, promoting the integration of sustainability into business operations and supply chains. Economists also contribute to the understanding of consumer preferences, evaluating the potential impact of behavioral interventions and alternative consumption patterns on achieving SDG 12.

5. Challenges and Recommendations:
Despite the importance of accounting and economics in achieving SDG 12, several challenges must be addressed. These include the lack of standardized reporting frameworks, difficulties in valuing and integrating non-financial information into decision-making processes, and limited awareness and understanding of sustainable practices among businesses and consumers. Innovative solutions, such as the development of integrated reporting frameworks, sustainability education and training programs, and improved access to sustainability-related information, can help overcome these challenges.

Collaboration is essential to effectively implement and achieve SDG 12. Partnership between governments, the private sector, civil society organizations, and academia can foster knowledge sharing, capacity building, and the adoption of best practices. Moreover, international cooperation is crucial in coordinating efforts, sharing experiences, and enabling technology transfers to support sustainable consumption and production globally.

6. Conclusion:
SDG 12 marks a vital step towards achieving sustainable consumption and production patterns worldwide. Accounting and economics have a significant role to play in shaping and realizing this goal. Improved accounting practices and robust economic models can provide the necessary information and incentives to encourage responsible consumption and production behaviors. Overcoming challenges through collaboration and innovative solutions will be essential in facilitating the transition towards a more sustainable future for all.
