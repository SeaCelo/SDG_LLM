Introduction:

The Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency (TCCA) is pleased to present this detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 12 (SDG 12) - Responsible Consumption and Production. This report aims to provide expert insights and analysis on the current status of SDG 12 implementation, with a focus on Turkey. SDG 12 seeks to promote sustainable consumption and production patterns by ensuring the efficient use of resources and reducing waste and pollution.

Overview of SDG 12:

SDG 12 is rooted in the understanding that the traditional patterns of consumption and production have become unsustainable and threaten the planet's finite resources. This goal targets changes in individual behavior and corporate practices to ensure a more sustainable future. The targets under SDG 12 can be categorized into four interrelated pillars: reducing waste generation, achieving sustainable lifestyles, promoting sustainable public procurement, and ensuring environmentally sound management of chemicals and waste.

Current Status of SDG 12 in Turkey:

1. Reducing Waste Generation:
Turkish government has made significant efforts to reduce waste generation, particularly through the establishment and enforcement of waste management regulations. However, challenges remain, as waste generation continues to increase due to population growth and economic development. To address this, Turkey has implemented various policies such as incentivizing recycling, enforcing extended producer responsibility, and promoting circular economy principles.

2. Achieving Sustainable Lifestyles:
The promotion of sustainable lifestyles requires changing consumption and production patterns through awareness-raising campaigns and education. Turkey has undertaken several initiatives to raise awareness about the need for sustainable consumption, especially in urban areas. These initiatives have focused on sustainable food consumption, energy-efficient housing, and sustainable transportation options. However, further efforts are needed to mainstream sustainable lifestyles across the country.

3. Promoting Sustainable Public Procurement:
Public procurement plays a crucial role in driving sustainable production practices. To this end, Turkey has adopted a sustainable public procurement policy, which requires government entities to consider environmental and social factors when procuring goods and services. However, the implementation of this policy is still relatively limited, and there is a need for stronger coordination and capacity-building to ensure its effective implementation.

4. Ensuring Environmentally Sound Management of Chemicals and Waste:
Chemicals and waste management pose significant challenges to sustainable development. Turkey has implemented comprehensive legislation to regulate the production, use, and disposal of hazardous chemicals. Efforts have been made to strengthen the institutional framework for chemical management and enhance capacity-building for chemical safety. However, more resources and efforts are needed to ensure the proper management and disposal of hazardous chemicals and waste.

Challenges and Opportunities:

While Turkey has made commendable progress in advancing SDG 12, several challenges persist. These challenges include limited funding and resources, lack of awareness and understanding towards sustainable consumption and production, and the need for stronger policy coherence and coordination among relevant stakeholders.

However, amidst these challenges, there are significant opportunities that can be leveraged. Turkey's strategic geographical location, diverse economy, and strong institutional capacity provide a solid foundation for accelerating progress towards SDG 12. Synergies and collaboration with existing initiatives, such as the Turkish National Climate Action Plan and Sustainable Cities Program, can be harnessed to drive sustainable consumption and production.

Recommendations:

In light of the challenges and opportunities, the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency proposes the following recommendations to accelerate SDG 12 implementation in Turkey:

1. Strengthen awareness-raising campaigns and education programs targeting different segments of society to promote sustainable lifestyles and behavioral change.

2. Enhance the capacity of relevant institutions and stakeholders to implement sustainable public procurement practices effectively. This can be achieved through training programs, technical assistance, and knowledge sharing.

3. Mobilize additional funding and resources, both domestically and through international partnerships, to support initiatives that advance sustainable consumption and production practices.

4. Foster multi-stakeholder partnerships and platforms for collaboration, including the private sector, civil society organizations, and academia, to enhance synergies and facilitate knowledge exchange.

Conclusion:

The progress towards achieving SDG 12 in Turkey has been promising, but there is a need for continued commitment and action to address the remaining challenges. By implementing the recommended strategies, Turkey can realize its vision of sustainable consumption and production, contributing to a more equitable and environmentally friendly future. The Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency stands ready to support Turkey's efforts in fulfilling its commitments under SDG 12 and encourages domestic and international actors to join forces towards sustainable development.
