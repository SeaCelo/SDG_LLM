Introduction:

The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 17 is an integral part of the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It focuses on revitalizing global partnerships for sustainable development. This report, prepared by the Center for Victims of Torture (CVT), aims to provide a detailed analysis of SDG 17, with a particular focus on how it can contribute to achieving sustainable development goals and promoting the well-being of torture victims.

Context:

Recognizing that no single country or entity can independently address the complex challenges of sustainable development, SDG 17 underscores the importance of collaborative and inclusive partnerships. It emphasizes the need for the sustained mobilization and diversification of resources, technology sharing, and capacity-building to enable progress across all the SDGs.

Analysis:

1. Partnerships for Sustainable Development:
SDG 17 acknowledges the importance of North-South, South-South, and triangular partnerships in catalyzing economic growth and sustainable development. For the Center for Victims of Torture, this means developing strategic collaborations with governments, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders to enhance victims' rehabilitation and promote recovery programs.

2. Finance and Trade:
The SDG agenda acknowledges the critical role of trade in achieving sustainable development. It promotes a universal, rules-based, open, and non-discriminatory multilateral trading system. In this regard, the Center for Victims of Torture recognizes the significance of fair trade practices in protecting vulnerable populations, including torture victims, from exploitation while promoting inclusive economic growth.

3. Technology Facilitation Mechanisms:
Technological advancements have the potential to drive sustainable development, boost productivity, and address existing challenges. SDG 17 highlights the need for technology transfer and diffusion, as well as promoting research and development partnerships. The Center for Victims of Torture identifies advancements in artificial intelligence, trauma-informed technologies, and telehealth services as avenues through which torture survivors can gain easier access to specialized care and support.

4. Capacity-building:
One of the pillars of SDG 17 is capacity-building, which encourages the transfer of skills, knowledge, and technology to developing countries and marginalized communities. The Center for Victims of Torture, being a global leader in the field of torture rehabilitation, recognizes the importance of sharing expertise and training professionals in low-resource settings. It strives to enhance the capacity and resilience of healthcare providers, policymakers, and civil society organizations in order to better serve torture victims and promote sustainable development.

5. Data, Monitoring, and Accountability:
SDG 17 emphasizes the need for reliable and timely data collection, monitoring mechanisms, and accountability systems at all levels. The Center for Victims of Torture aligns with this objective by advocating for comprehensive data-gathering processes on torture incidents and survivors' needs. Building a robust database can help inform evidence-based policies and allocate resources more effectively to address the long-term rehabilitation and reintegration challenges faced by torture victims.

Outcomes and Recommendations:

SDG 17 provides the necessary framework to build and sustain fruitful partnerships that further the ambitions of all other SDGs and improve the well-being of torture victims. Recognizing the interdependency among the goals, the Center for Victims of Torture offers the following recommendations:

1. Foster Collaboration: Governments, local communities, NGOs, and international bodies need to leverage their respective strengths, working collaboratively to foster sustainable development, promote rehabilitation approaches, and advocate for effective policies.

2. Encourage Investment: Continued investments in rehabilitation services, training programs, and research initiatives can help ensure that torture victims receive appropriate and comprehensive support.

3. Support Knowledge Exchange: International bodies should facilitate the sharing of expertise, best practices, and technology transfer to ensure that innovative solutions reach those who need them most.

4. Strengthen Data Collection: Governments and civil society organizations should strengthen data collection mechanisms related to torture incidents and the needs of survivors to inform evidence-based interventions, policy development, and resource allocation.

5. Cultivate Partnerships: Stakeholders need to actively seek out and cultivate partnerships, particularly in the areas of healthcare, technology, and human rights advocacy, to ensure that torture victims are not forgotten in global development efforts.

Conclusion:

The achievement of SDG 17 is crucial for achieving the broader sustainable development goals. The Center for Victims of Torture understands the significance of collaboration, capacity-building, and data-driven strategies in supporting torture survivors. By adopting the recommendations outlined above, all stakeholders can contribute to sustainable and inclusive development, facilitating the recovery of victims of torture, and upholding their rights. Only through these joint efforts can we build a future where no one is left behind.
