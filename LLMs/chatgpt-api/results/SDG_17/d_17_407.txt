Analytical Report on Sustainable Development Goal 17
Target Audience: Experts in Sustainable Development

Introduction:
Sustainable Development Goal 17 (SDG 17) emphasizes the importance of strengthening global partnerships for sustainable development. This report will critically analyze and delve deeply into the state of SDG 17 with regards to its objectives, progress, challenges, and future opportunities. By focusing on the various targets and indicators within SDG 17, this report aims to provide an insightful analysis of the current landscape of global partnerships for sustainable development.

Objective 1: Strengthening domestic resource mobilization:
One of the key targets of SDG 17 focuses on enhancing developing countries' capacities to mobilize domestic resources for sustainable development. While progress has been made, significant challenges persist. In many developing countries, tax evasion, illicit financial flows, and weak governance systems undermine the effective mobilization of resources. Moreover, the disparity between developed and developing nations in terms of tax reforms, technology transfer, and capacity-building limit the success of domestic resource mobilization. A comprehensive analysis is essential to identify pragmatic solutions to bridge these gaps and enhance partnerships aimed at achieving this target.

Objective 2: Enhancing international cooperation:
The second objective of SDG 17 emphasizes the need to promote international cooperation to support developing countries' efforts in achieving sustainable development. This objective encompasses international trade, technology transfer, and financing mechanisms. Although some progress has taken place, challenges still persist. Major economies implementing protectionist policies hinder fair trade practices and impede effective partnerships for sustainable development. Additionally, the digital divide prevents countries from accessing and utilizing cutting-edge technologies, hampering progress towards sustainable development. This report will examine concrete measures to bolster international cooperation and tackle the aforementioned challenges.

Objective 3: Fostering coherence and policy integration:
SDG 17 calls for greater coherence and policy integration to achieve sustainable development effectively. A lack of coordination between different ministries and institutions at the national level, as well as fragmented policies at the global level, undermine the ability to address complex interconnected challenges. Policy silos restrict the consideration of social, economic, and environmental objectives within decision-making processes. Highlighting successful case studies and lessons learned, this analysis aims to propose ways to foster coherence between various sectors and levels of governance for enhanced policy integration.

Objective 4: Monitoring and accountability:
Successful implementation and achievement of the SDGs require robust monitoring mechanisms and enhanced accountability frameworks. Currently, gaps exist in data availability, capacity, and reliability, hindering the effective tracking of progress. Furthermore, despite the voluntary and non-binding nature of the SDGs, accountability mechanisms remain weak, without clear reporting obligations or consequences for non-compliance. This report will critically assess such challenges and propose innovative ways to strengthen monitoring and accountability frameworks at the national and global level, facilitating transparency and promoting greater cooperation.

Future Opportunities:
In addition to the challenges outlined, SDG 17 also presents various opportunities for future advancements in global partnerships. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the necessity for increased cooperation and solidarity in addressing global challenges. By leveraging lessons learned from this crisis, transformative partnerships can be forged to accelerate progress in all SDGs. Embracing digital technologies and fostering innovation in data collection, analysis, and reporting can drive the realization of SDG 17.

Conclusion:
SDG 17 plays a crucial role in facilitating the achievement of all sustainable development goals. However, certain challenges hinder progress, such as disparities between developed and developing nations, weak policy coherence, and inadequate monitoring and accountability mechanisms. Christian Aid recognizes the urgency and importance of overcoming these challenges. This report has provided an in-depth analysis of SDG 17, highlighting its objectives, progress made, challenges faced, and future opportunities. By taking concrete steps to strengthen domestic resource mobilization, enhance international cooperation, foster policy coherence, and improve monitoring and accountability, transformative partnerships can be forged, ultimately leading us closer to achieving sustainable development for all.
