Introduction:

This analytical report aims to dissect the current status of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11 from the perspective of the Afghan German Management College (AGMC). SDG 11 focuses on making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. As an expert academic institution, AGMC recognizes the significance of this goal for fostering urban development in Afghanistan. This report will provide an in-depth analysis of the achievements, challenges, and recommendations related to SDG 11 in the Afghan context.

1. Background and Context:

Afghanistan is undergoing rapid urbanization, with an estimated 25% of its population residing in urban areas. However, this growth has put immense pressure on existing infrastructure, public services, and social cohesion. Cities and human settlements in Afghanistan are struggling to provide necessary amenities to their residents, and notable issues such as inadequate housing, limited access to clean water and sanitation, poor waste management systems, and traffic congestion have arisen.

2. Achievements:

Despite the challenges, Afghanistan has witnessed commendable progress in addressing SDG 11 targets. Efforts have been made to bolster inclusive urban planning and management through initiatives such as the National Urban Development Policy and Provincial Development Plans. The prioritization of urban resilience has been reflected in the establishment of the Afghanistan Resilient Cities Program. Moreover, the renovation of historic sites and cultural heritage has been undertaken to promote sustainable tourism and preserve national heritage.

3. Challenges:

Numerous challenges hinder the attainment of SDG 11 in Afghanistan. Firstly, the high population growth rate further strains urban areas, leading to inadequate housing supply. Additionally, limited coordination among different levels of government impedes effective urban planning and management, resulting in disorganized settlements and unplanned urban sprawl. Insufficient financial resources, both domestically and externally, delay the implementation of infrastructure projects and limit investment in sustainable urban development. Furthermore, a lack of technical expertise and capacity within local authorities constrains their ability to implement sustainable initiatives effectively.

4. Recommendations:

To address these challenges, the Afghan German Management College proposes the following recommendations for the achievement of SDG 11:

a) Enhance Policy Implementation: The Afghan government should prioritize the implementation of existing policies through improved coordination and collaboration among relevant stakeholders. This can be achieved by strengthening the capacities of local authorities and establishing clear monitoring and evaluation mechanisms.

b) Invest in Sustainable Infrastructure: Efforts should be made to attract private and foreign investment for developing sustainable infrastructure such as affordable housing, water and sanitation systems, and public transportation. Creating incentives for private sector participation can mobilize additional resources to support the achievement of SDG 11 targets.

c) Promote Community Engagement: Engaging local communities in decision-making processes and encouraging their participation in urban planning initiatives can enable the development of inclusive and sustainable cities. These efforts should be coupled with awareness campaigns to educate citizens on the importance of sustainable practices.

d) Build Technical Capacity: Capacity building programs should be formulated and delivered to equip local authorities and professionals with the necessary technical skills to implement sustainable urban development practices. This can be achieved through partnerships with academic institutions, knowledge exchange programs, and specialized training workshops.

Conclusion:

In closing, the Afghan German Management College recognizes that achieving SDG 11 in Afghanistan requires concerted efforts and effective collaboration among various stakeholders. Progress has been made, but challenges persist. By implementing the aforementioned recommendations and investing in infrastructure and human capacity, Afghanistan can make significant strides towards creating inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities and human settlements, ultimately improving the lives of its urban population.
