Urban areas are experiencing unprecedented growth and transforming at an unprecedented pace. By 2050, it is projected that over two-thirds of the global population will be residing in cities. This rapid urbanization presents both opportunities and challenges that warrant careful analysis and action, which neatly aligns with Sustainable Development Goal 11 - making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.

Achieving SDG 11 calls for concerted efforts towards enhancing the quality of urban life, ensuring equitable access to basic services, and creating sustainable and resilient cities and communities. This analytical report aims to explore the current state of SDG 11, highlighting key challenges and outlining potential pathways towards fulfillment. Targeted towards an expert audience, this report focuses on an in-depth analysis of SDG 11's specific targets and related indicators.

Target 11.1 focuses on ensuring access for all to adequate, safe, and affordable housing, and basic services. This is a fundamental pillar of sustainable urban development. To measure progress, indicators track the proportion of urban population living in slums, the proportion of households living in inadequate housing, and the proportion of urban population lacking access to basic services such as water, sanitation, solid waste management, and transport. While strides have been made, evident by decreasing proportions of slum dwellers, challenges persist. Rapid urbanization outpaces the provision of necessary services, leaving many urban residents with inadequate housing conditions and limited access to basic services.

Building on the previous target, target 11.3 delves deeper into the issue of inclusive and sustainable urbanization, focusing on access to safe, inclusive, and accessible green and public spaces. These spaces foster community cohesion, well-being, and provide room for recreational activities. Indicators for this target examine the proportion of land area per capita dedicated to public open space, parks, and gardens, as well as the proportion of the population within a specific distance from a green or public space. Currently, urban environments often lack sufficient public spaces due to limited planning, land availability, and resource constraints. Accessibility and safety, particularly for marginalized populations, further compound the challenge of realizing this target.

Target 11.6 emphasizes reducing the impact of cities on the environment and improving urban resilience. This objective underlines the urgency of mitigating and adapting to climate change, ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns, and bolstering disaster risk reduction. Indicators assess urban air quality, waste management, the proportion of urban solid waste regularly collected and safely disposed, and the proportion of the population living in cities with access to reliable and sustainable transportation. Urban areas often face pollution, waste management challenges, inadequate infrastructure, and transportation congestion, placing strain on livability and environmental sustainability.

Another critical target is 11.b, which seeks to substantially increase the number of cities and human settlements adopting and implementing integrated policies and plans towards inclusion, resource efficiency, adaptation to climate change, and resilience. Indicators primarily focus on the existence of integrated urban policies and plans that address the aforementioned domains of sustainability. While notable efforts have been made in this regard, adoption and implementation of integrated policies remain uneven across urban areas. Limited resources, institutional capacities, and coordination mechanisms pose significant roadblocks towards achieving this target universally.

To complement these specific targets, cross-cutting issues of importance within SDG 11 include gender equality, youth engagement, and participatory urban planning approaches. Women often face disproportionate burdens in urban environments, including limited access to economic opportunities, safe public spaces, and decision-making processes. Youth, too, represent a vibrant cohort whose perspectives and active participation are crucial for inclusive and sustainable urban development. Meanwhile, inclusive and participatory planning ensure that diverse communities' needs and aspirations are appropriately integrated into urban policies and interventions.

In summary, SDG 11 calls for transformative actions to realize inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities. As elucidated by this report, the challenges are complex and multifaceted. The issues of housing, basic services, public spaces, environmental sustainability, and integrated policies require targeted efforts and multifaceted approaches. By streamlining efforts, bolstering partnerships, and ensuring adequate resources, it is possible to make considerable progress in realizing the vision of SDG 11. Truly sustainable cities are not only beneficial for their inhabitants but also contribute significantly to overall global sustainable development.
