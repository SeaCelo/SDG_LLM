EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This detailed analytical report aims to provide an in-depth assessment of SDG 11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities, from the perspective of the Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN). Targeted at an expert audience, this report delves into key issues, challenges, and potential solutions pertaining to sustainable urban development.

INTRODUCTION

Urbanization is an ever-increasing global phenomenon, with more than half of the world's population currently residing in cities. Recognizing the importance of creating sustainable and inclusive cities, the United Nations formulated SDG 11 as a blueprint for achieving this objective. The Aga Khan Development Network, through its multidimensional approach, has made significant contributions to improving the quality of life in urban areas.

URBAN CHALLENGES

1. Rapid Population Growth: Urban areas face immense challenges in accommodating the rapidly growing population while ensuring access to essential services, adequate housing, and basic infrastructure. The AKDN recognizes the significance of population planning in creating sustainable cities and advocates for the integration of social and economic inclusion in urban development strategies.

2. Inadequate Housing: Accessible and affordable housing is a critical issue in many cities globally. Ensuring the provision of decent housing while addressing the growing demand is integral to sustainable urban development. The AKDN emphasizes the use of innovative architecture and design to create housing solutions that promote livability and architectural heritage.

3. Informal Settlements: Unplanned settlements are prevalent in many developing countries, leading to challenges in providing basic services and perpetuating social inequalities. The AKDN promotes community-led development approaches to upgrading informal settlements, focusing on infrastructure improvement, access to clean water and sanitation, and social cohesion.

4. Environmental Degradation: Urbanization can result in increased pollution, deforestation, and loss of biodiversity. The AKDN advocates for inclusive and comprehensive environmental planning that involves multiple stakeholders to mitigate the adverse impacts of urban growth. Sustainable transportation, waste management systems, and green infrastructure are emphasized as key components.

SOLUTIONS AND INNOVATIONS

1. Integrated Urban Planning: The AKDN emphasizes the importance of integrated urban planning, considering social, economic, and environmental dimensions. This approach helps tackle housing, transportation, and infrastructure challenges holistically and encourages participatory decision-making processes that involve communities, civil society, and local governments.

2. Heritage Conservation: A unique perspective of the AKDN is its emphasis on preserving the cultural heritage of urban areas. Conservation of historic sites and monuments not only contributes to cultural revitalization but also enhances tourism and the overall attractiveness of cities. Adaptive reuse and rejuvenation projects, such as the revitalization of Al-Azhar Park in Cairo, serve as examples of AKDN initiatives that promote sustainable urban growth while preserving cultural heritage.

3. Social and Economic Inclusion: AKDN recognizes that truly sustainable cities must prioritize social and economic inclusion. Efforts are made to empower marginalized communities by creating economic opportunities, providing quality education, and supporting healthcare and social services. Through initiatives such as the Aga Khan Trust for Culture's Historic Cities Program, urban regeneration is achieved in a manner that benefits all residents.

4. Public-Private Partnerships: The AKDN understands the importance of strategic partnerships for successful urban development. Collaborative efforts with governments, local authorities, and the private sector have proven effective in creating sustainable urban communities. Examples include the establishment of the Planning and Development Department in the Aga Khan Agency for Habitat, which aims at fostering partnerships to support urban development in various countries.

CONCLUSION

The Aga Khan Development Network's extensive experience in sustainable urban development allows for rich insights into the challenges and potential solutions aligned with SDG 11. By prioritizing integrated planning, heritage conservation, social inclusion, and fostering partnerships, the AKDN plays a crucial role in the global quest for sustainable cities and communities. Through its diverse initiatives, the AKDN actively contributes to the achievement of SDG 11, ultimately striving to improve the quality of life for urban inhabitants and create harmonious, equitable, and resilient urban environments.
