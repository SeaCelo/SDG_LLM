Introduction:
The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11 aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. This comprehensive goal recognizes the imperative of developing sustainable urban areas to accommodate the increasing global urban population. This report, written by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA), provides a detailed analysis of SDG 11's current state, with a special emphasis on its link to middle-income countries.

Current State of SDG 11:
1) Rapid Urbanization: The world is witnessing an unprecedented pace of urbanization, with the global urban population projected to reach 6.7 billion by 2050. This task becomes crucial for middle-income countries, which are experiencing remarkable urban growth rates.

2) Challenges in Infrastructure Development: Middle-income countries face complex challenges when it comes to developing infrastructure that meets the demands of urbanization. Critically, these countries must strike a balance between managing urban expansion, optimizing energy consumption, and ensuring equitable access to basic services such as water, sanitation, housing, and transportation.

3) Housing and Slum Upgradation: Many middle-income countries still struggle with inadequate housing conditions and informal settlements. Addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach, including slum upgrading projects, affordable housing programs, and the integration of marginalized communities into urban planning processes.

4) Climate Change Resilience: Urban areas in middle-income countries face unique climate change risks due to their tropical geographies and location in areas susceptible to natural hazards. Enhancing the resilience of cities through measures such as climate-smart infrastructure, disaster risk reduction strategies, and urban planning that integrates nature-based solutions becomes crucial for SDG 11's success.

5) Inclusive Urban Planning and Governance: Building inclusive, participatory, and accountable institutions plays a pivotal role in attaining SDG 11. Middle-income countries must empower local authorities, civil society organizations, and communities to actively engage in decision-making processes. This will ensure that urban planning and governance frameworks are responsive to the needs of all residents, including vulnerable and marginalized populations.

Best Practices:
Several middle-income countries have made notable progress in achieving SDG 11, serving as potential models for others to emulate:

1) Curitiba, Brazil: Known for its innovative urban planning, this city successfully implemented a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system, prioritizing sustainable and efficient public transportation solutions. Not only did this reduce congestion and emissions, but it also provided improved accessibility and affordability for residents.

2) Medellín, Colombia: This city transformed itself by investing in social infrastructure, fostering community engagement, and implementing transformative urban policies. Through initiatives such as public escalators in hilly areas, cable car systems, and revitalizing marginalized neighborhoods, Medellín improved mobility, reduced social disparities, and enhanced citizen satisfaction.

Recommendations:
To accelerate progress towards SDG 11, the following strategies are recommended for middle-income countries:

1) Sustainable Urban Planning: Enhancing urban planning capacities, especially at the local level, is vital. Governments should prioritize the integration of sustainability principles, climate adaptation, and inclusive land-use strategies in urban development plans. Spatial planning approaches should strive to create mixed-use neighborhoods, foster compact cities, and promote a diversity of residential options.

2) Investments in Resilient Infrastructure: Middle-income countries require sustainable financing mechanisms to invest in climate-resilient infrastructure projects. Building partnerships with international financial institutions, private sector investors, and philanthropic organizations can help mobilize the necessary resources. Innovative funding mechanisms, such as green bonds or public-private partnerships, can be explored to attract necessary capital.

3) Knowledge Sharing and Capacity Building: South-South and triangular cooperation can play a crucial role in promoting knowledge exchange on best practices, experiences, and innovative solutions. Middle-income countries should actively participate in networks, conferences, and technical workshops to learn from peers facing similar urban challenges.

Conclusion:
SDG 11 addresses the complexities of achieving sustainable and inclusive urbanization in middle-income countries. By striving for equitable, resilient, and environmentally friendly cities, these countries can unlock immense potential for economic growth, social development, and environmental sustainability. To succeed, effective urban planning, climate change adaptation strategies, and investment in resilient infrastructure are necessary. By implementing these recommendations and fostering global partnerships, middle-income countries can ensure that no one is left behind on the path towards sustainable urbanization.
