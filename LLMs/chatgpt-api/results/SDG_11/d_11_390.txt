Executive Summary:

This report aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11) - Sustainable Cities and Communities. As the World Trade Organization (WTO), we recognize the crucial role played by cities in sustainable development, and the importance of fostering inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable urbanization. This report evaluates the progress made towards achieving SDG 11, highlights challenges and opportunities, and proposes recommendations to further advance the implementation of this goal.

1. Introduction:
SDG 11 seeks to ensure that cities and human settlements are inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. The objective encompasses a broad set of urban challenges, from slum upgrades and affordable housing to improved urban planning and sustainable transportation systems. By achieving SDG 11, we can create cities that are livable, attractive to investment, and reduce their ecological footprint.

2. Progress on SDG 11:
Significant progress has been made globally towards SDG 11. For instance, the percentage of people living in slum-like conditions has declined, demonstrating successful efforts in addressing urban poverty. Many cities are implementing effective urban planning strategies to enhance the sustainability of their infrastructure, while promoting equitable access to urban services. Additionally, the adoption of technology and innovative policies has been instrumental in achieving sustainable urban mobility and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in some cities.

3. Challenges faced:
Despite the progress made, several challenges limit the full realization of SDG 11. Rapid urbanization, coupled with the lack of comprehensive planning, often leads to increased inequality, inadequate housing, and insufficient public services. The expansion of slums poses significant challenges to achieving financial inclusion and social cohesion. Additionally, many cities still face limited access to clean energy and safe drinking water, exacerbated by unsustainable consumption patterns and inadequate waste management systems.

4. Global Comparative Analysis:
To assess the performance of countries in achieving SDG 11, a comparative analysis is useful. The report examines various cases, such as Singapore, Curitiba, and Copenhagen, which have displayed exemplary practices in urban planning, sustainable transportation, and community engagement. By analyzing successful initiatives in these cities, policymakers can learn from best practices and replicate them in their own contexts.

5. Opportunities for Advancement:
To accelerate progress towards SDG 11, this report identifies opportunities for policymakers to address persistent challenges adequately. First, governments can prioritize affordable housing initiatives that meet the needs of marginalized populations. Active measures to prevent slum growth should be taken, providing secure tenure and upgrading informal settlements. Second, investing in sustainable urban infrastructure and transport systems can enhance accessibility and reduce the environmental impact of cities. Further, the establishment of multi-sectoral partnerships can promote knowledge sharing and strengthen efforts towards sustainable urbanization.

6. Recommendations:
Based on the analysis and identification of opportunities, the report offers recommendations for policymakers to advance SDG 11. Firstly, countries should integrate SDG 11 principles into national urbanization policies and development plans to mainstream sustainable practices. Secondly, strategic spatial planning should be given priority to ensure efficient land use and minimize disparities between neighborhoods. Thirdly, promoting green building practices and retrofitting existing infrastructure can make cities more energy-efficient. Lastly, stakeholders should engage in public-private partnerships to leverage technological advancements and innovatively finance sustainable urban development projects.

Conclusion:
SDG 11 holds great promise for creating cities and communities that are environmentally sustainable, socially inclusive, economically vibrant, and resilient. Although challenges persist, progress has been made globally towards this goal. By implementing the recommendations highlighted in this report, policymakers can drive transformative change, enabling cities to contribute further towards sustainable development. The WTO recognizes the importance of sustainable cities and is committed to supporting countries in achieving SDG 11 through collaboration, capacity-building, and policy advocacy.
