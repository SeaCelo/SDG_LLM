Executive Summary

This analytical report seeks to provide a comprehensive assessment of the current status and challenges pertaining to Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11) in middle-income countries. SDG 11, also referred to as "Sustainable Cities and Communities," targets the development of inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities. This report has been prepared by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and is intended for an expert audience.

Introduction and Context

Middle-income countries face unique opportunities and challenges as they strive to achieve SDG 11. These countries have experienced rapid urbanization, resulting in the rise of mega-cities characterized by increased population densities, inadequate infrastructure, and resource constraints. Furthermore, middle-income countries are often grappling with social inequalities, environmental degradation, and insufficient governance capacities. Therefore, a targeted approach is required to address the specific needs and ensure sustainable urban growth in these nations.

Status of SDG 11 in Middle-Income Countries

Middle-income countries have made significant progress towards achieving SDG 11 but continue to face numerous challenges. They are faced with multiple dimensions of urban poverty, characterized by slums, inadequate housing, and limited access to basic services such as water, sanitation, and electricity. Environmental threats, such as pollution, waste management, and vulnerability to natural disasters, also pose significant challenges to sustainable development.

Moreover, social inequalities persist, as income disparities often lead to exclusion of marginalized populations from accessing services and opportunities. Issues related to urban governance, including the formulation of effective policies, institutional coordination, and sustainable financing, further hinder the attainment of SDG 11.

Key Challenges and Issues

1. Rapid Urbanization: Middle-income countries are experiencing high rates of urbanization, resulting in the expansion of cities beyond their capacity to provide adequate infrastructure and services. Integrated urban planning and upgrading of existing settlements are necessary to address these challenges and ensure that urban growth is sustainable.

2. Housing and Slum Upgrading: The demand for affordable and adequate housing has outpaced the supply in many middle-income countries. This has resulted in the rise of slums and informal settlements, where housing conditions and sanitation are inadequate. Engaging in slum upgrading efforts and investing in affordable housing schemes is crucial for SDG 11.

3. Inclusive Social Infrastructure: Access to social amenities and equitable provision of basic services, such as healthcare facilities, education, and public transportation, remains a challenge in many middle-income countries. Addressing the social infrastructure deficit is essential to achieving sustainability and inclusivity in urban environments.

4. Environmental Sustainability: Middle-income countries face immense pressure on their ecosystems, exacerbated by industrialization, air and water pollution, and unsustainable waste management practices. Commitment to sustainable consumption and production patterns, renewable energy sources, and climate change resilience strategies is imperative to achieve SDG 11.

Recommendations

1. Strengthen Urban Governance: Middle-income countries need to improve governance capacities and mechanisms for urban planning, policy formulation, and implementation. This includes enhancing local governments' capacities, promoting citizen participation, and ensuring accountability.

2. Transition towards Sustainable Transportation: Encourage the development of efficient and sustainable public transportation systems, which can reduce congestion, air pollution, and dependence on private vehicles.

3. Mainstream Climate Resilience: Incorporate climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies into urban planning, infrastructure development, and building codes to enhance the resilience of cities in middle-income countries.

4. Promote Innovative Financing: Middle-income countries need to explore innovative sources of financing, such as public-private partnerships, impact investments, and green bonds, to address the resource constraints in achieving SDG 11.

Conclusion

While middle-income countries have made significant strides towards achieving SDG 11, numerous challenges require urgent attention. This report has highlighted the major issues faced by these countries in their pursuit of sustainable urban development. Implementing the recommended actions can pave the way for inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities while ensuring that no one is left behind in the process. ESCAP, in partnership with relevant stakeholders, must continue to support middle-income countries in their journey towards SDG 11, promoting sustainable urbanization and improving the quality of life for all.
