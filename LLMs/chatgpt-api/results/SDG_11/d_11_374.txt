Introduction:

In this analytical report, we will delve into Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11) which focuses on making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. As an esteemed organization committed to sustainable development, the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) recognizes the significance of SDG 11 and the crucial role it plays in creating livable and equitable communities. This report aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the current state of SDG 11 targets and progress made towards attaining its goals within the Islamic Development Bank's member countries.

Overview of SDG 11:

SDG 11 primarily aims to transform cities and urban areas to become sustainable and resilient, meeting the needs of a rapidly urbanizing world. There are several key targets associated with SDG 11, which we will explore individually, including access to adequate housing, provision of basic services, sustainable transport, inclusive urban planning, and revitalization of cultural and natural heritage.

1. Land-use Planning and Management:
An initial assessment of IsDB member countries reveals that most face significant challenges related to urbanization and land-use planning. Rapid urban growth often leads to an uncontrolled expansion of informal settlements, inadequate provision of infrastructure, and a depletion of natural resources. A notable example is the rapid urbanization of cities like Karachi (Pakistan), where a scarcity of land and unplanned settlements pose serious challenges to inclusive and sustainable cities.

To address this, the IsDB has encouraged member countries to formulate comprehensive land-use planning strategies at the national and subnational levels. These strategies aim to optimize land resources, ensure affordable housing options, and promote sustainable economic development. An example worth highlighting is Malaysia's National Physical Plan (NPP), which outlines a spatial framework for urban growth while preserving natural resources and cultural heritage.

2. Access to Safe and Affordable Housing:
Access to safe and affordable housing remains a pressing concern within many member countries of the IsDB. Rapid urbanization often leads to unequal distribution of housing resources, forcing vulnerable populations into informal settlements lacking basic services and infrastructure. This poses severe health and safety risks, coupled with social and economic marginalization.

To tackle this challenge, the IsDB has supported initiatives aimed at increasing the availability of affordable housing. For instance, the bank has financed the construction of low-cost housing units in Bangladesh, which not only address the housing gap but also provide adequate infrastructure and essential services. Additionally, the IsDB has developed innovative financing mechanisms, such as Islamic microfinance, to make housing affordable for low-income groups.

3. Sustainable Transport and Infrastructure:
Sustainable transport infrastructure is crucial for creating inclusive and sustainable cities. It is essential to reduce congestion, improve air quality, promote efficiency, enhance accessibility, and ensure the safety of commuters. Many member countries of the IsDB face significant challenges related to urban transport, including inadequate public transportation systems, limited pedestrian and cycling infrastructure, and an overreliance on private cars.

To mitigate these challenges, the IsDB has placed significant emphasis on funding transport projects that promote sustainability and multimodal connectivity. Projects like the Bus Rapid Transit System in Istanbul (Turkey) and the Light Rail Transit System in Jakarta (Indonesia) have received funding from the IsDB. These initiatives not only improve commuting options but also reduce congestion, pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions.

4. Inclusive Urban Planning and Management:
Achieving sustainable development requires inclusive urban planning and management practices. It is essential for policymakers to engage all stakeholders and ensure that no one is left behind in the decision-making process. Many member countries of the IsDB face challenges such as exclusionary urban policies, lack of citizen participation, and inadequate capacity in urban planning institutions.

To address these challenges, the IsDB has prioritized supporting initiatives that encourage citizen participation, promote gender equality, and inclusion in urban planning processes. An exemplary project is the Participatory Slum Upgrading Program in Bangladesh, where slum dwellers actively collaborate with government agencies and development partners to improve their living conditions. Such initiatives increase social cohesion, foster community ownership, and contribute to the achievement of SDG 11 targets.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the Islamic Development Bank recognizes the importance of SDG 11 in creating sustainable and inclusive cities. Through its various initiatives, the IsDB is actively collaborating with member countries to address challenges related to land-use planning, access to safe and affordable housing, sustainable transport, and inclusive urban planning. It is critical for the IsDB and stakeholders in its member countries to continue working towards the fulfillment of SDG 11, fostering resilient and livable cities for future generations.
