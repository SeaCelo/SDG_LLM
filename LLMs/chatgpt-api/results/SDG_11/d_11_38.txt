Introduction:
The Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11) aims to ensure inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable cities and human settlements. This goal focuses on the development of towns and cities that can accommodate the increasing population while also addressing social, economic, and environmental challenges. In this expert analytical report, we will examine the progress of SDG 11 with a specific focus on the least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs).

Overview and Challenges for LDCs:
LDCs, being the most economically vulnerable countries, face several daunting challenges in achieving SDG 11. Insufficient infrastructure, rapid urbanization, lack of resources, and limited access to financing are critical obstacles. Many LDCs encounter slum-like conditions, inadequate housing, and unsafe living environments, predominantly due to limited investment in urban development strategies. These countries also struggle with poor waste management systems and inadequate transport networks. Strengthening the capacity of LDCs to plan, implement, and manage sustainable urbanization is crucial for achieving SDG 11 in these countries.

Progress and Concerns in SIDS:
SIDS, due to their unique geographical locations and vulnerability to climate change, face distinct challenges in attaining SDG 11. These countries rely heavily on their natural resources and face threats such as rising sea levels, intensified natural disasters, and limited access to potable water. Challenges also arise from limited land availability, ongoing land erosion, and the need to preserve their cultural heritage while developing modern settlements. While some SIDS have made progress in developing sustainable tourism and resilient infrastructure, many still face roadblocks due to financial constraints and issues with policy coherence. A comprehensive approach that combines disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation, and sustainable tourism development is essential for SIDS in achieving SDG 11.

Addressing Challenges in LLDCs:
LLDCs, being geographically landlocked, face unique challenges in integrating with neighboring countries and accessing local, regional, and international markets. Inadequate infrastructure, such as roads, rail connections, and ports, hinder economic growth and impede the efficient movement of goods, services, and people. In LLDCs, the concentration of the population in urban areas exerts immense pressure on existing infrastructure, exacerbating congestion, air pollution, and energy consumption. Multiple stakeholders' cooperation is required at national, regional, and international levels to address these challenges and facilitate sustainable urban development in LLDCs.

Opportunities and Best Practices:
To make further progress towards SDG 11 in LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs, it is important to leverage existing opportunities and learn from best practices. The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) has been promoting the development of smart cities in the Asia-Pacific region. Smart cities integrate technology and innovative solutions to promote sustainable and inclusive urban development. Implementing smart city initiatives could offer valuable insights and potential pathways for LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs to achieve SDG 11. Additionally, promoting sustainable urbanization practices, such as eco-friendly infrastructure, efficient public transportation, and affordable housing schemes, can create more resilient and livable cities in these countries.

Conclusion:
Achieving SDG 11 requires significant efforts from LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs to overcome their unique challenges. Financing, capacity building, and policy coherence are critical components in addressing the diverse needs of these countries. Leveraging opportunities presented by smart city initiatives, along with promoting sustainable urbanization practices, can pave the way for more livable and resilient cities in these regions. Collaboration among relevant stakeholders, both at national and international levels, is essential to ensure no country is left behind in the pursuit of sustainable cities and settlements.
