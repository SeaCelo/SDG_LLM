Introduction:
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is pleased to present this detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11) for an expert audience. SDG 11 seeks to ensure that cities and human settlements are inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable by 2030. This report will provide a comprehensive analysis of the current progress, challenges, and opportunities related to SDG 11, particularly from the perspective of forcibly displaced populations.

The Inclusion of Displaced Persons:
One of the key objectives of SDG 11 is to make cities and human settlements inclusive for all individuals. However, the global refugee crisis poses significant challenges in achieving the goal of inclusion. Displaced persons often face legal barriers, social stigma, and limited access to basic services in host communities, which hampers their integration and participation in urban settings.

For displaced populations, inclusion necessitates efforts to provide them with legal recognition, access to education, healthcare, and employment opportunities. It requires the establishment of inclusive urban policies and platforms that prioritize the needs of these vulnerable individuals. Furthermore, strengthening partnerships between governments, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders is crucial for addressing the multifaceted nature of the inclusion challenge.

Ensuring Safety and Resilience:
SDG 11 emphasizes the importance of ensuring safety and resilience in cities and human settlements. This objective is particularly pertinent for displaced populations, as they often reside in overcrowded and fragile environments, which lack adequate infrastructure and resources. Furthermore, forced displacement is often a consequence of conflicts and disasters, which increase vulnerability and exacerbate the need for safe and resilient urban environments.

To address this challenge, it is imperative to promote urban planning and management practices that prioritize the safety and resilience of displaced populations. This includes enhancing building standards, implementing early warning systems, and developing robust evacuation plans in disaster-prone areas. In conflict-affected settings, engaging with local communities and providing them with confidence-building infrastructure can help create a secure and stable urban environment.

Achieving Sustainable Development:
Sustainable urban development lies at the core of SDG 11, encompassing various aspects such as housing, transportation, and resource management. It is crucial for forced displacement scenarios, as these populations frequently strain existing urban resources and ecosystems. In addition, unsustainable urban growth, if not properly managed, can perpetuate inequalities and deepen the social and environmental challenges faced by displaced populations.

To achieve sustainability, efforts should focus on improving access to affordable and adequate housing for displaced persons, particularly in urban areas where the demand is high. This requires innovative and inclusive approaches, such as involving international and local architectural firms in designing resilient housing solutions tailored to the specific needs of these populations. Furthermore, sustainable transportation systems and the implementation of efficient waste management strategies are essential to create environmentally friendly urban landscapes.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, SDG 11 provides a critical framework for addressing the complex challenges faced by forcibly displaced populations in cities and human settlements. Achieving the goals of inclusion, safety, resilience, and sustainability for these vulnerable individuals requires prioritizing their needs, engaging diverse stakeholders, and implementing comprehensive policies and actions.

The UNHCR recognizes that the full realization of SDG 11 will require political will, adequate resources, and strong partnerships to address the scale and complexity of the global refugee crisis. By focusing on the unique circumstances faced by displaced populations, countries can promote equitable and sustainable urban development, which in turn will contribute to more inclusive and resilient societies for all.
