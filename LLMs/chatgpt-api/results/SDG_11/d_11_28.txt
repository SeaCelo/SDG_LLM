The Sustainable Development Goal 11 aims to make cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. This comprehensive goal pertains to both urban and rural areas, as it recognizes the crucial role that cities play in achieving sustainable development. In striving towards this goal, it is crucial to focus on the specific challenges faced by least developed countries (LDCs), small island developing states (SIDS), and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs). In this report, we will analyze the current state of SDG 11 in these regions, highlighting key issues, progress made, and areas that require further attention.

LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs face unique challenges due to their inherent geographical and socio-economic characteristics. Many of these countries experience rapid urbanization combined with high levels of poverty and limited access to basic services. This situation creates a pressing need to address the urban infrastructure gap, providing equitable access to adequate housing, reliable transport systems, public spaces, and sustainable energy sources.

One of the key challenges faced by these countries is the unequal distribution of resources and services between urban and rural areas. While urban centers tend to enjoy better infrastructure, services, and employment opportunities, rural areas often remain underserved and marginalized. This disparity exacerbates rural-urban migration and hampers efforts to achieve sustainable urbanization.

LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs are also particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. As many SIDS are situated in low-lying coastal areas, they are significantly exposed to sea-level rise, extreme weather events, and other climate-related hazards. Furthermore, these countries often lack the technical and financial resources required to adapt to changing climate conditions and implement resilient urban planning strategies.

Despite these challenges, progress has been made in several areas. Many LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs have made commitments to sustainable urban development and have developed national strategies and action plans aligned with SDG 11. These initiatives focus on improving urban governance, enhancing resilience, strengthening urban planning and management capacities, and developing sustainable transportation systems.

Efforts have also been made to enhance access to affordable housing and basic services in these countries. For example, LDCs have implemented slum upgrading programs, involving the provision of infrastructure and basic services in informal settlements. In SIDS, investment in renewable energy has helped to reduce dependency on fossil fuels and increase energy access in remote areas. LLDCs have prioritized the development of transport infrastructure and transit corridors to improve connectivity and facilitate trade.

However, significant challenges remain. Financing for sustainable urban development in LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs continues to be a major hurdle. Many of these countries face difficulties in mobilizing domestic resources and accessing international financing mechanisms, which limits their capacity to implement sustainable urbanization initiatives.

Promoting inclusivity and ensuring the participation of marginalized groups, such as women, youth, and persons with disabilities, also requires additional attention. Furthermore, fostering resilience and enhancing adaptation to climate change in the urban context should be at the forefront of priorities, as the impacts of climate change are projected to intensify.

To address these challenges and accelerate progress towards SDG 11, it is crucial to strengthen multi-stakeholder partnerships and further engage subnational and local authorities, civil society organizations, and the private sector. Sharing best practices and exchanging knowledge among countries facing similar challenges can also contribute to effective solutions.

In conclusion, SDG 11 is of utmost importance for least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries. These regions face unique challenges in achieving sustainable urban development due to their specific context and vulnerabilities. Although progress has been made, concerted efforts are needed to bridge the urban-rural divide, enhance climate resilience, and mobilize adequate financing. By prioritizing the needs of LDCs, SIDS, and LLDCs and tailoring actions to their specific context, we can work towards creating inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities worldwide.
