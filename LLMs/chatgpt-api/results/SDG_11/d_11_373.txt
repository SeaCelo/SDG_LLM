The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is pleased to present this detailed analytical report addressing Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11) on Sustainable Cities and Communities. As a global humanitarian organization, focused on resilience-building and promoting sustainable development, the IFRC recognizes the critical importance of this goal in securing a healthy, safe, and inclusive future for all.

Introduction:
Sustainable Development Goal 11 seeks to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. The goal recognizes that cities are centers of innovation and economic growth but also face significant challenges, such as rapid urbanization, congestion, and unequal access to resources. The mandate is both to improve living conditions for urban populations and preserve natural resources through sustainable practices. By discussing the achievements, challenges, the way forward, and examples of best practices, this report aims to contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the situation.

Major Achievements:
Several notable achievements have been made towards SDG 11 since its adoption in 2015. One key advancement is the increasing recognition of the role that cities and communities play in sustainable development. Governments, local authorities, and civil society organizations have collaborated to develop urban plans and policies that prioritize sustainability and resilience. Platforms such as the World Urban Forum and the Cities Alliance have facilitated knowledge exchange and encouraged the adoption of innovative solutions.

Furthermore, the widespread implementation of affordable and efficient public transportation systems in cities has significantly reduced carbon emissions and congestion. This progress reflects the growing commitment to sustainable mobility. In addition, access to basic services such as clean water, sanitation, and electricity has improved for several urban communities, contributing to an enhanced quality of life.

Challenges and Gaps:
Notwithstanding these achievements, numerous challenges and gaps persist in realizing the goals of SDG 11. Urbanization continues to outpace efforts in infrastructure development, resulting in slums and informal settlements in many regions of the world. Informal settlements lack basic services, struggle with insufficient waste management, and are more vulnerable to natural disasters and the impacts of climate change.

Another prominent challenge lies in the lack of affordable and adequate housing options, affecting both low-income and marginalized populations. The high cost of real estate contributes to urban poverty and social exclusion, making it difficult for individuals and families to access affordable housing in well-located areas.

Moreover, governance gaps at the local level remain an obstacle to effective policy implementation. Capacities of local authorities must be reinforced to ensure inclusive urban planning, participatory decision-making processes, and sustainable resource management. Additionally, efforts to integrate resilience and sustainability considerations into urban planning face implementation challenges due to competing priorities, lack of financing, and fragmented governance structures.

The Way Forward:
To address these challenges and achieve SDG 11, concerted efforts are required from various stakeholders. Firstly, local and national governments must prioritize urban planning that is inclusive, participatory, and contextually appropriate. Increased investments in infrastructure, particularly in low-income settlements, are necessary to provide access to basic services, such as clean water, sanitation, and affordable housing.

In addition, the private sector can contribute by adopting sustainable practices throughout their operations and fostering innovation for urban sustainability. Public-private partnerships and innovative financing mechanisms can be explored to leverage resources for sustainable urban development projects.

Strengthening governance at the local level is vital to enhance coordination and accountability. Technical assistance and capacity-building initiatives should be provided to empower local authorities, enabling them to develop and implement sustainable urban policies in line with the targets of SDG 11.

Examples of Best Practices:
Various cities and communities worldwide have embraced sustainable and inclusive urban development, providing valuable lessons and best practices for others to follow. For instance, Barcelona has prioritized pedestrians and cyclists by implementing a low-carbon transportation system, which has not only reduced congestion but also improved air quality. Singapore is an exemplary model for urban resilience, demonstrating effective urban planning with a focus on energy efficiency, smart technologies, and climate adaptation.

Another significant example is Curitiba in Brazil, renowned for its integrated and efficient public transportation system. By investing in a comprehensive bus network and creating dedicated lanes, Curitiba significantly reduced congestion and the associated environmental impacts.

Conclusion:
Achieving SDG 11 is vital for ensuring sustainable, inclusive, and resilient cities and communities. While progress has been made in implementing various initiatives and policy changes, challenges and gaps persist. Addressing informal settlements, affordable housing, and governance issues remains critical for advancing the agenda. However, notable accomplishments in urban planning and solutions-oriented initiatives bring hope for a more sustainable urban future. The IFRC strives to collaborate with stakeholders towards the realization of SDG 11 and contribute to building inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities for generations to come.
