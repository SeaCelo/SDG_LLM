Urbanization in the 21st century has posed significant challenges to cities across the globe. As more people flock to urban centers in search of better opportunities, resources and infrastructure are being stretched to their limits. In light of this, the United Nations developed the Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11) – an ambitious blueprint aimed at making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable by 2030.

The goal is commendable, considering that currently more than half of the world's population reside in cities, and it is estimated that by 2050, this number will skyrocket to over two-thirds. To ensure a flourishing urban future, addressing the challenges identified in SDG 11 is crucial.

Inclusivity lies at the heart of SDG 11. It emphasizes the need to make cities accessible to all – regardless of age, gender, socioeconomic status, or disability. This means creating cities that provide equal access to basic services such as housing, healthcare, education, and transportation. It also entails promoting social cohesion and harmony, valuing diverse cultural practices, and guaranteeing the participation of all citizens in decision-making processes.

Safety and resilience play important roles in sustainable urban development. SDG 11 calls for measures to reduce the vulnerability of cities to natural disasters. Climate change has intensified the frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events, putting urban settlements at greater risk. Cities must invest in robust infrastructure, prepare emergency response plans, and strengthen community resilience to ensure the safety of their inhabitants.

Sustainability is a fundamental aspect of SDG 11 – striving for the optimal use of resources while minimizing environmental impact. This involves creating green spaces, implementing clean and renewable energy systems, improving waste management, and adopting sustainable transportation alternatives. Assuring that cities are built sustainably now and in the future means taking into account the principles of circular economy and reducing carbon emissions.

The achievement of SDG 11 presents a range of opportunities for cities worldwide. Not only do the outcomes benefit the environment and human well-being, but they can also foster economic growth and innovation. By implementing sustainable practices and aligning with the SDG, cities can attract investment, generate employment, and transform into vibrant hubs of creativity and productivity.

Several cities have already made remarkable progress towards SDG 11. Take Copenhagen for example, known for its commitment to sustainability. The Danish capital has invested heavily in cycling infrastructure, resulting in an impressive 62% of its residents commuting by bike every day. Moreover, Copenhagen is on track to become carbon neutral by 2025 and operates an extensive recycling system that produces heat and energy. Such initiatives serve as a shining example to other cities seeking sustainable development.

However, it is important to acknowledge that not all cities share the same resources, capacities, or starting points. While larger cities might have greater financial and political capabilities to tackle the challenges of SDG 11, smaller cities and developing countries require support to ensure sustainable urbanization. This necessitates international cooperation, financial assistance, and knowledge sharing among cities, institutions, and stakeholders from all corners of the globe.

The onus is on governments, policymakers, urban planners, businesses, and citizens to work together and contribute their expertise toward achieving the targets set by SDG 11. It's high time we recognized the importance of sustainable and resilient cities on the road to a sustainable future.

The Boston Globe encourages all leaders and communities to prioritize SDG 11 in their agendas and take ambitious action. By investing in inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable cities, we can forge a path towards a future where the potential of humanity thrives harmoniously with the planet. It's time to embrace the principles of SDG 11 and build the cities we deserve – livable, equitable, and sustainable for generations to come.
