INTRODUCTION

This report analyzes the progress and challenges related to Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11) - "Make cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable." Engaging experts in urban development, disaster risk reduction, and sustainable housing, this report delves into various indicators under SDG 11, highlighting their current status, gaps, and potential interventions.

URBAN PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT

Effective urban planning plays a critical role in creating inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities. Despite progress, numerous challenges persist, including rapid urbanization, inadequate infrastructure, affordability issues, and spatial inequalities. Stated interventions emphasize the need for participatory planning, efficient land use management, and inclusive decision-making processes.

Case studies from various cities document successful urban planning experiences. The City Development Strategy (CDS) in Curitiba, Brazil, effectively promoted sustainable transportation systems and empowered citizens through participatory urban planning. Similarly, the Shenzhen Model in China showcases innovative approaches to urbanization, integrating economic, social, and environmental dimensions.

AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SLUM UPGRADING

Ensuring access to affordable and adequate housing for all inhabitants is a fundamental aspect of SDG 11. Unfortunately, housing challenges such as unaffordability, informal settlements, and slums hinder progress towards this goal. Adequate investments and improved housing policies are imperative, targeting vulnerable populations and promoting inclusivity.

The Baan Mankong Program in Thailand is an outstanding example of successful slum upgrading initiatives. By supporting community-led housing initiatives, access to affordable housing and improved living conditions were achieved, illustrating the importance of leveraging local knowledge and capacities.

SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS

Efficient and sustainable transport systems are crucial for achieving SDG 11. It involves increasing access to affordable, safe, and sustainable transport options while minimizing environmental impact. However, a significant urban transport backlog remains, negatively impacting mobility, air quality, and road safety.

Bogot√°'s TransMilenio Bus Rapid Transit system is recognized as a pioneering initiative that positively impacted urban sustainability. It enhanced mobility, reduced emissions, and offered affordable services to residents. Other examples include Copenhagen's cycling infrastructure and Seoul's comprehensive integration of public transportation modes.

DISASTER RISK REDUCTION AND RESILIENCE

The resilience of cities against disasters is a vital component of Goal 11. Urban areas are particularly vulnerable to natural hazards, exacerbated by climate change. Enhancing disaster risk reduction measures, improving infrastructure resilience, and ensuring early warning systems are essential to minimize the impacts of disasters on cities and their inhabitants.

The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction provides a coherent global strategy with defined targets for reducing disaster risk. Cities such as Kobe, Japan, utilized this framework to build back better after the Great Hanshin Earthquake in 1995, incorporating seismic-resistant infrastructure, public spaces, and community preparedness measures.

CONCLUSION

While progresses towards achieving SDG 11 have been made, significant challenges remain. Robust urban planning and management, addressing housing crises, promoting sustainable transportation systems, and enhancing disaster resilience are necessary for achieving inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities.

Building on successful experiences and drawing lessons from different contexts, it is crucial to foster collaboration, knowledge sharing, and innovation among governments, civil society, and international organizations. These partnerships will drive the collective efforts required to successfully navigate the complex journey towards sustainable cities, ultimately improving the lives of millions globally. ACTED remains committed to supporting sustainable urban development and looks forward to continued collaboration with expert audiences to achieve SDG 11.
