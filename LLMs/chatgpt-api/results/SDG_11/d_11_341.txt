Introduction:

The Palestinian International Cooperation Agency (PICA) is pleased to present this detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11): "Making cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable." This report aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the current progress and challenges faced by Palestine in achieving SDG 11. It is intended for an expert audience seeking comprehensive insights into the sustainable development agenda concerning urban environments in this specific context.

1. Background and Context:

Palestine is a unique case when it comes to urban development and planning, given its complex political situation and multiple layers of governance. The Israeli occupation and division of Palestinian territories pose significant challenges to achieving sustainable and inclusive cities. Despite these challenges, the Palestinian government, in close cooperation with international agencies, is determined to improve the quality of life in urban areas and ensure sustainable urban development.

2. Urbanization Trends in Palestine:

Palestine has experienced rapid urbanization in recent decades, primarily driven by the growing population and the expansion of cities. The population growth is mainly concentrated in major cities such as Jerusalem, Ramallah, and Gaza City. This rapid urban growth poses considerable challenges, including insufficient infrastructure, inadequate housing, increased informal settlements, and environmental degradation. Addressing these challenges is crucial for achieving the targets set by SDG 11.

3. Priority Areas and Current Progress:

3.1. Access to Adequate Housing and Basic Services:

Improving access to adequate housing and basic services remains a significant challenge, particularly in refugee camps in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Efforts have been made to provide social housing projects, but they still fall short of meeting the demand. The government, in collaboration with international organizations, has implemented programs to address the housing shortage and improve access to water, sanitation, and energy services.

3.2. Transportation and Urban Mobility:

Enhancing sustainable mobility is vital in achieving SDG 11. Palestine has made progress in establishing public transportation systems, including bus networks and light rail projects in cities like Jerusalem. However, these efforts face obstacles due to restrictions imposed by the Israeli authorities and limited urban planning capabilities. Integrated transportation master plans that consider the needs of all residents are being developed to enhance urban mobility and reduce dependence on private vehicles.

3.3. Environmental Sustainability and Resilience:

Increasing resilience and reducing the environmental impact of cities remains a considerable challenge. The continued expansion of settlements and natural resource exploitation by the occupying power pose major threats to the environment. Efforts have been made to enhance solid waste management, promote renewable energy sources, and improve urban green spaces. However, financial constraints, limited capacity, and lack of control over natural resources hinder progress towards achieving sustainable and resilient cities.

4. Challenges and Opportunities for SDG 11:

4.1. Political and Administrative Constraints:

Palestine's political situation significantly affects urban development and planning. The fragmentation of Palestinian territories into disconnected parts prevents cohesive urban planning and hampers access to necessary resources. Furthermore, lack of control over borders, natural resources, and restricted access to construction materials pose significant challenges to the implementation of sustainable urban development plans.

4.2. Financial and Technical Capacities:

Sustainable urban development requires sufficient financial resources and technical expertise. Palestine faces constraints in both aspects, making it challenging to implement comprehensive urban development plans. International aid and partnerships play a crucial role in bridging these gaps. However, long-term financial sustainability and strengthening local capacities are essential for continued progress.

4.3. Legal Framework and Governance:

The absence of a unified legal framework and effective governance structures impedes the implementation of sustainable urban policies. The presence of fragmented authorities, with limited power over land and resources, creates jurisdictional challenges and administrative barriers to coordinated urban planning. Strengthening governance and establishing clear regulation frameworks are required to achieve SDG 11 targets.

5. Best Practices and Lessons Learned:

Despite the challenges, Palestine has demonstrated notable progress in sustainable urban development. Examples of best practices include the establishment of public-private partnerships for sustainable infrastructure projects, collaboration with international organizations in knowledge exchange and capacity-building initiatives, and grassroots community initiatives promoting social inclusion and urban resilience. Sharing these experiences with other countries facing similar challenges can aid in the replication of successful initiatives.

Conclusion:

Palestine has made significant strides towards achieving SDG 11, making cities more inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. However, the pursuit of sustainable urban development is a complex and continuously evolving task, particularly in a context marked by political conflict and occupation. Addressing the challenges outlined in this report requires sustained efforts, increased financial support, strengthened governance structures, and enhanced international cooperation. By learning from both successes and setbacks, Palestine, with the support of the international community, can continue to improve urban living conditions, fostering sustainable development for all.
