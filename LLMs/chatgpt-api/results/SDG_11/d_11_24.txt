The Sustainable Development Goal 11 revolves around making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. It aims to address the challenges posed by rapid urbanization, such as inadequate housing, overburdened infrastructure, and lack of basic services. This fictional report by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) critically assesses the progress of SDG 11 in middle-income countries within the region.

Introduction and Context:
The process of urbanization has been transforming the societies in countless ways. Middle-income countries, particularly those in Latin America and the Caribbean, have been experiencing extensive growth in their urban areas. This rise in urban population poses a significant challenge for policymakers, as ensuring sustainable urban development becomes essential to counteract socio-economic inequities and environmental degradation.

Assessment of SDG 11 Progress:
Despite facing specific challenges, middle-income countries within the region have made noteworthy progress in achieving various targets of SDG 11. The substantial improvement in access to basic services like clean water, sanitation, and housing is significant. Moreover, investments in infrastructure and upgrading of informal settlements demonstrate commitment towards building resilient and sustainable cities.

Inclusivity and Livability:
Attention to inclusivity is vital for middle-income countries, considering the persistence of inequality and substantial differences in living standards. Formalization efforts, regularization of land rights, and access to affordable housing for vulnerable groups have played a crucial role in achieving social development goals. Moreover, the implementation of public policies targeted at enhancing access to education, health care, and safe public spaces has contributed to improving the overall livability of cities.

Environmental Sustainability:
One key focus area of SDG 11 is the acute need to adopt sustainable practices in urban environments to mitigate climate change impacts and foster resilient communities. Middle-income countries are investing in renewable energy sources, implementing waste management strategies, and promoting sustainable transportation systems. In addition, the adoption of eco-friendly building practices and the integration of urban green spaces is gaining momentum, significantly improving the environmental outlook of cities.

Compact and Resilient Cities:
The challenge posed by rapid urbanization calls for strategic planning to foster compact and resilient cities. Middle-income countries have worked towards sustainable urban transport networks, promoting mixed-use developments, and implementing measures to reduce the urban sprawl. Furthermore, the fortification of infrastructure against natural disasters and climate change events is an essential requirement for building resilient cities, ensuring the safety and wellbeing of its inhabitants.

Cross-cutting Concerns:
While progress has been made, certain cross-cutting concerns merit further attention. The urban-rural divide continues to persist, indicative of unequal access to resources, opportunities, and quality of life. Strengthening the coordinated urban-rural development approach can bridge this gap, promoting balanced territorial development and reducing disparities.

Data availability and reliability also pose a challenge, hindering effective monitoring and evidence-based decision-making. Middle-income countries should focus on enhancing data collection infrastructure, aligning statistical indicators with SDG 11 targets, and promoting data sharing platforms to encourage evidence-based policy formulation and evaluation.

Conclusion:
Middle-income countries in Latin America and the Caribbean region have made significant strides towards achieving SDG 11. Improvements in inclusivity, livability, environmental sustainability, and resilience are remarkable, reflecting the commitment of policymakers. However, challenges such as urban-rural divide and data limitations require further attention, highlighting the need for continued efforts to create sustainable, inclusive, and resilient cities for future generations.
