Executive Summary

This report examines the progress and challenges in achieving Sustainable Development Goal 8 (SDG 8) in Afghanistan. SDG 8, "Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all," emphasizes the need to address unemployment, labor rights, and economic growth to enhance livelihoods and foster sustainable development.

Introduction

Afghanistan, a country that has experienced decades of conflict and insecurity, faces considerable challenges in achieving SDG 8. The Afghan government, civil society organizations, and international partners recognize the importance of promoting economic growth, decent work, and productive employment to peacebuilding and national development.

Progress in achieving SDG 8

1. Economic Growth: Afghanistan has achieved notable economic growth in recent years. The average Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate between 2004 and 2018 exceeded 6%. However, this growth has been unevenly distributed, with agriculture and mining sectors performing better than manufacturing and services.

2. Decent Work: Efforts have been made to improve working conditions in Afghanistan. Legislation such as the Afghan Labor Law ensures minimum wage, working hours, and job security. Women have gained greater access to employment opportunities, and child labor has decreased. Nevertheless, there are persistent challenges related to informal work, unpaid labor, and the violation of labor rights.

3. Employment Opportunities: The Afghan government's National Employment Program aims to generate employment opportunities through public and private sector initiatives. Programs such as the National Solidarity Program and Women's Economic Empowerment have helped to create jobs for marginalized communities. However, unemployment rates remain high, particularly among youth and women.

Challenges and Recommendations

1. Security and Instability: Ongoing conflict and terrorism pose significant challenges to SDG 8. To address this, the Afghan government needs to continue focusing on national security and stability, attracting investment, and strengthening infrastructure. International support in rebuilding institutions and promoting stability is essential.

2. Gender Inequality: Gender disparities persist in employment opportunities, wage gaps, and women's representation in decision-making positions. It is crucial to promote gender equality in the workforce through targeted interventions, such as providing vocational training, creating childcare facilities, and implementing gender-responsive policies.

3. Skills Development: Enhancing the skills of the Afghan workforce is pivotal for sustainable economic growth. Expanding access to quality education and vocational training programs, particularly for rural and disadvantaged populations, is critical. Public-private partnerships can play a significant role in developing job-oriented training programs.

4. Informality and Labor Rights: Addressing the high prevalence of informal work and ensuring comprehensive labor protections is crucial. Improving the capacity of labor inspection bodies, raising awareness of workers' rights, and implementing effective mechanisms for labor dispute resolution are essential steps to eradicate exploitative working conditions.

Conclusion

The achievement of SDG 8 in Afghanistan requires a comprehensive and multi-dimensional approach. Addressing the challenges of security, gender inequality, skills development, and labor rights is imperative. The sustained commitment and collaboration of government institutions, international partners, civil society organizations, and the private sector are essential to create an inclusive, sustainable, and resilient economy that fulfills the vision of SDG 8 in Afghanistan.
