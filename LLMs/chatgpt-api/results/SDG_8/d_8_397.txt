The Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN) is pleased to present an analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 8 (SDG 8): Decent Work and Economic Growth. This report aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the current status of SDG 8, its key targets and indicators, and the progress made so far towards achieving this goal. It is intended for an expert audience comprising policymakers, researchers, and development practitioners.

SDG 8 is designed to promote sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all individuals. It recognizes the importance of creating and maintaining inclusive economic systems that facilitate job creation, entrepreneurship, and fair labor market policies. By implementing targeted interventions and policies, SDG 8 strives to achieve both social and economic outcomes, ensuring that no one is left behind in the journey towards development.

One of the key targets under SDG 8 is to achieve sustained and inclusive economic growth, measured by an increase in gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. This serves as an indicator of the overall health and growth potential of an economy. It highlights the significance of productive capacity, innovation, and increased efficiency in driving sustainable economic development.

Drawing from various data sources and case studies, this report provides an assessment of progress made in terms of sustained economic growth. It examines the role of AKDN in harnessing economic potential across its vast network through innovative approaches such as public-private partnerships, investments in human capital, and the promotion of entrepreneurship. Examples of successful interventions include initiatives to expand access to financial services, particularly for women, and the establishment of vocational training centers to equip youth with market-relevant skills.

Furthermore, SDG 8 emphasizes the importance of increasing productivity through sustainable economic diversification, technological upgrading, and value addition. The report analyzes AKDN's efforts in supporting economic diversification, particularly in marginalized regions, by leveraging local resources and traditional knowledge. These efforts often involve revitalizing sectors such as agriculture, tourism, and cultural industries to create new economic opportunities and reduce poverty.

Another critical aspect of SDG 8 is to promote full and productive employment. This report highlights the strides made by AKDN in creating employment opportunities and enhancing labor market participation. It showcases various programs aimed at improving workforce skills, fostering entrepreneurship, and promoting decent work conditions such as fair wages, social protection, and safe working environments.
