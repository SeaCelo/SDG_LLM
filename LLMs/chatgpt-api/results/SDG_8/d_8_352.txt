Turkey is committed to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) outlined by the United Nations, with SDG 8 – Promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all – being particularly pertinent in the country's agenda.

Turkey has made significant progress in the areas of economic growth and decent work in recent years. Its strategic location between Europe and Asia, combined with a sound macroeconomic environment, has made the country an attractive location for trade and investment. This has allowed Turkey to achieve substantial economic growth, with an average annual growth rate of around 5% over the past decade.

In order to promote sustained economic growth, Turkey has implemented several policies and initiatives. One such initiative is the activation of a comprehensive National Development Plan, which prioritizes sustainable economic growth and job creation. The plan focuses on key sectors such as manufacturing, agriculture, tourism, and finance, with special attention given to the development of entrepreneurship, innovation, and technology.

To achieve inclusive economic growth, Turkey has been working towards reducing regional and social disparities. The government has promoted investment in disadvantaged regions, such as the eastern and southeastern parts of the country, to stimulate local economies and create opportunities for decent work. Additionally, social protection programs have been introduced to support vulnerable groups, including the elderly, disabled, and youth.

Turkey has also taken steps to strengthen labor market institutions and policies to address challenges related to productive employment. It has enacted several laws and measures to improve workplace safety, protect employees' rights, and promote equality in the workplace. Social dialogue mechanisms have been established to encourage cooperation among employers, workers, and the government, facilitating decision-making processes regarding labor legislation, economic policies, and institutional reforms.

However, despite the considerable achievements made in promoting inclusive economic growth, challenges and opportunities remain. One of the key challenges pertains to youth unemployment. Although Turkey’s overall unemployment rate has decreased in recent years, youthful unemployment rates have remained high. The government recognizes the importance of implementing youth entrepreneurship and skill development programs to provide young people with the necessary tools to enter the labor market successfully. Additionally, it has been working towards increasing labor force participation among women, as their participation rate remains relatively low compared to men. Encouraging women's participation in the workforce is seen as crucial for sustainable economic growth and societal development.

Another area that requires attention is the informal economy. While Turkey has made efforts to formalize informal economic activities and improve workers' access to social security, informal employment remains a challenge. Advancing formalization by enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of regulatory frameworks is paramount.

In conclusion, Turkey has shown its commitment to SDG 8 by implementing policies focusing on sustained and inclusive economic growth, productive employment, and decent work for all. The government has prioritized regional development, social protection, workplace safety, and gender equality to tackle the challenges hindering the achievement of the SDG targets. However, there is still work to be done, particularly in addressing youth unemployment and enhancing the formalization of the informal economy. Turkey will continue its efforts to uphold sustainable economic growth and ensure decent work for all of its citizens, demonstrating its dedication to sustainable development and contributing to the global SDG agenda.
