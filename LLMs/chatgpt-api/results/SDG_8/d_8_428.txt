Introduction
Malteser International’s Analytical Report on Sustainable Development Goal 8 – Decent Work and Economic Growth

1. Overview of SDG 8
Sustainable Development Goal 8 (SDG 8) seeks to promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all. It recognizes that economic growth must be inclusive and provide opportunities for everyone, leaving no one behind. In line with other SDGs, SDG 8 aims to address inequalities, reduce poverty, and enhance global prosperity.

2. Global trends and progress towards SDG 8
In recent years, the world has made commendable progress in some areas related to SDG 8. However, it is evident that challenges persist in attaining sustainable economic growth, inclusive employment, and decent work. A number of pressing issues affecting progress towards SDG 8 include:

2.1. Informal and precarious employment
A significant proportion of the global workforce remains employed in the informal sector, lacking job security, social protection, fair wages, and opportunities for skill development. Informal employment hinders sustainable economic growth and remains a persistent obstacle in achieving SDG 8. Additionally, emerging gig economy platforms and digital disruption have brought new challenges to traditional job markets.

2.2. Labour rights violations
Violations of fundamental labour rights, such as the right to organize and collectively bargain, continue to prevail in various parts of the world. Unfair working conditions, exploitation, and child labour are some of the unjust practices undermining SDG 8.

2.3. Gender inequality in the workforce
Gender disparities remain rampant in the global labour force, with women encountering numerous barriers to accessing decent work and economic opportunities. Persistent wage gaps, occupational segregation, and restrictive societal norms adversely affect women's participation, limiting the accomplishment of SDG 8.

2.4. Youth unemployment
High levels of youth unemployment exist in many countries, characterized by a lack of decent job opportunities for young people. Insufficient education and skills development fail to address the dynamic demands of the job market, leading to long-term adverse impacts on economic growth and social stability.

3. Innovations and best practices
To address these challenges and drive progress towards SDG 8, innovative approaches and best practices are emerging worldwide. Some notable initiatives include:

3.1. Social enterprises and impact investing
Social enterprises combine profit-making with social and environmental causes, aiming to create sustainable employment opportunities. Impact investing, which directs capital towards enterprises resolving social and environmental issues, plays a pivotal role in promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth.

3.2. Technological advancements and digital inclusion
Technological innovations have the potential to transform the job market positively. Digital inclusion initiatives, which ensure access to and training in technology for marginalized populations, help bridge the digital divide and enhance employability.

3.3. Skills development and education reform
Efforts to provide quality education and vocational training, aligning skillsets with market demands, prove instrumental in reducing unemployment rates and enhancing job prospects. Skills development policies should emphasize digital literacy, entrepreneurship, and adaptability to foster a resilient workforce.

4. Recommendations for advancing SDG 8
To accelerate progress towards SDG 8, the following recommendations are proposed:

4.1. Strengthen policy frameworks
Governments should enhance policy coherence by setting inclusive and sustainable development strategies. These frameworks should proactively address informal employment, labour rights violations, and gender inequalities to ensure the realization of decent work and economic growth goals.

4.2. Promote sustainable business practices
Businesses and employers must embrace sustainability principles, incorporating social and environmental considerations into their operations. Employers should be encouraged to adopt fair labour practices, provide equal opportunities, and ensure access to decent work for all.

4.3. Invest in education and training
Investments in education and vocational training should focus on equipping individuals with relevant skills to navigate the changing job landscape. Lifelong learning approaches should be promoted, building a skilled workforce resilient to emerging disruptions.

4.4. Mobilize adequate resources
Sustained investments in decent work, economic growth, and inclusive employment are critical to achieve SDG 8. Adequate resources should be mobilized from international development partners, private sector entities, and domestic budgets to support comprehensive and integrated interventions.

Conclusion
While progress has been made towards SDG 8, significant obstacles persist on the path to achieving inclusive economic growth and decent work for all. Governments, international organizations, businesses, and civil society must collaborate to address these challenges effectively. Innovative initiatives and targeted investments can play a crucial role in advancing this transformative goal, empowering individuals, eradicating poverty, reducing inequalities, and building a prosperous and sustainable future for all.
