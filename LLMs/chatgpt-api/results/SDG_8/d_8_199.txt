The Sustainable Development Goal 8 (SDG 8) aims to promote inclusive and sustained economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all. As an economist and a staunch advocate of a free-market economy, it is my aim to critically examine the implications and potential impact of SDG 8 on global economies.

Underneath the overarching goal of fostering sustained economic growth lies a number of specific targets. Firstly, SDG 8 seeks to achieve at least 7% annual economic growth in the least developed countries. This ambition is indeed admirable; however, it is worth considering whether imposing such a target is practical or even desirable. Economic growth is not something that can simply be mandated from the top down. It is a result of various factors, including innovation, entrepreneurial spirit, and investment. The path to sustainable economic growth lies through empowering individuals and businesses to pursue their own interests, rather than through the interventionist policies that the SDG appears to endorse.

Furthermore, SDG 8 acknowledges that a key component of economic growth is ensuring full and productive employment. While the goal of creating decent jobs is laudable, it is important to recognize that government intervention often hinders this process rather than facilitating it. Excessive regulation, burdensome taxes, and barriers to market entry all serve to stifle job creation and discourage entrepreneurship. It is vital, therefore, that any attempts to address decent work and employment issues prioritize the removal of these barriers and the promotion of free markets.

Another target of SDG 8 is to eradicate forced labor, modern slavery, and human trafficking by 2030. It goes without saying that these are all grave issues that demand our attention and effort. However, it is not clear that the goals as outlined in SDG 8 adequately address the root causes of these problems. This requires a broader understanding of the underlying dynamics that facilitate forced labor, such as weak rule of law, lack of economic opportunities, and distortions created by interventionist policies. By focusing on enabling institutions and a secure legal framework, we can effectively address these social maladies.

A final area of concern is target 8.6, which seeks to substantially reduce the proportion of youth not in employment, education, or training. This target is undoubtedly important considering the potential social and economic consequences of a large population of disengaged and marginalized youth. However, it is vital to recognize that education and training alone are not sufficient to address this challenge. While public initiatives aimed at boosting access to education can certainly be beneficial, it is only through economic growth and entrepreneurial opportunities that young people will truly be able to find stable employment and contribute to societal progress.

In conclusion, while the intentions behind SDG 8 are commendable, we must not lose sight of the importance of economic freedom and free markets in achieving sustainable economic growth, decent employment, and improved living standards for all. By adopting policies that empower individuals and businesses rather than hinder them, we can create an environment that fosters innovation, incentivizes productivity, and ensures that the goals envisaged by SDG 8 become a reality.
