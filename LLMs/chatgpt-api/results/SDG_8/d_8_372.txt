In recent years, the issue of promoting sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all has gained prominence on the global agenda. As an authoritative body working towards the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the International Organization for Migration (IOM) has closely monitored the progress made towards SDG 8—Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all. 

SDG 8 recognizes the critical importance of ensuring access to decent work opportunities for all individuals, as a means to eradicate poverty and reduce inequality. It highlights the need for equitable economic growth and the provision of decent jobs in order to enhance living standards and foster social cohesion. 

Over the past few years, remarkable progress has been made towards achieving SDG 8. Global economic growth has generally been positive, although significant challenges and disparities persist across regions and within countries. The World Bank projects a moderate increase in global GDP growth to 2.7% in 2017, followed by a slightly faster pace of 2.9% in 2018. 

Despite this positive growth trend, the global economy faces several challenges that require active attention and intervention. One pressing concern is the persistent high levels of unemployment, particularly among the youth. Globally, more than 201 million people were unemployed in 2017, and the International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates that the global unemployment rate will remain at around 5.7% in 2018.

Furthermore, the quality of employment is a critical aspect of SDG 8. Informal employment—often associated with low wages, lack of social protection, and limited access to rights—remains a significant issue in many countries. About 61.2% of the world's employed population is engaged in informal employment, with higher rates observed in developing regions.

Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that takes into account multiple dimensions of decent work, including efforts to ensure social protection, fair wages, safe working conditions, and equal opportunities for all. It also necessitates measures to promote entrepreneurship, innovation, and skill development, particularly in emerging sectors that have the potential to generate employment.

Migration plays a crucial role in shaping the labor markets and economies of both origin and destination countries. It is estimated that there were 258 million international migrants in 2017, and migration was linked to numerous economic and social opportunities.

Migration can both contribute to and hinder the achievement of SDG 8. On one hand, migrant workers often fill labor gaps in sectors where there is a shortage of local labor supply, contributing to economic growth and development of both their countries of destination and origin. Remittances sent by migrant workers are also a significant source of income for many households in developing countries.

On the other hand, migration can pose challenges to ensure decent work for migrants themselves. Irregular migration and human trafficking remain critical concerns, undermining the dignity and rights of migrant workers. Efforts towards effectively managing migration, ensuring regular pathways for migration, and addressing the drivers of irregular migration are imperative in promoting decent work for migrants.

To further advance SDG 8, it is essential to prioritize investment in education and skills training, improve labor market institutions, and foster inclusive economic growth. Additionally, adopting a rights-based approach to migration and recognizing the contribution of migrants to sustainable development would create an enabling environment for the achievement of decent work for all.

In conclusion, while progress has been made towards SDG 8, significant challenges persist in achieving sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all. A comprehensive and integrated approach that addresses the multiple dimensions of decent work, including migration-related issues, is necessary to reach these targets. The International Organization for Migration remains committed to working collaboratively with its partners towards achieving SDG 8 and ensuring a brighter future for generations to come.
