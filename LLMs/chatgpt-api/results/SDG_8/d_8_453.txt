INTRODUCTION

WaterAid: Analytical Report on Sustainable Development Goal 8

The purpose of this report is to provide a comprehensive analysis of Sustainable Development Goal 8 (SDG 8) from the perspective of WaterAid, a global nonprofit organization dedicated to providing clean water, sanitation, and hygiene services. This report is designed for an expert audience, including policymakers, researchers, and professionals in the field of development. Drawing upon our extensive expertise in water and sanitation, we aim to examine the progress made towards achieving the targets set under SDG 8 and identify key challenges and opportunities.

BACKGROUND

Goal 8, "Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all," acknowledges the crucial role that economic development plays in eradicating poverty and facilitating sustainable development. It recognizes the importance of inclusive growth, which benefits all members of society, without leaving anyone behind. Additionally, SDG 8 highlights the significance of productive employment and decent work in improving living standards and reducing inequalities.

KEY TARGETS AND INDICATORS

The targets under SDG 8 encompass various aspects of economic growth, employment, and decent work. To measure progress towards achieving these targets, we rely on a range of indicators, several of which intersect with WaterAid's particular focus on water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH):

1. Sustained economic growth:
   a. Indicator 8.1.1: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita growth rate

2. Productive employment:
   a. Indicator 8.2.1: Employment-to-population ratio
   b. Indicator 8.3.1: Youth not in education, employment, or training (NEET) rate

3. Decent work and equal pay:
   a. Indicator 8.5.1: Average hourly earnings of female and male employees

ANALYSIS OF PROGRESS

Overall, progress towards achieving SDG 8 has been mixed, with some notable advancements alongside persistent challenges.

1. Economic growth:
   While global GDP per capita has grown steadily over recent decades, this growth has not necessarily translated into improved living conditions for all. Regional disparities persist, with sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia lagging behind. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has severely hampered economic progress worldwide, exacerbating existing inequalities.

2. Productive employment:
   Employment opportunities have expanded over the years, exerting a significant impact on poverty reduction. However, the quality and stability of employment remain key concerns. Informal employment continues to prevail, leading to job insecurity, insufficient wages, and limited access to social protection systems. Moreover, global youth unemployment rates remain high, hindering their social and economic empowerment.

3. Decent work and equal pay:
   Despite efforts to promote gender equality, significant gender gaps persist in labor markets. Women continue to face wage discrimination, occupational segregation, and limited access to leadership positions. Achieving equal pay between women and men for work of equal value remains a challenge.

WATERAID'S CONTRIBUTIONS

WaterAid has been actively working towards contributing to the fulfillment of SDG 8. As an organization uniquely focused on water, sanitation, and hygiene, we recognize the critical role these factors play in economic growth, employment, and decent work:

1. Productivity and economic growth:
   Access to clean water and sanitation services are fundamental prerequisites for economic development. By providing safe water sources, adequate sanitation facilities, and promoting hygiene behaviors, WaterAid supports communities in harnessing their full economic potential.

2. Productive employment:
   Access to reliable water and sanitation facilities improves working circumstances, particularly for individuals engaged in agriculture, small-scale enterprises, and the informal sector. WaterAid's work directly aligns with SDG 8.2 by facilitating better health and productivity, leading to improved livelihood opportunities.

3. Decent work and inclusive employment:
   WaterAid acknowledges the importance of gender equality and social inclusion in promoting decent work for all. Our programs aim to address gender-based discrimination and socio-economic inequalities, ensuring equal opportunities and decent working conditions for everyone.

CONCLUSION

While progress towards SDG 8 has been uneven, efforts from organizations like WaterAid have contributed significantly to achieving the targets set under the goal. By recognizing the essential role of water, sanitation, and hygiene in economic growth, employment, and decent work, WaterAid has been actively addressing these interconnected challenges. However, more comprehensive, collaborative, and targeted actions are required on both national and global levels to fully attain the vision of SDG 8, ensuring inclusive and sustainable economic growth and decent work for all.
