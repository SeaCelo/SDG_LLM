Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)
Analytical Report on Sustainable Development Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

Introduction:

The pursuit of inclusive economic growth and decent work opportunities serves as the cornerstone of Sustainable Development Goal 8 (SDG 8). As an expert aid agency dedicated to promoting development, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) is committed to supporting countries in achieving these goals. This analysis provides an overview of the current progress towards SDG 8 in order to inform the work of policymakers, researchers, and development practitioners.

Global Status:

Although significant strides have been made in achieving economic growth and increasing employment, many countries continue to grapple with significant employment challenges, including high unemployment rates and inadequate working conditions. Globally, around 472 million individuals across all regions still faced open or vulnerable employment in 2020, impeding progress towards SDG 8. Moreover, these challenges have been exacerbated further due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, negatively impacting people's livelihoods and the overall labor market stability.

Challenges to Decent Work and Economic Growth:

1. Unemployment: The issue of unemployment persists globally, with the COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbating this challenge. The youth population is particularly vulnerable, as they face barriers in accessing employment opportunities due to limited skills, education, and experience.

2. Informal Economy: A vast number of workers remain engaged in the informal economy, subject to inadequate protection, low wages, and limited social security coverage. Addressing the issue of informal employment and facilitating this transition to the formal sector is crucial for achieving decent work and economic growth.

3. Gender Inequality: Gender disparities persist in labor market participation, with women being more likely to experience lower wages, discrimination, and a lack of access to quality employment. Closing the gender gaps in terms of employment rates, wages, and representation in decision-making positions is critical for sustainable development and achieving SDG 8.

4. Technological Advancements: While advancements in technology offer immense possibilities, they also pose significant challenges to the labor market. Automation and digitization could result in job displacement, particularly for workers in low-skilled or routine tasks. Balancing technological progress with the creation of new employment opportunities is crucial.

5. Environmental Sustainability: Economic growth and decent work need to be framed within the broader context of environmental sustainability. Efforts towards promoting sustainable consumption and production and adopting environmentally conscious practices must be integrated into the economic growth agenda.

JICA's Contribution:

JICA acknowledges the multifaceted nature of the challenges faced in realizing SDG 8 and remains committed to supporting partner countries in overcoming these impediments. The Japan Platform for Sustainable Growth aims to strengthen capacities, promote technological innovation, and enhance policy frameworks for sustaining decent work and economic growth.

Key Areas of JICA's Intervention:

1. Skill Development and Technical Training: JICA works closely with partner countries to foster skill development and enhance technical training programs. By providing vocational training and creating apprenticeship opportunities, JICA aims to bridge the skills gap and equip individuals with the necessary competencies to secure decent work.

2. Empowering Women and Promoting Gender Equality: JICA prioritizes gender-responsive approaches in its interventions, aiming to remove barriers that hinder women's participation in the labor force. JICA supports initiatives that facilitate access to employment, entrepreneurship opportunities, and leadership positions for women, promoting gender equality within and across sectors.

3. SME Development and Entrepreneurship Promotion: Recognizing the critical role of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in driving economic growth, JICA assists partner countries in fostering entrepreneurship and MSE development. By providing capacity-building support, financial resources, and market access, JICA encourages the growth and competitiveness of SMEs, leading to job creation and economic diversification.

4. Disaster Resilience and Job Creation: JICA integrates disaster risk reduction into the economic development agenda, recognizing the imperative of ensuring job security and sustainable livelihoods in vulnerable regions. Through infrastructure development, skills enhancement, and micro-enterprise support, JICA endeavors to strengthen economic resilience against natural disasters and reduce vulnerability to shocks.

Conclusion:

The achievement of SDG 8's objectives requires collaborative efforts, innovative solutions, and sustained commitment from governments, development partners, and relevant stakeholders. JICA, as a leading aid agency, remains steadfast in its support for partner countries' efforts to achieve decent work and economic growth. By focusing on skill development, gender empowerment, SME promotion, and resilience building, JICA contributes towards creating inclusive and sustainable economies that benefit all.
