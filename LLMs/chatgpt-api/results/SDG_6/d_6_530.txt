Water scarcity is a critical global challenge that undermines socio-economic development and poses a threat to human well-being and environmental sustainability. In recognition of this pressing issue, the international community adopted Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) in 2015, which aims to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all by 2030. This article, presented from the perspective of the American Economic Review of Insights, provides a comprehensive assessment of SDG 6 and identifies key areas that are essential for achieving its targets.

The first target of SDG 6 focuses on achieving universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all. In many developing countries, access to clean water remains a significant challenge, particularly for vulnerable populations in rural areas and informal settlements. Inadequate access to clean water not only poses a threat to public health but also exacerbates existing inequalities and hinders economic development. Economic interventions are crucial in addressing this issue by promoting investment in water infrastructure, improving water resource management, and creating financial mechanisms that ensure affordability and accessibility for all segments of society.

The second target of SDG 6 addresses the need to achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all. Poor sanitation practices and inadequate hygiene facilities are major contributors to disease outbreaks, particularly in resource-constrained settings. Sanitation interventions, such as the construction of improved sanitation facilities and the promotion of hygienic practices, are essential for reducing the burden of waterborne diseases and improving overall public health. Furthermore, economic analyses can help identify cost-effective approaches to sanitation provision, consider the social and cultural dimensions of behavior change, and highlight the potential economic benefits resulting from improved sanitation, including increased productivity and reduced healthcare costs.

Effective water resources management is a key cross-cutting issue in SDG 6. Access to clean water depends on sustainable management of water resources, particularly in the face of increasing water stress due to climate change, population growth, and economic development. Economic analysis can contribute to the implementation of sustainable water management strategies by assessing both the economic costs and benefits associated with various water resource management interventions. This includes evaluating the economic implications of alternative pricing mechanisms, promoting efficient allocation of water resources, and implementing integrated water resource management approaches that incorporate ecosystem services and promote water-use efficiency.

Another significant aspect of SDG 6 is the need to protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including rivers, lakes, and wetlands. Water-related ecosystems play a crucial role in regulating the quality and quantity of water resources, supporting biodiversity, and providing numerous ecosystem services that benefit both human well-being and economic activities. Economic appraisal can help identify the economic values associated with water-related ecosystems, including the provision of clean water, flood mitigation, and recreational opportunities. By incorporating these ecosystem values into decision-making processes, policymakers can better prioritize conservation efforts and devise incentives that encourage sustainable resource use.

The final target of SDG 6 emphasizes the need to support and strengthen international cooperation and capacity building for water and sanitation-related activities. While SDG 6 is a global agenda, addressing water and sanitation challenges requires a collaborative approach involving multiple stakeholders, including governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector. Economic analysis can play a key role in facilitating cooperation and capacity-building efforts by assessing the economic risks and benefits associated with international cooperation initiatives, evaluating the cost-effectiveness of development assistance programs, and identifying the institutional and governance mechanisms that promote effective coordination at various scales.

In conclusion, the achievement of SDG 6 requires a multidimensional and comprehensive approach that encompasses various socio-economic dimensions of water and sanitation. The economic perspective, as demonstrated in this article, is a vital tool for informing policy decisions, implementing cost-effective interventions, and understanding the wider implications of water and sanitation-related actions. By integrating economic concepts and insights into the implementation of SDG 6, a more sustainable and equitable approach to water and sanitation can be achieved, ultimately contributing to improved human well-being and environmental sustainability worldwide.
