Introduction:

This analytical report provides an in-depth overview and analysis of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6: Clean Water and Sanitation. Targeting an expert audience, this report has been prepared by the Afghan German Management College. The purpose of this report is to evaluate the current status and challenges faced in achieving SDG 6, highlight the initiatives undertaken, analyze progress, and provide recommendations to accelerate momentum towards this goal.

Analysis:

1. Current status of SDG 6 in Afghanistan:
Afghanistan faces significant challenges concerning clean water and sanitation. According to recent data, approximately 63% of the population lacks access to clean water sources, while about 70% lacks improved sanitation facilities. These statistics reveal the pressing need to address the water and sanitation crisis in the country.

2. Challenges:
a. Infrastructure and maintenance: The inadequacy of water supply systems and sanitation facilities poses a significant hurdle in achieving SDG 6 in Afghanistan. Insufficient infrastructure, lack of maintenance, and inadequate funding contribute to this challenge.

b. Sustainable management: Effective water resource management is crucial for achieving SDG 6. However, Afghanistan faces difficulties in water governance, including managing conflicts over water use, equitable distribution, and minimizing wastage.

c. Climate change and environmental degradation: Afghanistan suffers from the adverse effects of climate change, including prolonged droughts and recurring natural disasters. These factors further exacerbate challenges related to water availability and quality.

3. Initiatives and Progress:
Despite the challenges, several initiatives have been undertaken to achieve SDG 6 in Afghanistan.

a. Investments in water and sanitation: Various national and international organizations, including the Afghan government, have invested in projects aimed at improving access to clean water and sanitation. These initiatives include the construction of water supply systems, installation of sanitation facilities, and exploration of groundwater resources.

b. Policy reforms and legal frameworks: The Afghan government has introduced policy reforms and legal frameworks to enhance water resource management and address water and sanitation challenges. Examples include the creation of the National Water Law and the establishment of the National Water Affairs Regulation Authority.

c. Partnerships and coordination: Collaboration between government entities, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and international actors has played a crucial role in advancing SDG 6. Partnerships such as the Afghanistan Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Program, involving the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization (WHO), have contributed to the construction of water supply schemes and sanitation facilities.

4. Recommendations:
To accelerate progress towards SDG 6 in Afghanistan, the following recommendations can be considered:

a. Enhanced investment and financing: Increased financial resources should be allocated to water and sanitation infrastructure development and maintenance. This would involve securing greater funding from national, international, and private sources.

b. Strengthened institutions and governance: Efforts should be made to strengthen water governance institutions, ensuring coordination among relevant ministries and agencies. Adequate training and capacity-building programs should be initiated to enhance technical expertise.

c. Climate change resilience: Investment in climate change adaptation measures, such as rainwater harvesting systems and efficient irrigation techniques, can help mitigate the impact of changing climate patterns on water availability.

d. Public awareness and behavior change: Engaging communities through educational campaigns emphasizing the importance of clean water and sanitation can help foster behavior change and promote sustainable practices.

Conclusion:

SDG 6, which focuses on clean water and sanitation, remains a significant challenge in Afghanistan. Despite efforts by the government and international partners, many obstacles persist. However, through enhanced investments, strengthened institutions, climate change resilience measures, and focused awareness campaigns, progress towards SDG 6 can be accelerated. The Afghan German Management College is committed to continuing research and support in achieving SDG 6, ensuring sustainable access to clean water and sanitation for all Afghans.
