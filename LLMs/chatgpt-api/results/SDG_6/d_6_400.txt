The Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) focuses on ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. It aims to address the global water crisis and the lack of adequate sanitation, aiming to achieve universal access to safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services by 2030.

In this analytical report, we will examine the current status of SDG 6 implementation and provide an in-depth analysis based on the insights gathered by the Business Council for Peace (BCP). The BCP is a leading organization that promotes sustainable business practices and champions the role of the private sector in achieving the SDGs.

Access to clean water and sanitation remains a critical challenge, particularly in several developing regions and marginalized communities. While progress has been made, the current statistics highlight the need for immediate and sustained action. As of 2021, approximately 2.2 billion people globally lack access to safely managed drinking water, while 4.2 billion lack access to safely managed sanitation services. The scarcity of these essential resources not only exacerbates poverty, but also contributes to disease, gender inequality, and economic disparities.

BCP believes that the private sector plays a significant role in accelerating progress towards SDG 6. Collaboration between various stakeholders, including businesses, governments, civil society organizations, and local communities, is essential for attaining water and sanitation-related targets. The BCP encourages companies to integrate sustainability principles into their core business strategies and operations, recognizing the interconnectedness between water and sanitation, health, environment, and economic development.

Key Challenges and Opportunities:

1. Water scarcity and quality:

Water scarcity, exacerbated by climate change and population growth, is a pressing issue in many parts of the world. Furthermore, deteriorating water quality due to pollution from industrial activities and inadequate wastewater management poses substantial risks. To address these challenges, innovative technologies and water management practices need to be adopted across sectors, emphasizing water efficiency, recycling, and conservation.

2. Sanitation and hygiene:

Improving sanitation and hygiene practices is crucial for preventing diseases and enhancing overall well-being. The private sector can contribute by developing affordable and sustainable sanitation solutions, advancing wastewater treatment technologies, and supporting education programs to promote proper handwashing and hygiene practices.

3. Financing and investment:

Significant investment is required to achieve SDG 6 targets. The BCP believes that the private sector can mobilize investment by aligning business strategies with sustainable development objectives, engaging in public-private partnerships, and leverage financing mechanisms like impact investing and green bonds. Financial institutions can also play a crucial role in supporting water and sanitation projects through responsible investment practices and innovative funding models.

4. Gender equality:

Women and girls are disproportionately affected by water scarcity and lack of sanitation, often bearing the burden of water collection, jeopardizing their health, education, and economic opportunities. Companies can promote gender equality by actively engaging and investing in initiatives that improve WASH access, alleviate the burden on women, and empower local communities.

5. Data collection and monitoring:

Accurate and timely data collection is essential for tracking progress, identifying gaps, and evaluating impact. The private sector can support data collection and monitoring efforts by leveraging technology, implementing remote sensing techniques, and collaborating with governments and non-governmental organizations to ensure reliable and up-to-date data on water resources, access, and quality.

Conclusion:

SDG 6 addresses fundamental challenges affecting billions of people worldwide and calls for collective action. The powerful role of the private sector cannot be understated in achieving universal access to water and sanitation. The Business Council for Peace encourages companies to adopt sustainable practices, innovate solutions, and commit to long-term partnerships that prioritize water and sanitation, benefiting communities, the environment, and businesses themselves. Through collective efforts, it is both realistic and possible to realize a future where everyone has access to clean water and sanitation.
