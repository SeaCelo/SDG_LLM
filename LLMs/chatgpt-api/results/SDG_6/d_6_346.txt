Humanity relies heavily on water for essential activities such as drinking and sanitation, agriculture, and industry. However, access to clean water and appropriate sanitation facilities remains a challenge for millions of people worldwide. The Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6), established by the United Nations, addresses this urgent need and aims to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all by 2030.

As the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID), it is crucial for us to analyze the progress made towards achieving SDG 6 and identify potential areas for improvement. Therefore, this analytical report will delve into the current state of SDG 6, highlighting the successes, challenges, and recommendations within Spain and globally.

In Spain, access to clean water is generally high, with a remarkable 99.4% of households having access to improved drinking water sources. Furthermore, the country has made considerable efforts to provide sanitation facilities to its citizens, resulting in a 98% coverage rate for improved sanitation.

Spain has actively promoted water conservation, efficient water use, and the protection of water ecosystems through various legislation, such as the National Water Pact, the Water Framework Directive, and the National Plan for Irrigation Modernization. These initiatives have contributed to improved water governance and the sustainable management of water resources within the country.

However, challenges still exist, primarily in ensuring equitable access to water and sanitation services among vulnerable populations, including rural communities and migrants. Furthermore, water scarcity is increasing in certain regions due to climate change and population growth, requiring enhanced water efficiency measures and innovative approaches to water resource management.

While implementing SDG 6 domestically, AECID has been extensively involved in supporting global efforts towards water and sanitation. This agency has funded multiple projects in developing countries, with a focus on promoting access to clean water, improving sanitation facilities, and enhancing water governance.

Despite the significant progress made worldwide, water scarcity remains a pressing issue, particularly in developing regions. Around 2.2 billion people globally still lack access to safely managed drinking water services, and 4.2 billion people lack safely managed sanitation facilities. This disparity is especially evident in sub-Saharan Africa, where limited access to water and sanitation hampers socio-economic development and exacerbates poverty.

To address these challenges, it is vital to prioritize water-related investments in infrastructure, capacity-building, and technological advancements. This means increasing funding from both domestic and international sources and fostering partnerships to leverage resources and expertise.

Furthermore, promoting integrated water resource management is essential to balance competing demands and ensure water sustainability for future generations. This includes investing in watershed protection, water recycling, and efficient irrigation methods.

Advancements in research and innovation can also play a significant role in finding efficient and cost-effective solutions to water-related challenges. Encouraging collaboration between governments, academia, NGOs, and private companies will facilitate knowledge-sharing and the development of innovative technologies.

AECID, in collaboration with other stakeholders, should continue to prioritize the allocation of resources towards projects aimed at improving water and sanitation access, especially in countries facing the greatest challenges. This includes supporting capacity-building initiatives, strengthening local institutions, and engaging communities to ensure the sustainability of interventions.

In conclusion, while considerable progress has been made towards achieving SDG 6, there is still much work to be done. Spain, through its commitment to water management and AECID's efforts in supporting global initiatives, can play a pivotal role in advancing the access to clean water and sanitation for all. By addressing the challenges, adopting innovative approaches, and nurturing partnerships, we can contribute to ensuring a sustainable future where everyone can enjoy their basic human right to water and sanitation.
