Clean Water and Sanitation: A Commitment towards Sustainable Development

Water - the essence of life - is a resource that empowers societies and propels economies. It is the foundation of agriculture, industry, and human health. Yet, in a world where natural resources are abundant, over 2 billion people still lack access to clean water and sanitation. It is for this reason that the United Nations, in collaboration with its member states, formulated Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6): ensuring clean water and sanitation for all. At Fortune, we recognize the significance of this goal in reshaping our world. Here, we delve into the key aspects of SDG 6 to explore its groundbreaking potential and the steps being taken towards achieving it.

Access to clean water is a basic human right, and yet, it remains elusive for large populations across the globe. Insufficient water supply and poor sanitation practices have severe repercussions on health, education, and economic productivity. Children bear the brunt of this crisis, as numerous diseases such as diarrhea, cholera, and dysentery result from consuming contaminated water. In fact, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 297,000 children under the age of five die each year due to waterborne diseases. Building resilient and sustainable water infrastructure while ensuring sanitation facilities for all is crucial in addressing this urgent challenge.

One of the key targets of SDG 6 is achieving universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030. This ambitious objective demands coordinated efforts between governments, civil society organizations, and the private sector. Innovative solutions are being embraced worldwide to provide access to clean water, even in the most remote regions. For instance, proactive governments are investing in rainwater harvesting systems and groundwater recharge initiatives. Similarly, technological advancements such as solar-powered filtration systems and low-energy water purification technologies are game-changers for water-stricken areas.

Open defecation, a pressing issue closely tied to the lack of clean water and sanitation, adversely impacts public health and the environment. SDG 6 seeks to achieve universal access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all, emphasizing the importance of proper waste management and the construction of separate facilities for women and girls. This target requires a comprehensive paradigm shift where governments prioritize sanitation services, encourage behavioral change, and integrate safe hygiene practices into educational curricula.

To achieve these objectives, finance plays a critical role. According to a report by the World Bank, meeting SDG 6 requirements implies an enormous financial burden. In fact, estimated global investments reaching up to $6.7 trillion annually by 2030 are needed. The private sector is a powerful force driving sustainable development, and companies are starting to recognize the importance of providing water and sanitation services while retaining a bottom-line focus. By engaging in partnerships with communities and governments, corporations have an opportunity to enact high-impact change and contribute towards achieving SDG 6.

An excellent example of private sector commitment is demonstrated by Nestl√© Waters' Creating Shared Value initiative. The company aims to enhance water and sanitation services in water-stressed regions and has collaborated with local communities and governments to implement various projects. Similarly, Unilever's Domestos brand has partnered with UNICEF to eliminate open defecation by promoting the concept of household toilets in disadvantaged communities.

The scale and complexity of SDG 6 demand innovative approaches from diverse stakeholders. Multilateral organizations, such as the World Bank and UN-Water, coordinate efforts to mobilize resources and elevate the profile of water and sanitation on national agendas. Civil society organizations and NGOs play a crucial role as well, working tirelessly to raise awareness, improve water governance, and empower communities with the knowledge needed to construct resilient water systems.

With a decade remaining to fulfill the SDGs, it is imperative that countries expedite progress towards achieving SDG 6. Transformations at various levels are required, from systemic changes in education and policy frameworks to pragmatic solutions embracing the latest technologies. Clean water and sanitation underpin human well-being and lay the foundation for sustainable development and thriving economies. It is a collective responsibility to ensure that no one is left behind in this global commitment.

Fortune magazine applauds the unwavering efforts of governments, NGOs, and corporations in using their influence and resources to tackle the water and sanitation crisis. By joining hands, we can make SDG 6 a reality. As we celebrate innovative breakthroughs and innovative collaborations, let us remember that the journey to clean water and sanitation for all is not just a moral imperative; it is an essential stride towards a prosperous, equitable, and sustainable world.
