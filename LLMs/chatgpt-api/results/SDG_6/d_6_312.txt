Introduction
Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) aims to "ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all". This report, prepared by the Agência Brasileira de Cooperação (ABC), provides a detailed analysis of the current state of SDG 6, focusing on the progress, challenges, and opportunities for achieving the goal. Targeting an expert audience, this report will comprehensively examine key issues and provide recommendations to inform future actions.

Overview of SDG 6
SDG 6 tackles the global water and sanitation crisis, recognizing that water and sanitation are essential for human well-being, health, and sustainable development. The target for SDG 6 is to achieve universal and equitable access to safe drinking water, adequate sanitation, and hygiene for all by 2030.

Progress Towards SDG 6
Significant progress has been achieved since the adoption of the SDGs in 2015. The number of people without access to basic sanitation services has declined globally, from 2.4 billion in 2015 to 2 billion in 2019. Similarly, more people now have access to improved drinking water sources, with 90% of the global population enjoying such access. These improvements signify considerable efforts made by governments, organizations, and communities in expanding water and sanitation services.

Challenges Facing SDG 6
Despite the progress, several challenges hinder the full realization of SDG 6. Firstly, regional disparities persist, with rural areas and marginalized populations still having limited access to safe water and sanitation services. Additionally, climate change exacerbates water scarcity in many regions, threatening water availability for communities and ecosystems alike. Lack of financial resources, inadequate infrastructure, and inadequate institutional capacity also pose hurdles for achieving SDG 6 at scale.

Opportunities for Advancement
To overcome the challenges faced by SDG 6, it is crucial to harness available opportunities. Investment in water and sanitation infrastructure will play a key role in ensuring sustainable access. Strengthening multi-stakeholder partnerships, including collaboration with the private sector, can generate innovative and scalable solutions. Embracing new technologies such as water recycling, smart water management systems, and sanitation innovations can significantly improve service delivery and efficiency.

Integrating SDG 6 with Other Goals
SDG 6 is inherently interconnected with other SDGs, particularly SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 5 (Gender Equality), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and SDG 13 (Climate Action). Addressing water and sanitation challenges can positively impact health outcomes, empower women, improve urban resilience, and enhance climate adaptation and mitigation efforts. Strengthening coordination and collaboration between sectors is vital for synergistic progress.

Recommendations for Action
Several strategic actions must be taken to accelerate progress towards SDG 6. Firstly, governments and international organizations should prioritize water and sanitation within national development agendas and allocate adequate financial resources for infrastructure development and capacity building. Additionally, the importance of community engagement, particularly women's participation, should be recognized in decision-making processes focused on water and sanitation management.

Investing in research and innovation, including the development and adoption of sustainable and cost-effective technologies, can lead to transformative advancements in the water and sanitation sector. Furthermore, effective monitoring and data collection systems are required to track progress, monitor service delivery, and identify areas that necessitate intervention.

Conclusion
The successful achievement of SDG 6 encompasses the realization of universal access to safe drinking water, adequate sanitation, and hygienic conditions. While progress has been made, challenges still persist, necessitating robust efforts and collaboration from governments, organizations, and communities. By embracing the recommended actions, prioritizing integration with other SDGs, and embracing opportunities, SDG 6 can be realized, ensuring sustainable water and sanitation for all, ultimately contributing to a more equitable and resilient world.
