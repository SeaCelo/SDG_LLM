Analytical Report on Sustainable Development Goal 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all

Executive summary

This analytical report focuses on the current status of Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) in Palestine. The goal, which pertains to ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, is of crucial importance in Palestine, as it faces several challenges in these areas. As the Palestinian International Cooperative Agency (PICA), our aim is to assess the progress made towards achieving SDG 6, identify the existing gaps, and recommend strategies for improvement. This report is primarily intended for an expert audience familiar with SDG implementation and the specific issues that persist in Palestine.

Introduction

Access to clean water and proper sanitation facilities is a fundamental human right, yet it remains a significant challenge in Palestine. The occupation and political situation have severely hindered the ability of Palestinians to secure a sustainable and reliable water supply, as well as adequate sanitation services. Consequently, achieving SDG 6 in Palestine demands concerted efforts from national and international stakeholders.

Current Status and Challenges

Water availability and quality: Palestine suffers from scarce freshwater resources due to various factors, including overexploitation, climate change, and Israeli water policies. Currently, the per capita domestic water consumption is considerably below international standards, with stark disparities between Gaza and the West Bank. Additionally, around 25% of Palestinian households are forced to rely on partially treated water, contaminated due to inadequate infrastructure and the presence of pollutants. Efforts to optimize water use efficiency and develop alternative water sources, such as rainwater harvesting and wastewater reuse, have faced challenges due to financial constraints, limited technical expertise, and restrictions imposed by the occupation.

Sanitation services: Access to improved sanitation facilities remains inadequate, particularly in marginalized areas of Palestine. The population growth, restrictive policies, and lack of funding have curtailed progress. Currently, around 17% of the population in the West Bank and a staggering 83% of Gaza's population rely on septic tanks or cesspits, leading to improper waste management, groundwater contamination, and public health risks. In addition, the lack of wastewater treatment facilities exacerbates the health and environmental impact. The blockade imposed in Gaza has significantly hampered the development and maintenance of infrastructure, exacerbating the sanitation crisis in the region.

Institutional capacity and coordination: In order to address these challenges, it is crucial to strengthen the institutional capacity and coordination among relevant authorities. Currently, there exists fragmentation in policies, inconsistent regulation enforcement, and inadequately trained technical personnel. This hampers comprehensive planning, monitoring, and governance efforts. Enhanced coordination and cooperation between governmental bodies, civil society organizations, and international actors are essential for promoting sustainable water and sanitation practices.

Progress and Initiatives

Despite the obstacles, Palestine has made notable progress towards achieving SDG 6. Efforts have been made to enhance awareness and advocacy for sustainable water management and sanitation practices through national campaigns and community mobilization initiatives. Several organizations, including PICA, have played an active role in supporting infrastructure development projects, capacity building, and knowledge sharing to address the water and sanitation challenges in Palestine.

Additionally, programs focusing on rainwater harvesting, wastewater treatment, and improving access to safe water in marginalized communities have been implemented. International cooperation has played a pivotal role in facilitating technical assistance, funding, and technology transfer.

Recommendations

To advance the achievement of SDG 6 in Palestine, several recommendations are put forth:

1. Capacity building and technical expertise: Strengthen training programs and capacity-building initiatives for water and sanitation practitioners, with a focus on promoting integrated water resources management, water demand management, and sustainable sanitation practices.

2. Sustainable infrastructure development: Prioritize investments in the development and maintenance of water supply and sanitation infrastructure, drawing upon sustainable and environmentally friendly practices. Emphasize public-private partnerships and seek international financial assistance to overcome the financial constraints.

3. Policy reform and governance: Enhance regulations and policy frameworks to enforce water and sanitation standards across Palestine. Develop a comprehensive national strategy on water and sanitation, harmonizing efforts across regional and national authorities. Improve coordination between relevant actors and ensure greater transparency and accountability.

4. Advocacy and public awareness: Strengthen public awareness campaigns on responsible water consumption, environmental conservation, and proper sanitation practices. This could be achieved through collaborations with media, education institutions, and civil society organizations.

5. International support and diplomatic efforts: Leverage international partnerships to garner political, financial, and technical support for achieving SDG 6 in Palestine. Encourage diplomatic efforts to end the restrictions imposed by the occupation, particularly regarding water resources management and infrastructure development.

Conclusion

SDG 6 necessitates urgent action to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all in Palestine. Despite the significant challenges posed by the occupation and a constrained resource base, notable progress has been made. By focusing on capacity building, infrastructure development, policy reform, advocacy, and international support, Palestinian stakeholders, along with the support of international partners, can take strides towards achieving SDG 6 and improving the lives of Palestinians by ensuring access to clean water and adequate sanitation services for all.
