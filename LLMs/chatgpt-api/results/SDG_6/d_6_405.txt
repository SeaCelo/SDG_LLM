Introduction:
This analytical report provides an in-depth analysis of Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6): Clean Water and Sanitation. The report is authored by the Center for Victims of Torture (CVT) and is targeted towards an expert audience interested in understanding the current status, challenges, and opportunities related to SDG 6 implementation.

Executive Summary:
SDG 6 aims to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all by 2030. Despite notable progress, significant gaps persist, particularly in regions affected by conflict, violence, and torture. The report highlights the impact of torture on clean water and sanitation access, examines the barriers faced by torture survivors, and proposes potential solutions to address these challenges.

Main Body:

1. Overview of SDG 6:
SDG 6 primarily focuses on achieving universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water, adequate sanitation, and hygiene for all. It recognizes the fundamental importance of water and sanitation in combating poverty, ensuring good health, and promoting sustainable development.

2. Impact of Torture on Water and Sanitation:
Torture has severe physical, psychological, and social consequences on survivors, affecting their ability to fulfill their basic needs. Clean water and sanitation, a human right, becomes compromised due to the trauma experienced during torture. Torture survivors may face physical limitations, anxiety, and fear that hinder their ability to access water and sanitation facilities.

3. Barriers in Access to Clean Water and Sanitation for Torture Survivors:
a) Physical Accessibility: Many water and sanitation facilities lack necessary adaptations for survivors with disabilities or limited mobility.
b) Mental Health Challenges: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other psychological conditions resulting from torture pose obstacles in utilizing public amenities due to anxiety, fear of confinement, or triggering physical sensations.
c) Stigma and Discrimination: Discrimination against torture survivors by community members or service providers affects their ability to access clean water and sanitation without fear of judgment or backlash.
d) Forced Displacement: Torture survivors are often forced to flee their homes, leading to a loss of regular access to water and sanitation facilities.

4. Opportunities for Addressing Challenges:
a) Sensitization of Service Providers: Training programs for water and sanitation service providers can help increase their understanding of the needs and triggers associated with torture survivors. This promotes a more accommodating and empathetic environment for survivors.
b) Psychosocial Support: Integrating trauma-informed care into water and sanitation provision, such as providing counseling services at facilities, can help survivors overcome mental health challenges and access essential resources.
c) Accessibility Adaptations: Taking measures to make water and sanitation facilities physically accessible, including ramps, handrails, and adaptive equipment, supports survivors with disabilities or limited mobility.
d) Community Engagement: Creating awareness campaigns to challenge societal stigma and promote inclusion and acceptance of torture survivors can contribute to an enabling environment for their access to water and sanitation.

Conclusion:
SDG 6 aims to ensure universal access to clean water and safely managed sanitation facilities. However, the impact of torture on survivors hinders their access to these essential services. By addressing the barriers faced by torture survivors through accommodations, sensitization, and community engagement, we can create an environment where all individuals, including survivors, can exercise their right to clean water and adequate sanitation. The provision of such services contributes not only to SDG 6 but also to the broader goal of sustainable development and human dignity. It requires collaborative efforts from governments, NGOs, and society as a whole to effectively address this complex issue in a comprehensive and inclusive manner.
