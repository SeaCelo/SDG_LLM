Water is an indispensable resource for human well-being, socio-economic development, and the environment. The importance of ensuring access to clean water and sanitation for all is widely recognized, and it has been reflected in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations in 2015. SDG 6 specifically addresses this issue, aiming to "ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all" by 2030.

Water scarcity and polluted water sources are global challenges that have adverse effects on human health, ecosystems, and economic prosperity. The World Bank estimates that by 2050, 45% of the global population will be living in areas with limited access to clean water. Moreover, around 2 billion people currently lack access to safe drinking water, and 4.2 billion people do not have adequate sanitation facilities. These dramatic numbers highlight the urgency of achieving SDG 6.

A holistic approach is necessary to address the complexity of SDG 6 and its interlinkages with other SDGs. Water management involves not only providing access to clean water but also ensuring water sustainability, efficient use of water resources, and the protection and restoration of aquatic ecosystems. Integrated water resources management (IWRM) is a key principle underlying SDG 6, emphasizing the need for coordinated action across sectors such as agriculture, industry, and energy to achieve water security.

Accounting and economics play vital roles in advancing SDG 6. By providing frameworks, tools, and methodologies, they can assist governments, organizations, and stakeholders in assessing progress, addressing challenges, and making informed decisions about water management. Accounting practices enable tracking and measurement of water-related costs and benefits, promoting accountability and transparency. Furthermore, economic analysis can help optimize water allocation, quantify the value of water, and identify efficient solutions for water-related challenges.

One area where accounting and economics can contribute to SDG 6 is in the management of water pricing and financing mechanisms. Water pricing plays a crucial role in incentivizing efficient water use, reducing waste, and promoting investment in water infrastructure. By aligning pricing with the true value of water, accounting principles can facilitate the setting of fair and effective tariff structures. Economic analysis can aid in determining optimal pricing strategies that balance affordability and sustainability, accounting for externalities such as environmental and health costs.

Another aspect where accounting can assist in achieving SDG 6 is through the development and implementation of water accounting systems. Water accounting provides a comprehensive framework for measuring, monitoring, and reporting water-related information. It enables the assessment of water availability, quality, and use, as well as the identification of potential risks and opportunities. By integrating water-related data into financial statements and sustainability reports, organizations can enhance their accountability and disclosure practices, making their water management efforts more transparent and accountable to stakeholders.

To realize the vision of SDG 6, collaboration and partnerships are essential. Governments, businesses, civil society organizations, and academia should work together to mobilize resources, share knowledge, and pool expertise. Accounting and economics can act as catalysts in fostering multi-stakeholder partnerships by providing insights on the financial viability of water-related initiatives, estimating the economic benefits of water investments, and identifying potential funding sources.

In conclusion, SDG 6 calls for collective action to ensure access to clean water and sanitation for all. Accounting and economics can make significant contributions to realizing this goal by providing frameworks, tools, and economic analysis that support informed decision-making, enhance accountability, and facilitate efficient water management. By leveraging the expertise and leveraging partnerships across sectors, we can pave the way towards a more sustainable and resilient water future.
