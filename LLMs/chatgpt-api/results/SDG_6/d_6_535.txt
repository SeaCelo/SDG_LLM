Water is one of the most fundamental resources for sustaining life, supporting various economic activities, and ensuring the development of societies. However, in many parts of the world, access to safe and clean water remains a challenge. As a result, the United Nations has identified the need for a dedicated Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) to address this issue. SDG 6 aims to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. This article will explore the various dimensions, challenges, and potential solutions related to SDG 6, in line with the research focus of The World Bank Economic Review.

One of the key objectives of SDG 6 is to provide universal access to safe and affordable drinking water. Despite progress in this area, billions of people still lack access to clean water sources. This has wide-ranging implications for health, education, and overall socio-economic development. Ensuring the availability of safe water sources requires investment in infrastructure, access to water treatment technologies, and institutional frameworks to govern its distribution. The World Bank, with its diverse portfolio of projects in developing countries, has been instrumental in driving initiatives to achieve universal access to safe drinking water.

Another aspect of SDG 6 is the goal to achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all. Improved sanitation facilities, including access to toilets and proper waste management practices, are essential to promoting public health and dignity. More than 4.5 billion people globally lack access to appropriate sanitation facilities, leading to the spread of diseases and environmental degradation. The World Bank has been actively involved in supporting countries in developing effective strategies and policies to improve sanitation facilities and promote hygiene practices. These efforts have shown remarkable success in areas such as South Asia, where access to toilets has been significantly increased through community-led initiatives.

To achieve SDG 6, addressing the issue of water scarcity is crucial. Climate change and population growth are putting increasing pressure on water resources, leading to water stress and scarcity in many regions. This has far-reaching effects on agricultural productivity, food security, and socio-economic development. The World Bank has been at the forefront of promoting water resource management practices, such as rainwater harvesting, groundwater recharge, and water use efficiency, to ensure sustainable water supply in a changing climate. These measures have not only helped secure water availability but have also contributed to the overall resilience of communities and economies.

Water pollution is another significant challenge that needs to be addressed under SDG 6. Unregulated discharge of untreated wastewater and industrial effluents into water bodies has severe ecological and health implications. Contaminated water sources pose risks to human health, ecosystems, and the overall sustainability of water resources. The World Bank has been actively engaged in supporting wastewater management programs, promoting eco-friendly industries, and strengthening regulatory frameworks to minimize pollution and protect water quality. These initiatives have proved successful in restoring the health of polluted water bodies and promoting sustainable industrial practices.

Furthermore, achieving SDG 6 requires strong institutional capacity and cooperation at all levels. Building the necessary infrastructure, developing efficient governance mechanisms, and promoting integrated water resource management are essential elements of this goal. The World Bank has been instrumental in providing technical assistance, financial support, and knowledge-sharing platforms to assist countries in strengthening their water and sanitation sectors. Collaborative efforts among governments, civil society, and the private sector are vital for long-term sustainability and achieving the objectives of SDG 6.

In conclusion, SDG 6 serves as a crucial framework for addressing the challenges associated with water and sanitation globally. The World Bank's involvement in supporting initiatives related to this goal highlights the significance of water and sanitation for sustainable development. Through investing in infrastructure, promoting equitable access, mitigating water scarcity, addressing pollution, and developing institutional capacity, SDG 6 provides a roadmap for a water-secure and sustainable future. It is in the interest of both developed and developing nations to work collectively towards achieving SDG 6, as the access to clean water and sanitation underpins numerous socioeconomic development benefits for all.
