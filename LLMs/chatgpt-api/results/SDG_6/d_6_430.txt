In recent years, the global community has come together in an unprecedented effort to tackle one of the most pressing challenges of our time - achieving universal access to clean water and sanitation. Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6), aptly named "Clean Water and Sanitation" was developed by the United Nations to address this urgent matter and ensure that every person, regardless of their location, enjoys access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation facilities by the year 2030.

As a leading international medical humanitarian organization, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has been at the forefront of providing healthcare in some of the most challenging environments around the world. With our extensive experience in both emergency response and longer-term projects, we have a unique insight into the various aspects of SDG 6 and the obstacles that hinder its achievement.

One of the primary challenges faced in achieving SDG 6 is the widespread lack of access to basic water and sanitation services in many regions, particularly in low-income countries and areas affected by conflicts and natural disasters. These circumstances lead to dire consequences for the most vulnerable populations, including increased transmission of water-borne diseases, malnutrition, and even death. It is, therefore, imperative to prioritize these areas and ensure their inclusion in national and regional development plans.

Equity and inclusion are paramount to the success of SDG 6. We must address the existing disparities in the provision of clean water and sanitation services among different social groups, including rural versus urban populations, indigenous communities, and marginalized individuals. Tailored solutions must be implemented to ensure that nobody is left behind in the pursuit of this goal. Moreover, efforts should be made to empower and involve these communities in the decision-making processes related to water services, sanitation infrastructure, and waste management.

Additionally, there is a critical need for innovation and investment in water and sanitation technologies. In many of the communities we work in, water sources are scarce or contaminated, posing significant health risks. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop and implement sustainable solutions to ensure access to safe water, such as rainwater harvesting systems, water treatment methods suited to local conditions, and the improvement of water supply infrastructure, particularly in rural areas.

Sanitation is another crucial component of SDG 6. Accessible and safely managed sanitation facilities are vital for preventing the spread of diseases and maintaining a healthy living environment. We must tackle the problem of open defecation, which affects billions of people worldwide and leads to the contamination of water sources, increased vulnerability to hygiene-related diseases, and pollution of the environment. Encouraging the use of innovative and cost-effective sanitation technologies, investing in comprehensive waste management systems, and promoting effective hygiene practices are crucial steps towards achieving this target.

Field experiences and evidence-based research have repeatedly shown that integrated approaches, which focus on partnerships and collaboration between government authorities, civil society organizations, affected communities, and other stakeholders, are the most effective means of achieving lasting change. Coordination and cooperation at all levels are key to overcoming the disparities and challenges in different parts of the world.

Furthermore, crisis situations such as conflicts, protracted displacement, and natural disasters exacerbate the already critical water and sanitation challenges. SDG 6 must align with emergency response strategies to ensure that affected populations have access to immediate life-saving assistance, such as clean water supply, hygiene kits, and adequate sanitation facilities. This requires flexible and adaptable programs that can respond swiftly to emergencies and engage in early recovery efforts to mitigate the impact of disasters on water and sanitation infrastructure.

In conclusion, achieving SDG 6 is a formidable task that requires collective action, sustained commitment, and innovative solutions. Addressing the disparities in access to clean water and sanitation, empowering marginalized communities, promoting hygiene education, and collaborating across sectors are essential steps towards reaching this goal. Médecins Sans Frontières remains committed to playing an active role in this crucial endeavor, leveraging our expertise and experience in responding to humanitarian crises and working towards sustainable and equitable solutions for all. Together, we can make clean water and sanitation a reality for every person on this planet.
