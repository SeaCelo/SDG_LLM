Introduction:

SDG 6 aims to achieve universal and equitable access to safe drinking water, adequate sanitation, and hygiene for all by 2030. Clean water and proper sanitation are vital for human health, sustainable development, and the reduction of poverty. However, this target is far from being reached for many communities around the world.

Section 1: Current Progress and Challenges

This section provides a comprehensive analysis of the ongoing progress and challenges within the context of SDG 6.
