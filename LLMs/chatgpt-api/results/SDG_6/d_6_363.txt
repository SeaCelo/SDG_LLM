1. Introduction

Water scarcity is a pressing global issue that has far-reaching impacts on economies, livelihoods, and the environment. Access to clean water and sanitation is fundamental for human development and a key component of sustainable development. One of the seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), SDG 6 focuses on ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.

This analytical report, prepared by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), aims to provide an expert audience with an in-depth analysis of the current state of SDG 6 implementation and the challenges that remain. It also offers strategic recommendations to accelerate progress towards achieving universal access to clean water and sanitation by 2030.

2. Current progress towards SDG 6

Despite some positive advancements in improving access to water and sanitation globally, significant challenges persist. According to the latest data, approximately 2.2 billion people still lack access to safely managed drinking water and 4.2 billion people lack access to safely managed sanitation services. Furthermore, a high proportion of these individuals reside in low- and middle-income countries.

In many regions, water scarcity and unreliable water supply contribute to increased health risks and productivity losses. Moreover, populations affected by poverty, conflict, and gender inequality face additional barriers that hinder their ability to access adequate water and sanitation services.

3. Leveraging financing for sustainable water management

Achieving SDG 6 requires substantial investments in infrastructure, water resource management, and integrated approaches to water governance. The EBRD recognizes the importance of leveraging finance and promoting a sustainable and inclusive water sector development. Public-private partnerships (PPPs), blended finance models, and innovative financing mechanisms are crucial tools for mobilizing funds, especially in areas where public resources are limited.

The EBRD, through its Sustainable Municipal Infrastructure Facility (SMIF) and its Green Economy Transition (GET) approach, has prioritized sustainable investments in the water sector. Building on its successful track record, the bank continues to offer financial products that address specific water-related challenges while advancing the overarching goals of SDG 6.

4. Addressing climate change and water-related risks

One of the key challenges affecting water and sanitation services is climate change. Rising global temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and extreme weather events pose significant threats to water resources and infrastructure. These risks are expected to intensify in the future, negatively impacting regions that are already vulnerable.

To address these challenges, the EBRD advocates for incorporating climate change adaptation strategies and resilience-building measures into water management practices. This includes investing in climate-resilient infrastructure, enhancing water use efficiency, promoting nature-based solutions, and facilitating knowledge sharing on innovative technologies and best practices.

5. Promoting gender equality and social inclusion

SDG 6 emphasizes the importance of equitable access to water and sanitation services. Gender inequalities persist in many societies, with women and girls disproportionately affected by the lack of access to clean water and proper sanitation facilities. They often bear the burden of water collection and sanitation-related responsibilities, which can hinder their ability to engage in productive activities, pursue education, and participate fully in society.

Addressing gender disparities and ensuring social inclusion requires targeted interventions and policies that empower women and vulnerable groups. Through its gender inclusion initiatives, the EBRD promotes gender mainstreaming in its water sector projects, encouraging equitable water distribution and supporting women's entrepreneurship and leadership in the water sector.

6. Conclusion and recommendations

While progress has been made towards achieving SDG 6, it is evident that additional efforts and strategic interventions are necessary to overcome the remaining challenges. The EBRD encourages a comprehensive approach that combines increased financing, climate change resilience, gender and social inclusion, and regional cooperation to accelerate progress towards SDG 6 targets.

To enhance implementation, the EBRD recommends the following actions:

a) Scaling up investments in water infrastructure, particularly in areas with limited access to safe water and sanitation services.
b) Enhancing regional collaboration and knowledge sharing to address transboundary water-related challenges and promote best practices.
c) Strengthening climate resilience in the water sector by incorporating adaptive measures into planning and design processes.
d) Promoting gender equality and social inclusion by integrating gender considerations into project design, implementation, and evaluation.
e) Fostering innovation and technological advancements to improve water resource management, increase water efficiency, and reduce water-related challenges.

Achieving SDG 6 is an essential global priority that requires robust and targeted efforts from stakeholders across sectors. By implementing the recommended actions and continuing to collaborate with partners, the EBRD remains committed to accelerating progress towards universal access to clean water and sanitation, contributing to sustainable development and the well-being of communities around the world.
