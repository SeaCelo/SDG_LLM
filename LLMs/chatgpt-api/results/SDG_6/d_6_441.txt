Introduction

Save the Children is pleased to present this detailed analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) - Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. This report is intended for an expert audience seeking an in-depth analysis of the current status, challenges, and recommendations for achieving the targets set out in SDG 6. Save the Children, with its extensive experience in humanitarian work and commitment to children's rights, aims to provide an insightful assessment of the progress made and the gaps that still need to be addressed.

Current Context and Challenges

The global water crisis remains a pressing challenge, as billions of people lack access to safe water and adequate sanitation facilities. The problem disproportionately affects marginalized communities, exacerbating existing inequalities. Achieving SDG 6 is essential not only for water and sanitation services but also for improving health, reducing poverty, and promoting gender equality.

Progress in Meeting Targets

Although some progress has been made, it is essential to acknowledge the significant gaps in achieving SDG 6. As per the latest available data, while 79% of the global population had access to safely managed water services in 2017, 2.2 billion people still did not have access to safely managed drinking water. Moreover, 4.2 billion people lack access to safely managed sanitation services.

In low-income and conflict-affected countries, the situation is even worse, with many lacking the infrastructure and resources to provide adequate water and sanitation systems. It is crucial to prioritize reaching these populations to ensure that no one is left behind.

Some progress has been observed in reducing open defecation, with approximately 1.7 billion people gaining access to basic sanitation since 2000. However, there still remains a need to significantly accelerate efforts to achieve universal access to improved sanitation facilities by 2030.

Challenges and Roadblocks

Progress has been hampered by several challenges:

1. Inadequate financing: Insufficient investment in water and sanitation infrastructure hinders progress toward SDG 6. Governments, donors, and international organizations must prioritize allocating adequate resources to support the implementation of sustainable projects.

2. Climate change and natural disasters: The increasing frequency and intensity of climate-related events pose additional challenges to water and sanitation infrastructure. Planning and adaptation measures must account for these risks to ensure resilience in the face of future climate challenges.

3. Inequality and discrimination: Marginalized communities, including rural populations, women, children, and people living in slums, face particular barriers in accessing water and sanitation services. Addressing inequality and discrimination is vital for achieving SDG 6 and leaving no one behind.

4. Poor governance and capacity building: Many countries face weak governance structures and inadequate capacity to manage and maintain water and sanitation systems effectively. Strengthening these areas is essential to ensure sustainability and long-term success.

Recommendations

To accelerate progress toward SDG 6, Save the Children recommends the following actions:

1. Increased financing: Governments, donors, and international organizations should increase investments in water and sanitation infrastructure to bridge the funding gap. Innovative financing mechanisms, such as public-private partnerships and impact investments, should be explored for sustainable and inclusive solutions.

2. Localization and community-led approaches: Promote community involvement and ownership in the planning, implementation, and monitoring of water and sanitation projects. This ensures that solutions are contextually appropriate, sustainable, and responsive to local needs.

3. Strengthening institutions and capacity building: Governments are encouraged to strengthen governance structures, invest in capacity building, and promote transparent and accountable water and sanitation management systems. Enhancing technical expertise, regulation, and coordination mechanisms are crucial steps towards achieving SDG 6.

4. Climate resilience and disaster preparedness: Integrate climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies into water and sanitation infrastructure development. This includes promoting nature-based solutions, building robust early warning systems, and investing in climate-resilient technologies and infrastructure.

Conclusion

While progress has been made towards SDG 6, significant challenges remain in ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. Achieving universal access to safe water and adequate sanitation is not only a goal in itself but also a fundamental enabler for achieving several other sustainable development goals. By implementing the recommendations outlined in this report and by collaborating with all stakeholders, we can make substantial strides towards achieving SDG 6 and creating a more sustainable and equitable future for all.
