The Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) presents this comprehensive analytical report addressing the progress made towards Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) in middle-income countries. SDG 6 aims to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all by 2030. 

Middle-income countries face a unique set of challenges in achieving SDG 6. Although progress has been made, significant disparities persist in access to clean water, improved sanitation facilities, and proper hygiene practices within these countries. This report delves into the key components of SDG 6 and uses a comparative analysis approach to shed light on the accomplishments, gaps, and potential solutions in middle-income countries.

Access to clean water is fundamental to the wellbeing and development of societies. While a significant proportion of the population in middle-income countries has access to improved drinking water sources, deficiencies become apparent when examining equity, quality, and reliability. Rural areas, marginalized communities, and informal settlements often face the greatest challenges in accessing clean and safe water. Appropriate infrastructure investments, targeted policies, and inclusive governance mechanisms are needed to bridge these gaps.

The lack of improved sanitation facilities poses serious public health risks. Despite progress, a substantial proportion of the population in middle-income countries still lacks access to adequate sanitation services, with similar equity issues as those observed for clean water access. Open defecation remains particularly prevalent in rural areas and informal settlements. The availability of quality sanitation services is intertwined with sewerage infrastructure, innovative technologies, behavior change, and hygiene promotion campaigns. Targeted interventions are imperative to ensure sustained access to proper sanitation facilities for all population segments.

Promoting safe and hygienic practices is essential to prevent the spread of diseases and improve overall wellbeing. However, behavior change and proper hygiene practices remain a significant challenge in some middle-income countries. Educational campaigns, community engagement, and robust institutional frameworks can enhance awareness and correct existing harmful behaviors. Additionally, gender and social equity considerations need to be integrated into policies and interventions, affirming the importance of inclusivity to achieve SDG 6 targets.

Middle-income countries face formidable financing gaps to achieve SDG 6. Investments in water supply, sanitation, and hygiene are often prioritized lower when compared to other pressing macroeconomic challenges. Both public and private financing mechanisms must be explored, including international cooperation, blended finance solutions, and strengthened domestic resource mobilization. The integration of SDG 6 into national development agendas and coordination among relevant institutions are key ingredients for resource allocation towards water and sanitation-related projects.

Policy integration and cooperation, both on the national and regional levels, are vital for the success of SDG 6 in middle-income countries. Paramount cooperation between governments, civil society organizations, the private sector, and academia can accelerate progress and minimize duplication of efforts. Stakeholders should collaborate to develop sound governance structures, knowledge sharing platforms, and monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. Progress can also be supported through international partnerships that aim to share experiences and best practices among middle-income countries facing similar challenges.

In conclusion, this analytical report highlights the progress and remaining challenges in achieving SDG 6 in middle-income countries. Despite advancements, equitable access to clean water, improved sanitation facilities, and proper hygiene practices still pose formidable difficulties. It is crucial for middle-income countries to prioritize SDG 6 financing, integrate it into national development agendas, and foster cooperation across sectors. By enhancing collaboration and addressing the unique circumstances of middle-income countries, we can work collectively towards ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation, thus unlocking a brighter future for all.
