The Sustainable Sanitation Alliance (SuSanA) is pleased to present this comprehensive analytical report on Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) for water and sanitation. Aimed at an expert audience, the report serves as an in-depth analysis of the current status of SDG 6, its achievements, challenges, and future recommendations.

SDG 6, titled "Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all," is a crucial goal that calls for universal access to clean water, adequate sanitation, and proper management of freshwater resources. It is imperative to address the complex interlinkages between water, sanitation, gender, climate change, and environmental degradation.

One of the significant achievements towards SDG 6 is the considerable progress made in access to improved water sources since the inception of the Millennium Development Goals. According to recent data, 91% of the global population has gained access to an improved drinking water source, demonstrating commendable progress towards this target. However, substantial regional disparities exist, with rural areas and marginalized communities still facing significant challenges in access to safe drinking water.

While progress in access to water sources has been significant, the global community faces immense challenges concerning sanitation. Approximately 2.3 billion people worldwide still lack access to basic sanitation facilities, such as toilets or latrines, with open defecation remaining a prevalent practice in some regions. The lack of proper sanitation facilities not only affects public health but also contributes to environmental pollution, waterborne diseases, and compromising dignity and safety, particularly for women and girls.

Furthermore, sustainable management of freshwater resources is essential for achieving SDG 6. Despite progress made in some areas, water scarcity and poor water quality remain pressing challenges. Water scarcity affects over 40% of the global population and poses severe threats to sustainable development, food security, and ecosystem health. Additionally, pollution from untreated wastewater, industrial effluents, and agricultural runoff further deteriorates water quality, affecting the health of both humans and ecosystems.

Addressing the challenges faced by SDG 6 requires a coordinated, multi-dimensional approach. To ensure sustainable water and sanitation services for all, it is essential to strengthen water governance structures, promote integrated water resources management, and invest in climate-resilient infrastructure. Aligning domestic policies with international commitments is necessary to leverage financial and technical support for developing countries.

Furthermore, decision-makers and practitioners need to recognize the strong linkages between water, gender, and public health. Gender mainstreaming in water and sanitation efforts, empowering women and girls, and ensuring their active participation in decision-making processes are critical for achieving universal access to water and sanitation.

Building on the progress made so far, the report puts forward several recommendations for advancing SDG 6. These include:

1. Mobilizing adequate financial resources to bridge the investment gap in water and sanitation infrastructure development, particularly in marginalized areas and low-income countries.
2. Enhancing partnerships and knowledge sharing between governments, civil society organizations, academic institutions, and the private sector to foster innovation, capacity building, and efficient water and sanitation management.
3. Strengthening monitoring and data collection systems to track progress, improve accountability, and inform evidence-based decision-making.
4. Promoting behavioral change through awareness campaigns, education, and community engagement, aiming at improving hygiene practices, reducing water wastage, and combating open defecation.
5. Incorporating climate change considerations into water and sanitation planning, ensuring the resilience of infrastructure, and promoting sustainable water use practices.

In conclusion, SDG 6 presents both significant achievements and ongoing challenges, underscoring the need for sustained commitment and action by all stakeholders. By addressing water and sanitation through an interconnected and holistic approach, governments, civil society organizations, and the private sector can contribute to building sustainable, resilient, and inclusive societies while leaving no one behind in the pursuit of this essential goal.
