Summary
This analytical report provides a detailed assessment of SDG 6, which aims to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. Developed by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), this report holistically examines the progress made towards the SDG 6 targets, analyzes the challenges faced, and proposes potential strategies to accelerate its achievement. It is intended for a knowledgeable expert audience working in the field of water and sanitation.

Introduction
SDG 6 plays a crucial role in ensuring access to clean water and sanitation, fundamental human rights that are crucial for achieving sustainable development. Despite significant progress being made globally, major challenges persist in achieving universal and equitable access to water and sanitation services. In order to gauge the progress and identify key areas requiring attention, this analytical report delves into the objectives of SDG 6, highlights the current status of its targets, examines key challenges, and proposes actions for accelerated progress.

Current Status
According to global data, clean water and safe sanitation remain inaccessible for many, particularly in developing regions. Around 785 million people still lack basic drinking water services, while 2.2 billion people currently do not have access to safely managed sanitation. This presents a severe impediment to achieving the goal of leaving no one behind.

Access to Water
Access to clean water, a pre-requisite for sustainable development, requires global attention. The report outlines geographic and socio-economic disparities in water access, highlighting rural areas, informal settlements, and conflict-affected regions as areas where progress is particularly challenging. Though progress has been made in urban areas, rural regions often face significant barriers such as inadequate infrastructure, limited financial resources, and inefficient governance systems. Acknowledging the differences among countries and regions, the report provides recommendations on targeted investments, improved technology, capacity building, and knowledge sharing to enhance access to clean water for all.

Sanitation Services
Improving sanitation services is also crucial as it significantly impacts human health, education, and overall socio-economic development. However, the data reveals that billions of people still lack access to proper sanitation facilities. Open defecation remains prevalent in certain regions, poses grave health risks and hampers sustainable development efforts. The report underlines the need for sustained investment in infrastructure, particularly in regions with limited access, enhanced efforts for behavior change, and strong multi-stakeholder collaborations. Additionally, adopting innovative and cost-effective sanitation solutions, such as decentralized treatment systems and reusing wastewater, can contribute to meeting SDG 6 targets.

Water Quality
Safe and reliable water supply necessitates addressing quality concerns, as inadequate treatment can result in waterborne diseases. This report stresses the importance of regular water quality monitoring and assessment, highlighting the need for well-trained professionals, robust laboratory and testing facilities, and effective governance structures. Strengthening legislation, supporting local communities in water protection initiatives, promoting ecological sanitation, and utilizing nature-based solutions are among the recommendations put forth to enhance water quality globally.

Integrated Water Resource Management
The report places emphasis on the importance of advancing integrated water resource management (IWRM) approaches to ensure sustainable use and conservation of water resources. It highlights effective water governance, stakeholder inclusion, cross-sectoral coordination, and capacity development as critical components of IWRM. Success stories from various countries, including Sweden, on promoting IWRM principles and policies, demonstrate the potential for achieving SDG 6 targets and provide practical insights for replication.

Conclusion and Recommendations
This analytical report underscores the urgent need for intensified efforts towards achieving SDG 6 by 2030. It outlines the crucial role of inclusive governance systems, innovative technologies, investment strategies, and stakeholder engagements in accelerating progress. The report emphasizes the importance of building sound partnerships and collaborations for knowledge sharing and capacity development. Furthermore, it underscores the requirement for robust monitoring mechanisms, data disaggregation, and targeted investments in regions facing the greatest challenges in water and sanitation. By incorporating these recommendations into national development strategies and ensuring their alignment with SDG 6, we can pave the way towards achieving water and sanitation for all, leaving no one behind.
